05. BATTLE OF BUITENZORG (5 March 1942)

STRATEGIC SITUATION:
The Allied situation on Java is getting worse every day. The Japanese have too many men and our forces are being pushed back and back. The Dutch commander on Java has decided that Batavia will be evacuated to reinforce Bandoeng in central Java. The direct road to Bandoeng has been cut off by Japanese forces so the force has to retreat through Buitenzorg where your forces next to Blackforce is deployed. It essential you hold the road open so we can fight another day! 

TACTICAL ORDERS:
The Japanese Nasu Detachment is pressing east to Buitenzorg after capturing Leuwiliang. After becoming aware of the single Dutch route of retreat goes through Buitenzorg, the Japanese have directed elements of two other Detachments to Buitenzorg too. The Japanese already have cut off one road. Two still remain. Your forces must hold your ground and push the Japanese back as well as holding Buitenzorg. The entire situation in western Java depends on the results of this action!
