It is time for us to end British domination over the entire Middle East. If we succeed, we may be able to influence the war in Russia by opening a new invasion route through the Caucasus. Your many objectives in the Middle East must be taken before major British reinforcements are able to arrive this fall, or all gains may be lost. In any event, we expect you to take your objectives by November 15th at the latest.
