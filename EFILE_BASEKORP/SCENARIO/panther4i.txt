Second Battle of Smolensk (7 Aug 1943)
First part of the "Defending The Reich" minicampaign.

STRATEGIC SITUATION:
After the failure of Zitadelle, Soviets started to push hard against the Axis.Germans tried to stop the onslaught by building Ostwall, an immense defensive line, with Smolensk being one of the key centres of defense.

TACTICAL ORDERS:
After an intense bombardment, the first line of defense is penetrated by the enemy, who's rolling deep into your territory. Your battalion is stationed right behind the front with a company of new Panther tanks. This is your first action as a freshly named battalion commander, and you are immediatelly rushed into the battle with a simple yet grave orders: destroy the enemy armoured spearheads, eliminate any further Soviet threat, and then retake the lost ground.

RECONNAISSANCE:
It seems like Soviet thrown one or two tank divisions against our sector, with a support of self-propelled artillery and heavy tank destroyers. They are determined to break through and won't crack easily. Luftwaffe lost local air superiority and you will lack any significant support. At least Soviet reserves are weak, but this in fact means that everything they got is just steamrolling its way towards you.

NOTE:
Expect lots of medium and heavy armour, and be mindful of enemy planes.

VICTORY CONDITIONS:
At the end of the 16th turn hold the required number of Victory Hexes to claim the corresponding victory.
