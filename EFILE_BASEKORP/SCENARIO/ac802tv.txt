Hello General!

We managed to drive back both Soviet divisions and Finland is relieved from the crises.  

We must spend time to rebuild our troops health and morale, this small victory came at great cost.  Hopefully the Soviets are more weary of this winter war than we and are ready to talk peace.

Now sir, warm yourself by the fire and let us plan our forward defenses and rotating troops from the front to get some much needed rest.
