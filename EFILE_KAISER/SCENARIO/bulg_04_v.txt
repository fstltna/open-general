The war is over! Tsar Ferdinand I is really pleased. He will be here tomorrow to visit the battlefield and will personally congratutlate you.
This has been a great victory for Bulgaria, General. Most of Thrace is ours and, when the Serbians fullfill our informal pre-war agreement, we'll also take possession of Vardar Macedonia.
Speaking of the matter, I wish that we had actually signed a treaty with our allies. They may be trustworthy, but you never know when disagreements can arise...
