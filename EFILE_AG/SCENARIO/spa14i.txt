AC 072 - Battle at Gallia Cisalpina (Schlacht bei Gallia Cisalpina)

After you defeated Gellius and Arrius, the path to freedom over the Alps, where many of your followers have their home, lays clear. But is the way really free? 
No! In the province of Gallia Cisalpina, strong Roman troops  under governor C. Cassius Longinus and praetor Cn. Manlius are awaiting you ...

Historical:
While Arrius newly arranged the battered legions of the two consuls, Spartacus moved further north, to the pre-Alpine province of Cisalpine Gaul.
Once again strong Roman troops under governor C. Cassius Longinus and praetor Cn. Manlius made a stand against him
Again the Thracian and his slave army won. Surprisingly, Spartacus chose to lead his army of slaves back into Italy.
