Come in General!  Outstanding Job you and your boys did!

Your troops caught the Russians as they were vulnerable and your men and pushed them back to their start lines!

More importantly we have re-established our defenses on the Don, but 4th Panzer Army could not break through and Hitler refused to allow a withdrawl!  4th Panzer Army is withdrawling back across the Chir and Manstein has called a General Cousel to discuss Strategy.
He will then fly to Berlin to directly persuade Hilter the reality of the situation, Madness!
You must come to this meeting, and pray, pray that we come up with a plan that Hitler will accept!
