The so-called Great Western Offensive has quickly bogged down. The British have achieved a limited success, but in general the Franco-British attack is being a costly waste of time for them. They'll still keep on trying, just like they did at the Somme, Chemin des Dames or Passendale, and just like we did at Verdun. But eventually it will be useless. There won't be a second Cambrai. 

However, you won't be here watching the Entente fail. The OHL has decided that for our final offensive we need even more men, and they can only come from the secondary fronts of Macedonia and Italy. We'll have to destroy the Entente forces there, just like we did in Russia. So the Balkans await you, General.
