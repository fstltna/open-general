Herr General,
The situation on the East front is not good after our abortive summer offensive. 
Soviet armies break defence on river Dnieper and now they threaten Kiev with diretc attacks from the East and the North.
Reports indicate another army is pushing up from the South. 
Holding Kiev may not be possible but withdrawing and counter-attacking may be a better option.
