Ah, Good day, Herr General!  Please sit down  and allow me to explain the present situation.  The Spanish Nationalists have requested the help of Germany to wrest control of Spain from their enemies. In leading this expedition, you will have the opportunity to sharpen your skills in the art of war. You will test the General Staff's new ideas regarding tank use, concentration of force, and combined arms operations.

We will be working closely with our allies, the Spanish Nationalists and the Italians.  Our friends the Italians have brought to this battle one of their elite units, an infantry unit with mountain training.  Use this unit with caution.  It is with us to gain experience, not to sacrifice itself needlessly.  It will be needed in future battles and must survive.  If we do well here we may gain an important ally in Spain as well.
