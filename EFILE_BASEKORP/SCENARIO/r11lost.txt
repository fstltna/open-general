LOSS

The enemy is taking control of Suchumi and a section of the coastal road. This means we are no longer able to fully supply our units near Novorossiysk, only by the means of our Black Sea Fleet. The front is collapsing and soon our glorious Black Sea Fleet will run out of ports! Report to Moskva or take life into your own hands...
