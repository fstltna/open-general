The First World War - Third Ypres - Poelcapelle (Poelkapelle)- Oct 9th, 1917

Ma chère,

It's amazing how fast the course of the war has improved for our country in just a few months. With Pétain  in charge, all the senseless operations have come to an end. He has agreed, in practice, to most of the demands of our troops, although at the same time he has punished some dangerous individuals who, under the proper circumstances, could have brought anarchy and chaos to France, just like it's happening in Russia.

While we wait for the deployment of the Americans, our army is only engaging in small, but strategically important battles. Or, as in my case, we're giving support to our British allies, who are pretty sure that this time they will finally break through the German lines in Flanders. I've heard that before, so I'm not so confident, but I'll do my best to help them. I've become friends with some of their officers, like John Monash or Bruce Dickinson.

I hope that the QG will authorize the permission that I've asked for, so I'll be at home for Christmas. I really wish so. I miss you very much,

Jean-Babtiste.
