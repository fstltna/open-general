1939-45 CZECHOSLOVAK CAMPAIGN

Czechoslovakia was the first country that was occupied by Germany against its wishes. Europe was not willing to wage war for this crime. But a force of Czechoslovakians escaped their country and would fight their enemy, the Germans, wherever possible. Small skirmishes in Polish Campaign were followed by seeking refuge in neutral Romania. From there on, the Czechoslovak Legion was evacuated to France. Here too, the Czechoslovaks were committed when the Germans were close to complete victory.

Yet, the Czechoslovaks continued their struggle to liberate their country. In the Middle-East they fought alongside the British in Operation Exporter. Then the Czechoslovaks became part of the famous garrison of Tobruk. They helped holding the port, and breaking its siege in Operation Crusader. After these adventures, the Czechoslovak brigade was used in France to capture the German-held port of Dunkirk. However, the Germans proved to be a worthy and excellent opponent despite years of fighting. The war ended with the Czechoslovaks still besieging Dunkirk, and finally accepting its surrender. In the days immediately following the war, a small force had been send through Germany to enter Czechoslovak territory again. A warm welcome in Prague was to be attended!
