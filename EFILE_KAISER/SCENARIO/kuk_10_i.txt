Limanowa

Dec 6th, 1914

Just as we feared, the Russians surpassed the defences of Premissel, trapping more than 150,000 imperial soldiers in the fortress, that is under siege right now. Brussilow's men are marching towards the Karpaten, and it seems that they won't stop until they take Krakau.

Von Hötzendorf has ordered a counteroffensive of our 3rd and 4th armies all along the front line. This will be our last chance to defend Krakau. If we succeed, the city will be safe at last, and we could even have a chance to relieve the siege of Premissel.

Your mission will be to defend the mountain passes near Limanowa, stop the Russians, counterattack and retake the villages that our enemies currently hold. Good luck, General, we count on you!

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.

Special note:
- A mountain brigade has beed added to your core.
