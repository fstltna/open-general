Comrade, the operation near Volodarka has not been a success. The Polish troops had cowardly tactics and hid themselves in the villages where our horses have little effect! However the fighting with the Polish cavalry showed that the people's Cavalry Army is a superior army!

There is more bad news.  The reason why you lost contact with the Don Cossacks Brigade was not your fault, comrade.  It seems that they have switched sides and have joined the capitalist criminals that we are fighting!  I urge you to make clear to your men the fate of such traitors!
