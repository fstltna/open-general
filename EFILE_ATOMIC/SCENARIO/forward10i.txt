Destroying the Demyansk Pocket
Comrade General, I have an easy mission for you. Since our offensive in the winter we could encircle the X. Army Corps near of Demyansk. Now we know that the Kampfgruppe Seydlitz is on her way to save the troops in the pocket. Stop the attack of Kampfgruppe Seydlitz and hold the pocket closen.
Your troops:
For this easy mission you will nearly only have your tank army. The deploy-hexes around the pocket are limited.
Enemy troops:
The X. Army corps has lost strength in the battles and have only a few divisions now. Kampfgruppe Seydlitz has an equal strength, but this troops are more dangerous. Do not miss to cut the Kampfgruppe Seydlitz off from the battlefield. They should arrive on our western flank in two days. Be aware of the German Luftwaffe. We have information that several bomber squadrons are in the combat area.
Sgn. Major Heinz
