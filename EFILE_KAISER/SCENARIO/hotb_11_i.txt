Saint Mihiel

September 12th, 1918

When the Germans invaded eastern France in 1914, one of their main goals was the taking of Verdun. They failed, but not before conquering the town of Saint Mihiel. Once the front stabilized the Krauts kept a salient around that town, with a high strategic importance. The French tried to expel the Germans from Saint Mihiel several times, to no avail.

Now we must triumph where our allies failed. We'll storm Saint Mihiel with the help of our artillery, our tanks, and the greatest concentration of planes that the world has ever seen. Naturally, the French will send some ground units, too. They don't want to miss this party.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the enemy VHs.
