BATTLE OF BRODY (29 July 1920)

The war is going excellently!  The Revolution will soon liberate the rest of Europe and join with other communists all over the continent!  But first we must concentrate on capturing Warsaw in the north and Lwow here in the south!

Yesterday your forces captured the town of Brody.  Your pursuit of the Polish Army has left them shattered and desperately awaiting reserves.  Let them tremble under the hooves of your horses!
