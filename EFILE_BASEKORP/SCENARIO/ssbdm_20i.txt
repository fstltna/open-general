  "Yes Fuhress,It will be in My Hands"  
 Frau General Ortrun Knapp was attacking the City of Leningrad by sea.The SS/BdM Air Korps blitz all across the Soviet frontiers had took it's toll.For 2 weeks now the Soviets with more aircraft than the World combined had been decimated by the 'Frau's.Over 2,000 planes had been destroyed allowing the Nazi's pilots Air-superiority and experience that could not be rivaled in the Dogfights over Mother Russia.The fortunes of the Soviets had gone sour and now the Dreaded Stuka's could roam at will destroying supply units behind the Frontier.And Leningrad was beseiged,the Soviet Forces in the Baltics running for their lives and the 'Kondors were ready to start missions far behind the Frontier.Joseph Stalin was in Shock from the attacks destroying His forces on the Fronts.Time and time again He had called Commanders to the Kremlin and after chewing them out then having the NKVD put them in front of firing squads.Four heads of the Red Air Force had met a similar fate.On hearing the SS was attacking Leningrad by sea Stalin retired to His Quarters,a bottle in hand and a few female clerks telling His Chief of staff to " let Him be until the Nazi's showed up at the Front Gates for He had no more answers for Himself or anyone else".So there It was,Stalin drunk and the 'Cradle of Bolshevik Revolution" under attack.
