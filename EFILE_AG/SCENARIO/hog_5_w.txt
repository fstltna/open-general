[The Supreme druid approaches towards you:] 

Gobannitio was defeated!
Vercingetorix is king of the kings of all tribes!

.... this has not happened since the oldest songs of the ancestors ..... but it must be:
The Romans are an enemy, as we have never met him before..... the Romans are not fighting for their fame and that of the gods; the Romans only know complete submission and enslavement ......!

If We want to remain free people, we must All follow Vercingetorix, and finally defeat the Romans!

.... I, the Supreme Druid, have spoken.
