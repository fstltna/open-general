Battle of Krivolak

November 3rd, 1915

While you  were fighting the Serbian Army at Ovche Pole, three French divisions advanced from Greece and have taken positions in Krivolak, south of Stip. They want to make contact with the renmants of the Serbian Army, thus avoiding its total encirclement. You must prevent them from doing that. You will attack the French Army and force it to retreat to Greece.
You must be careful. The French Army is experienced and well positioned, specially near Dolno Chichevo and Krivolak. They have blown all the existing bridges, so crossing the rivers  may prove difficult. Try to weaken the enemy with your artillery before crossing.

Victory conditions: Take all VHs.
