A MISSED OPPORTUNITY February12 1941

Take command of the Ariete Division that - with the Gruppo Sirte - is all that stands between Campo Tripoli with its 4 weak infantry divisions and O'Connor's forces.

The German Operation Sonnenblume is bringing the 5th Light Division over to North Africa. It's first elements should reach the front a few days from now.

Historic Note: 
This scenario is fiction. Churchill stopped O'Connor's offensive after the battle at Beda Fomm so that he could send all available forces to Greece. Only a skeleton force remained in Lybia. It would take more than 2 years before the Allies would get another shot at Tripoli.
