May, 9., 1865  The Key to Richmond


Dear Friend,
General Lee and President Davis flew to Richmond, capital of the CSA and their last stronghold. 
Our men are joyous and some are already celebrating victory. But I fear there is still some hard fighting in front of us. I don't have time for a long letter, they put us in railroad cars and some of us had to board ships in order to steam upriver. I hope, that the war will be over when you receive my next letter!


ORDERS: Sir, now that we took Petersburg, the confederates are retreating to Richmond, their last stronghold and capital of the Confederate States of America. You and your Army have been ordered to proceed northwards and approach Richmond from the south. Only the Fortifications near the James River lie between us and Richmond. 

Your orders are: Proceed northwards and take the Fortifications at Drewry's and Chaffin's Bluff and secure the Richmond & Petersburg Railroad. We captured a lot of locomotives and river steamboats at Petersburg, so transport of your heavy units should not be a problem. 

Our Marines already established a bridgehead at the western ferry station.

TAKE ALL VH's


NOTE: 
This is a fictive scenario.


ADVICE FROM YOUR OLDEST SERGEANT:
Maybe we should send some additional men to the east while our main force advance on the western shore.
