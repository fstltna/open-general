Gospodin General, the Marasesti Operation has been a success due to the excellent communication between you and our Romanian allies.  If in the fall of 1916, when our 4th and 11th Armies were transferred to the Romanian Front to stop the Germano-Bulgarian offensive, only 74 out of 609 front-line battalions were Romanian, then today the reorganized Romanian army (15 infantry and 2 cavalry divisions) has once again assumed command of their national front.

Our battle-weary divisions have been withdrawn, and a crisis hangs over the entire Russian army.  Forced into the deadlock of static trench defenses, the soldiers have succumbed to revolutionary propaganda and have begun to organize meeting committees at the front.  In these conditions, our front may not hold another offensive by the Central Powers.
