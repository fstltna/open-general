Krakow

We have crossed the Slovakian-Polish border, and our first important goal is the city of Krakow. The Polish Army of Krakow is taking positions to defend that city; they believe that they will be able to stop our attack, we will show them that they have not any possibility to stop our Panzerdivisionen. Luftwaffe units have destroyed most of the Polish Airforce on the ground, however the Polish army have yet some air units, so Luftwaffe reinforcements will arrive to help you; also, the 2nd Panzerdivision is on the way. Good luck.
