At the mountain of Cer

Aug 15th, 1914

The time has come. It's been two long months, but in the end we're here, ready to take revenge on the Serbians. We've crossed the Drina and now we must head towards Belgrad, in the east. Russia will attack our frontiers soon, so it's important to overcome the Serbian army as quickly as possible. However, don't underestimate them. The Serbians may be poor, and badly equipped, but they've won two wars in the last two years, against the Ottomans and the Bulgarians, so their troops are more experienced than ours. They're a tough bunch and besides, they know the terrain very well. They'll use the mountains and hills to their advantage. So be careful, and good luck!


Victory conditions:
- Take all the enemy VHs.

Intelligence report:
- There are at least eight Serbian divisions at the mountains. Don't try to advance too soon, and take some time to regroup your units. Right now, your artilleries are too far from the front line to be of any use.
