Early in March the Soviets had officially reported the capture of the Kuestrin Fortress and the Moscow garrison had even fired an honorary salute. Obviously this report had been wrong. But three weeks later the Soviets had finally captured the Fortress Kuestrin and connected the small bridgeheads into one large one about fifty kilometers wide and seven to ten kilometers deep. So in Moscow they fired the salute again. The preparations for the Berlin Operation, including the rebuilding of the heavy capacity bridges at Kuestrin, began.
The forces of Kuestrin managed a strong, but ultimately futile defense against a superior enemy. Following 59 days of heavy fighting the war finally ended for Kuestrin. The city suffered an enormous amount of destruction with 92 percent (in the Neustadt) to 100 percent (in the Altstadt) destroyed which made it one of the most devastated cities of the war. But approximately 1000 men, including fortress commander Reinefahrt, escaped back to their own front lines against Hitler's order.

During the february and march fightings the Germans lost about 40.000 men while the Soviets lost about 62.000 men.
