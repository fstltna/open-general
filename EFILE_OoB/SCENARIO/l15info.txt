15. CILLI (10 May 1945)

To the commanding officer of 22. ID (LL):

Germany has capitulated. Berlin has fallen and all of Germany and Austria has been occupied by Allied forces. The retreating Heeresgruppe from the Balkans is still active though and is hoping to reach the Austrian border to surrender to British authorities rather than to the Yugoslav Army.

While the Korps is negotiating a surrender with the Yugoslav formations following us, your division will not hesitate to retreat further in the direction of the Austrian border. The enemy is following and is most likely willing to hold you down. We are so close, several dozens of kilomters, to the Heimat - this is not the time to stop!

RULES: 
- Do not upgrade, sell or buy units - nor upgrading transports.
- Replacing lost units is not allowed anymore.
