Once again, the Italians didn't resist the pressure, and they retreated despite the casualties that they had inflicted on us. I guess that their morale was terribly low at that time.

With the taking of Keren, followed by the conquering of Asmara three days later, we finally controlled all the Eritrean Highlands and the mountain passes. Bogos, Hamasien and all the other regions that Menelik II had ceded to Italy were again in Ethiopian hands.

We didn't advance any further. In the coastal regions, the guns of the Royal Navy would be lethal for our troops, and we wanted to avoid those unnecessary losses. While we were fighting in Eritrea, the British had made a surprise attack against Gondar, and dealing with the new invaders was our priority. In order to fight against the British and, at the same time, defend the Eritrean Highlands and our other borders, we needed all the men that we could gather. I wasn't going to lose them by making foolish advances without any hope of victory. No, the ports of the Red Sea would have to wait.

Fortunately for us, an attack from the Entente forces against Eritrea was highly unlikely. One month after the battle of Keren, the Germans crushed the Italian army in Caporetto, and Italy was on the verge of surrender. In just a few weeks, Ethiopia had become the least of Italy's problems, so they wouldn't bother us.
