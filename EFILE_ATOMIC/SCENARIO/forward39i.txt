Zhitomir Counterattack
Unfortunately, I have to interrupt your vacation. While we have refitted your troops the situation near Zhitomir have changed in a serious way. The Germans have started a counterattack with five tank divisions after we have recaptured Kiev. Hold Zhitomir and stop every advance to Kiev.
Your troops:
Because of the refits not every of your unit had marched of simultaneously. In the Zhitomir area you will have only a few troops in the beginning. You can calculate with an arrive of your other troops in some days. The 94. Rifle Division defends Zhitomir. These troops will also be under your command.
Enemy troops:
The Germans are not numerous, but they have some serious tanks. Because of the near of the Germans to Zhitomir they may be able to lead a devastating attack onto your troops. So, be careful.
