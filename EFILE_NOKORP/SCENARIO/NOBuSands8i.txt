We have cleaned the strategically important coastal road of all British presence, but one small problem remains: There are pockets of resistance left, way inland, in the desert, supplied from rogue french colonies in central Africa.
We can't leave them there, they will come back to bite us when we least expect it. Meaning you'll have to leave the relative comfort of the Via Balbia and push inland for some time. Fortunately fuel and supplies have arrived at last.

We are worried they might be preparing a counterattack as we speak, and we need you to go protect the strategic Buma radio station. We need to preserve that important communications node operational at all cost, losing it would disrupt our North African strategy for months.



Instructions: Capture all VHs. Beware, the radio station is MSU.
