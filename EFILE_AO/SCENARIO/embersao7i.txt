RETALIATION

Ryburn's Diary - February 14th, 2054

"Our own leader --- betrayed us!"

"As the highest ranking officer left alive, I have taken control of the forces that survived Phoenix's gambit.   The remnants of the Arm surrendered to us and I've got some ex-government types under me now, too."

"That madman must want nothing but power -- raw power.  I have no idea why else he would have attacked us, at the height of our victory.  Am I a threat to him?  Were his other generals?"

"None of this matters now.  What matters is sustaining the momentum we regained.  It's time to strike back at Phoenix's headquarters and kill the bastard before he can wreak any more havoc."
