BACKGROUND

15th USAAF made 1373 sorties and drooped 3000 tons of bombs, while BAF made some 600 fighter sorties. Allied air force destroyed 112 locomotives, 243 motorized transports and 413 railway carts, also attacks on the airfields destroyed 94 aircraft crippling Luftwaffe strength in Yugoslavia. The Long Range Desert Group and the Special Boat Service destroyed bridge near Gruda and attacked coastal targets in Dubrovnik region, while Royal Navy harassed German sea traffic.

Yugoslav partisans among other things, captured eight communication centers, 49 railway stations or strongholds, destroyed 77 kilometers of railroad tracks, 97 road and railway bridges, also cut 77 kilometers of phone and telegraph lines.

Axis forces had suffered 4187 killed, around 2000 wounded and 5782 captured soldiers. Railway traffic was interrupted for two to three weeks during vital period of German retreat from Balkan (Greece, Bulgaria, Romania) in front of advancing Soviet army allowing for quick liberation of Belgrade.

In following weeks Army Group E narrowly avoid being cut off and destroyed because while RATWEEK prevented timely arrival of reinforcements to Belgrade, evacuation of German garrisons from the islands went mostly uninterrupted until last possible moment (thousands of troops still had to be abandoned on Crete which remained occupied until end of the war) despite little or no protection and when finally Germans began their retreat from Greece operation ended with most Allied air-power diverted to support operations on Gothic line in Italy, another week of bombing would probably delay Army Group E enough to make escape impossible.
