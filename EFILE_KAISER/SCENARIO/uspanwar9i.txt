General,

Following the uprising of Filipino rebels, Manila is now under siege. Since June 1898, the city has been completely surrounded by Aguinaldo's Filipino rebel ground forces. Some 30,000 Filipino troops had dug fourteen miles of trenches around Manila. 

Aguinaldo has presented surrender terms to Spanish Governor General Basilio Augustín but not surprisingly he has refused them.

Now Filipino troops are trying to seize control of Manila's only pumping station in Santolán and cut off the water supply to the city.

You have to ensure that Santolán pumping station remains in our hands.

Victory conditions: To take all VHs by turn 8 for a BV, turn 10 for a V and turn 12 for a TV.
