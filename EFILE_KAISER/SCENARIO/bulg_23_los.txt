At least the Germans broke the enemy line and are about to take Konstantia, but you haven't been able to offer them any real support. In the eyes of our allies we have become an unreliable army, capable of great deeds, but also of great failures. It's not all your fault, but you have a measure of responsability for it. You'd better ask for your transfer to a secondary front.
