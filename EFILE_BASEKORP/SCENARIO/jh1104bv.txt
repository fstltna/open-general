Outstanding performance, Herr General.  But things are not going well in Russia. Feldmarschall Paulus has been unable to break out of Stalingrad.  Worse, intelligence indicates that the Bolsheviks are planning a great offensive in the Kursk region.  Therefore we must quickly take Alexandria so that Egypt and the Suez Canal can be conquered.  You are given a key role in the capture of Alexandria.
