Situation:
The 7th Army and the 5th Panzer Army are on a retreat. The pocket is not closen yet. In the north the western part of the 1st Canadian Army soon will have contact with the enemy. In the east the 1str Polish Armoured Division holds the hills north of Mont Orme. In the south a French Armoured Division will arrive the battlefield in a few days. Certainly the Germnans will try to break up the pocket also from the outside. These troops on the east of the Dives River  have to focus on attacks at their back, too.

Orders:
- Close the pocket
- Do not let the Germans flee
- Destroy 80 enemy units (not only the units in the pocket)

A few hints:
The french division will not be in time in Chambois to prevent the Germans to cross the Dives. Therefore it could be a good idea to build a hooker east of the Dives and trap the Germans with the Canadians in the north, the Polish units in the east and the French units in the south and the Dives in the west.
As long as the Germans are a closen formation an attack can inflict heavy losses to your army. As soon as they will split of to cross the Dives there is a good chance to roll up the Germans from behind.

Please note: The aux bombers had used most of their ammunition before the battle begun. They only ha´ve one shot at the beginning of the scenario.
