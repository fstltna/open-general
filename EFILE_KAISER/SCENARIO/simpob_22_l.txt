The Bolsheviks defended themselves like true heroes, not hesitating to sacrifice their lives if they could delay us for a few hours. They did that again and again, so when we finally reached the Tobol it was too late. The surviving communists had already crossed the river, had built strong defensive positions, and they simply had to wait until their reinforcements came. We had touched victory with the tips of our fingers, but we had let it go. Now it was all over.

Two weeks later the Soviets counterattacked. Most of our army retreated to Petropavlosk, but I was captured in one of the first skirmishes. Surprisingly, they didn't kill me on the spot, and they brought me to this camp instead. That's how I ended here.

I know that I won't live for much longer. The guards will kill me if disease doesn't do it first. I've told you everything that I remember about these months of war, hoping that, someday, one of you will be able to leave this country. When that moment comes, tell the world what really happened. Please, I beg you, don't let all of this be forgotten.
