Comrade Marshal, in view of the existing military and political situation, STAVKA has decided that the Berlin operation should be launched no later than April 16th, so here we are! Reviewing the plan once more: The main thrust toward Berlin and the capture of the city are entrusted to You and the 1st Belorussian front. Marshal Konev's 1st Ukrainian front is to strike from the Neisse river against enemy forces south of Berlin and cut off the main force of Army Group Center, thus securing your operations from the south. Konev should then be in a position to strike at Berlin from the south if necessary. Since Rossokovsky's 2nd Belorussian front will not be able to cross the Oder river before April 20th, you will have to advance with an uncovered right flank for the first crucial days of the operation, but, we have faith in your abilities!
