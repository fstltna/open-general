Osowiec, 12 February 1915

Gospodin General-Leitenant, the situation on the North-Western Front is becoming critical!  It appears that Stavka's offensive plans may be abandoned:  following the defeat of our 2nd Army at Tannenberg, the German 8th and the newly formed 10th Armies have begun the campaign to recapture lost territory in Prussia and Masuria.

The Germans have captured the initiative and have forced our 10th Army to slowly retreat through the Augustow Forest.  This has created a dangerous gap of 50 km on the north flank.  Von Hindenburg, sensing another opportunity to encircle large numbers of our forces, has rushed the XXXVIII and XXXIX Reserve Corps to exploit the gap.

It appears that the XL Reserve Corps from the 8th Army was sent along the Bobr River to meet the forward elements of the 10th with the goal of trapping the majority of the 10th (III, XX, and III Siberian Corps) in a cauldron.  You will be deployed as the XX Corps, charged with the task of holding the German onlaught in the Augustow Forest.  The fortress of Osowiec will serve as the hinge of your left flank.

Gospodin General-Leitenant, do not allow another Tannenberg to be repeated!
