Osel (Saaremaa) Defense
October 12, 1917

Major, The Russo-German front has collapsed.  In September, Riga fell to an unprecedented stormtrooper attack.  The Russians have retreated in disarray.  All that prevents the Germans from rolling toward Tallinn and Petrograd is the island-fortress of Osel (Saaremaa).

Intelligence reports that a force of gargantuan proportions is being assembled for the assault.  Unfortunately, your regiment is slated to join the defenders.  The Estonian HQ believes that sending your regiment to Osel is a hopeless task.  Care has been taken to ensure sufficient transport remains on Osel to evacuate your regiment.  Your orders for this mission are as follows:
1. Fortify along positions of Ft. Orissaare, Ft. Woi, and Kuresaare.
2. Hold your positions until you are relieved.
3. Your signal for retreat will be the appearance of trooper barges in the harbor of Latti.  To end the scenario, "capture" the city of Latti.  In order to achieve a satisfactory win, you MUST wait until trooper barges arrive!  Please note that a Brilliant Victory is not possible in this scenario.
