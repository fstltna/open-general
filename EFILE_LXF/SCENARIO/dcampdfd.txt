1940-49 DUTCH CAMPAIGN

You start in May 1940 when Germany invades the neutral country of the Netherlands. You will challenge the Germans but they prove too strong. You get evacuated to the Dutch colony of the Dutch East Indies where the Japanese attack in 1942. Again the war is lost. But in 1943 you hold the Japanese at Merauke and are being brought back to Europe where Operation Market-Garden has started on Dutch soil. You will fight the Germans in heavy battles in will reconquer the southern part of the Netherlands. In May 1945 the Germans surrender and your men will take part in the last episodes of the Pacific War and retake Tarakan from the Japanese in the Dutch East Indies. But as soon as the war ends, many colonies of European powers, including our Dutch East Indies, are in uprising and demanding independence. Diplomatic negotiations are taking months and years. And in 1949 the Netherlands accept the independence of the Republic of Indonesia. But before that two large scale military actions have been undertaken to reclaim the colony!
