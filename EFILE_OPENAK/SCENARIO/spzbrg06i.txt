Onslaught of Low Countries

Part 1/3 of the "Westfeldzug" minicampaign


"Herr Oberst! Herr Oberst! The road is jammed! What?! I don't know! Looks like some harebrained tankists ran into the city without proper reconnaisance and they have fallen into trap! There are hundreds of Dutchmen all over the place! What! I don't hear you! Ja! Ja! They have everything - mortars, artillery, PaKs, everything! And I think... Scheisse! Mein Gott! Stukas!

Herr Oberst! The Luftwaffe has just blown the bloody place! I can't see anything! What?! No, the road's not free! We're moving westwards, there should be another two bridges, unless the map is incorrect! I'll contact you once we find out what the situation really is!"


Victory conditions: After 10 turns hold four VHs for a BV, three for a V and two for a TV.

Hint: You must undone what the runaway tankists did.
Meanwhile find the way across the river and clean the area - capture as many VHs as possible - so that the bulk of our army does not lose time in the traffic jams and may use the secured passages.
Our air support must return to the bases soon, but once they stow new loads, they'll be back again. Until then...

Warning 1: Hold the two initial German VHs, if you lose them both, you'll lose the scenario. The tankists will pay dearly for their impatience, thankfully the supporting infantry is not very far away, but as they've left their lorries after they ran out of the fuel, it may take several hours before they come.

Warning 2: This scenario uses limited deployment, use the "View the Strategic Map" feature first!

Core reinforces (2/3): During the Polish campaign weve realized that our Pz I tanks are very weak namely against enemy armour. Many of them were withdrawn from the combat units and converted to tank hunters and self-propelled artillery. You were chosen to test them in combat and thus your artillery section will be reinforced.
