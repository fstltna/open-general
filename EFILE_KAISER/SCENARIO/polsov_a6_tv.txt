You have decided to go to the POW camp and spend the rest of the war playing handball - a game that was recently invented. 

This game (literally pi³ka rêczna) is also called "szczypiorniak" after the POW camp Sczypiorno, when the legionists played it. 



You will be awarded with 792 pps (at least). Buy transport for infantry, recon and something else.
