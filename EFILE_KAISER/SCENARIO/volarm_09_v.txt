The Bolsheviks have been routed and are fleeing in panic. In a few days Kursk will be ours.
The news from other sectors of the front are good, too. In Tsaritsyn our men have repelled an enemy offensive that tried to recover the town. And in Ukraine our troops have taken Kiev and Odessa.

But, although it's somewhat annoying, I won't be able to enjoy my victory. Not all the news from Ukraine are good. Nestor Makhno and his army of anarchist peasants want to help the Reds now, and they have invaded Western Ukraine. We just have a handful of soldiers in that area, and our supply lines are too long and very vulnerable, so Makhno could make us a lot of damage, even threatening our offensive on Moscow. I must go to Uman and put an end to this menace.
