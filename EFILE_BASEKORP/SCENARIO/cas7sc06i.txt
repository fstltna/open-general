General, first of all, don't ask me why your unit has been assigned to this task, but I think you'll be transferred further north later on. The objective of the day is to secure Denmark. The Danish army is a joke with only two divisions, and only one of them is posted along the border. Crush them and take them prisoners. Secure all objectives in one day.
