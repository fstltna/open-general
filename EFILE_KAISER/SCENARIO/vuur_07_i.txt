Silkaatsnek

July 11th, 1900

Our scouts have brought information that the Silkaatsnek Pass is being defended by a small British garrison. They're so overconfident that they haven't deployed any platoons on the higher ground.This may be a great opportunity for winning an easy victory and for gathering weapons to rearm our men.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.
- Your MSU core unit must survive.
