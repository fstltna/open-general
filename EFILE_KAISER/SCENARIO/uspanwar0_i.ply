The Margallo War
(2-28 October 1893)
v.0.1
The sunset of the Spanish Empire - The Spanish American War 1898

Teniente,

As you know the fortifications surrounding Melilla are being expanded and new redoubts are being erected. Unfortunately a holy place has been demolished and Moroccans across the province have rushed to arms against Spain and called for a jihad.
 
Some 25,000 Rifian warriors have descended from the mountains and attacked Melilla's garrison (about 3,000). The situation is critical. Troops are retreating to Melilla which may be soon under siege (a civilian corps has been organized to aid in the defence).
 
You will command the relief troops.

For the first time, your troops will wield the formidable 7 mm Mauser Model 1893's. 

Victory conditions: Hold 7 hex for a BV, 5 for a V and 3 for a TV.

Paqueo,
