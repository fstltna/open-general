00. BORDER ATTACK (1 October 1938)

The United Kingdom and France have given us permission to annexate the Sudetenland, currently belonging to Czechoslovakia. But the Czechs are not willing to pass this land over without a fight. Preparations for this campaign have been made. The Czechs have one of the most modern armies in Central and Eastern Europe. Our army is unexperienced and this invasion will be our first major military action since the Great War. The outcome is all but sure.

Our First Army Group contains four armies ready to invade Czechoslovakia from all sides possible. Our battleplan sends the 8th, 10th and 12th Armies to march to Prague directly while all other forces make secondary attacks and defend the Reich.

Your regiment is attached to 44th Infantry Division which is attached to 14th Army stationed in Austria. As the main assault will be directed at Prague directly, your attack will be a secondary one. You have orders to cross the border and to punch through the Czech border fortifications and establish a bridgehead over the Dyje River and secure a supplyline to the bridgehead because we do not posses the forces to attack over a wide local front.
