Kahe Station

After the retreat from Salaita and Latema, von Lettow-Vorbeck forces regrouped at Kahe.  Here they planed to stop the British long enough for the start of the rainy season.  This would make any British pursuit nearly impossible.

Victory conditions: Defend as many VHs as you can; don't allow the British to conquer Masai Kraal and Kahe Station before turn 6.
