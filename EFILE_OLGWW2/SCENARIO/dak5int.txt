Pursuit to Mechilli

January 25th - 1942

After our success in the retaking of Mersa el Brega and Agedabia, the counteroffensive must continue. The British are now trying to regroup some units in the Beda Fomm - Bengazhi - Mechilli area. These units are surely the remnants of the enemy 1st Armored Division, and the 4th Indian division, which intelligence reports indicate is deployed around Bengazhi.

The mission is to re-establish the 1941 lines here, capturing Bengazhi, and then, reaching Mechilli.

Viel Gluck Herr General!
