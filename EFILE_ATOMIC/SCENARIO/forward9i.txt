Urban Warfare in Moscow
This is our last opportunity. The Germans have advanced to the western periphery of Moscow. Hold Moscow at any costs!
Your troops:
You have we command over a tank division, the Moscow garrison and several bunkers and pillboxes. We have tried to mine the way for the German divisions but we could not finish this.
Enemy troops:
You are facing several tanks and infantry divisions. Moreover, you should calculate with heavy attacks from the German Luftwaffe.
