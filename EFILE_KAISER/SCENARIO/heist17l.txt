Kindralleitnant,
   
The Petrogard offensive has drowned in a river of blood at Luga.  Estonia has withdrawn her troops from Yudenich's offensive and has pledged to provide material support to his army.  You have been recalled to Tallinn and will be asked to present a full report to the Ministry shortly upon your arrival.
