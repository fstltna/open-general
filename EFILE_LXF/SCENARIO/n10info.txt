MUNSAN-NI (22 March 1951)

Comrade General, follow me into this room.  Here.  This map is top secret.  You can see the advance that the imperialists have made.  In the central and eastern sectors heavy opposition was encountered from the enemy armies and we slowly gave ground, but always organized!   We do not run off like scared the capitalist dogs!  All has been quiet in the western sector and we have almost totally evacuated the region between the Imjin and Han Rivers.  We don't want the enemy to trap us there.  There is only a Chinese rearguard and some of your units still there.  Just half an hour ago I was ambushed by those capitalist swine when driving to Corps HQ.  It seems the enemy has sent in reinforcements from the air to block our retreat.  Yes, Comrade General, indeed.  We just evacuated the bulk of your forces but now go and quickly get your remaining troops out.  Seoul has just been recaptured and we will be under attack from multiple sides!  Once the road is opened we will drive to HQ in Kaesong!  Now hurry up, Comrade General, there is no time to waste!
