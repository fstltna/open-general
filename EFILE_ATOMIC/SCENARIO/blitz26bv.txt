Well done Herr General! Your capture of Moscow once again showed your mastery of tactics. The Bolsheviks still refuse to surrender but have offered us an armistice. Our intelligence indicates that the Allies are planning an invasion of Europe early this summer. Therefore the High Command signed the armistice with the Bolsheviks so we can prepare for the pending invasion. You are to be transferred to the Western Front, where you will help defend Fortress Europe against an Allied invasion.
