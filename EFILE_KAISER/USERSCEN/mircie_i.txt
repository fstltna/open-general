Warsaw: The Miracle of Ciechanów

August 13, 1920

In august 1920 the Russian Red Army was ready for its final assault on Warsaw. As the Russian troops crossed the Wkra River and advanced towards Modlin Fortress, the Polish defeat seemed inminent. The Russians wanted to break the Polish defences north of Warsaw, allowing them to strike from behind the city.
Polish last hope was the counterattack that commander Jósef Pilsudski was preparing from the south. But in the meantime the Polish 5th Army under General Wladyslaw Sikorski would have to defend the northern area near the Modlin Fortress from an enemy that had superior numbers.
