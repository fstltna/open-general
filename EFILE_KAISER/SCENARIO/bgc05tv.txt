Our landing has been successful, General! The troops came ashore, overrun the surprised enemy and even reached the high ground of Tekke Tepe. Unfortunately, the Turks have responded quickly and we had to retreat from the heights when two new Turkish divisions appeared on the scene.

HISTORICAL OUTCOME:
While Stopford, the commanding general at Suvla, went to sleep on HMS Jonquil, the landing in pitch darkness ended in great confusion with units becoming mixed and officers unable to locate their position or their objectives. 
In the morning, General Stopford refused to advance without substantial artillery support - giving the Turks enough time to bring two divisions from Bulair to Suvla. General Hamilton, dismayed by the lack of progress and the absence of any drive from Stopford, intervened on 8 August. But precious time had already been lost, and when 32nd Brigade approached the summit of Tekke Tepe on 9 August, they met with strong Turkish reinforcements that virtually annihilated the brigade in a matter of minutes by a bayonet charge.
Hamilton wrote in his diary:
"My heart has grown tough amidst the struggles of the peninsula but the misery of this scene wellnigh broke it... Words are of no use."
