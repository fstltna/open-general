25. RUSE (8 September 1944)

While the front against the fascists moves west, into Yugoslavia, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland, your force will used in a special mission. Bulgaria and our Soviet Union have never been in war. However the Bulgarians sided with the German fascists. Three days ago we have declared war on Bulgaria. Bulgaria still had German troops on its soil. The Bulgarian Army has been given orders not to fire on our troops. However like in the Rumanian Army there are still fascists in their lines and they will fire back. It is also possible that some units have not received the order. It is a confusing situation again. 

Your force, located near Bucharest, must cross the Danube River at two of its crossings. Near Ruse and near Turlukai. After the crossing you must drive deep into Bulgaria and take control of all important positions. Be aware of fascist, resisting troops, comrade.
