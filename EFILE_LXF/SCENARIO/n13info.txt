MAJON-NI (11 November 1950)

Comrade General, our Chinese comrades are pushing south.  Since September we have left many troops behind during our retreat north.  Partisan groups have been formed to harass enemy communications and other targets in its rear.  However strong leadership can only help.  You will be flown by a small aircraft to a partisan group near the village Majon-ni halfway between Wonsan and our capital P'yongyang.  You will lead operations against the enemy there.  We know little but it appears that a South Korean battalion has been cut off.  American troops are on the way to rescue them.  You know what to do.

In two weeks the Chinese should have passed your area and you will be put back in command of your refitted troops.  Until then, harass the enemy as much as possible, destroy as much equipement as possible and show them that the communist cause will be victorious even after many bad turns!

Technical note: you will not be able to deploy any core units in this scenario. However from the next scenario onwards you can again.
