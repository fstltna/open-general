Since you got stuck at the Dojransee, our victory in the Balkans will take longer and will be harder. At least the Germans have destroyed the Entente army in Bitola, and now they're marching towards Athen. Well, let's forget about this. You'll be sent to the Italian front again, and I hope you'll show there that you've learnt from your mistakes.
