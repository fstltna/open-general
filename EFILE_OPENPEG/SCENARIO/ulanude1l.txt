A major defeat like the one you suffered at Ulan Ude is the sort of setback which can reverse the tide of war. With your foolhardy maneuvers, you dashed our troops’ hopes for a swift end to the war just when morale was at its highest. Too many soldiers have sacrificed their lives to drive the Chinese army to its knees for you to let them back up. The Joints Chiefs of Staff cannot afford to risk another such defeat and have released you from further duties.
