For several weeks after San Jacinto, Santa Anna continued to negotiate with Houston, Rusk, and then Burnet. The Treaties of Velasco required that all Mexican troops withdraw south of the Rio Grande, but the Mexican authorities refused to officially recognize the Republic of Texas, and intermittent conflicts between the two countries continued into the 1840s. The annexation of Texas as the 28th state of the United States, in 1845, led directly to the Mexican–American War.
