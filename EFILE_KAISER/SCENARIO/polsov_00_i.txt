Wilno offensive

April 18th, 1919

This scenario was designed by Urica (for his Polish-Soviet campaign) and it was he who also inspired me to design this small campaign.

Good morning, Colonel. 
We have just secured the position for the assault. Easter is coming so try to liberate the city before the holiday. I think the citizens will help you and I hope there will not be too many casualties. Our young army proved its value as did the Red Army. Take Wilno back. 

Orders: Keep 1. pu³k piechoty alive. Liberate Wilno and secure the roads heading north and east from the town. Take all VHs.

Intelligence report: There are more enemy regiments in the area. There is not only the Western Division, allegedly Polish,  but also a division from Pskow. Wilno is heavilly garrisoned by remnants of the previously beaten enemy that can also be found outside the town. There is a possibility that Polish citizens of Wilno will stand against the Communists. Don't expect further reinforcements.

Good Luck!
