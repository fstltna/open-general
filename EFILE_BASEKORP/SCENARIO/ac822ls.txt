Grand Council of Italia.

The people mourn the tragedy of our loss!

Our forces were rebuffed as the Germans withdrew taking thousands of Italian POW's with them.

We had hoped this operation would prove to the world that Italia is NOT a bunch of Mussilinni drones, but.....we have failed.

The commander is missing, he was last seen rallying the a tank assault into the 4th SS Panzergrenadiere's sector to close the Thermoplyae road.

Now if you excuse me, I must mourn my own son's death as well.
