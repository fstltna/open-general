Operation Manych

May 1st, 1919

The attack of the 10th Army on the Manych was a very serious threat to us. When they took Torgovaya they could split our lines in two, and even Ekaterinodar was at risk. Thank God that our campaign in the Terek ended soon, so we could send reinforcements just in time. Now the Bolshevik offensive has lost its initial momentum, and the initiative is ours again. We must send them back to the other side of the river, thus securing our right flank.

I hope that Anatoly is ready for this battle. He's a major now, so his responsabilities are greater. But now that Katya has told him that we approve it, it seems that his mind is only set on his engagement with that nurse of the Kornilov regiment. He shouldn't forget that this is a war, and that any distraction can have a terrible cost. I have confidence in his sense of duty, but maybe I should have a conversation with him about the matter.

Victory conditions: 
- Take all the VHs.
