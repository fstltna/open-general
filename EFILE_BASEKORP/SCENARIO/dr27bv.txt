The Falaise Gap - August 1944 BV

"The misery around us screams to high heaven. Refugees and soldiers from the broken German armies look helplessly at the bombers flying continuously overhead. It is useless to take cover from the bursting shells and bombs." Kurt Meyer

Congratulations. Most troops were able to get out of the Falaise pocket. Retreat east to form a new line of defense.
