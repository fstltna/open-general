Odrin fortress

March 24th, 1913

For more than three months the Ottoman garrison at Odrin has refused to surrender. Before the war the Turks built a formidable fortress around the town, with nearly inexpugnable lines of fortifications and trenches. But now, after weeks of artillery fire, and with the help of two Serbian divisions, our Second Army has weakened the Turkish defences enough to make a final assault.
The Ottoman garrison is starving and suffering from disease, but we can't afford waiting until they decide to surrender. Inactivity is making the morale of our troops go down, and they have suffered greatly during the cold winter. We need to end this war at once.
Don't underestimate the enemy. They may be weaker now, but their defences stand still, and some of their soldiers are veterans.

Victory conditions: Take all VHs.
