Erzerum, 12 February 1916

Gospodin General,
The Kavkaz Front has resolved to strike the Turkish 3rd Army at Erzerum.  The attack has been planned in extreme secrecy to take place during winter months - a move Turkish command does not expect.  The Kavkaz Army (II Turkestansky and I Kavkazky Corps) has achieved surprise over the enemy and has deployed in a semi-circle around Erzerum and its outlying forts.

Erzerum's fortifications have been modernized by the British after the Russo-Turkish War of 1865 and again by the Germans in 1910.  Expect heavy mortars to resist your assault.

You must dismantle Turkeys last line of fortifications at the base of the Kavkaz Mountains.
