In 1942, you were forced to flee Luzon in the face of the Japanese Army, now it is your chance to turn the tables on the enemy.  We have chosen the same landing beaches that the Japanese used: the beach at Lingayen Gulf. Our initial landings have met with heavy resistance from the enemy. You will need to bring in more reinforcement to win a victory here.
