Situation report: The Japanese are really on the ropes as their foothold on New Guinea grows smaller. Many of their units are scattered throughout the mountains and jungles and their attacks have become less and less organized as our offensive gathers strength. The Japanese have managed to group together a sizable force in the vicinity of Madang and are set to launch an attack on our positions.

Operational orders: Your primary mission here is to hold our present position south of Madang. The enemy will try his best to dislodge our forces from the area. Intelligence has reported that the enemy has shipped in fresh units of Jungle Warfare specialists to aid in their attack.
