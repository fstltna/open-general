
AMIENS I - 21 MAY 1940

Yesterday the German Panzers have reached the Channel. The Armies in the north have been cut off from the southern Armies. However the corridor that divides them is not yet strong nor wide. A counterattack must be able to regain contact.

The new Supreme Commander, General Weygand who has replaced General Gamelin, is busy with coordinating such a counterattack. The plan will be to have British and French forces attack from the north, while other French forces attack from the south. 

However the Germans are establishing bridgeheads over the Somme River. They already have taken Amiens. You have orders to block further German advances and gain positions at the Somme. Taking Amiens might be out of your league - after all, our forces are scattered and still arriving, partly from the Maginot Line. Vive la France!

GOAL: Take all VH's!
