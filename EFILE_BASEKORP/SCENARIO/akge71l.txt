Herr Feldmarshall, I am at a loss for words.  Your failure is...  incomprehensible. You have left us no choice but to come to terms with the Americans. This debacle will be remembered as one of the worst military disasters of our nation.  It is better for you that you will never return to the fatherland.  Much better.
