Ironically, the real winner of this battle between Germany and Russia is...France. Due to the Brussilow offensive and the British operation at the Somme we've been forced to retire too many troops from Verdun, and our plan there has failed. The French Army is shaken, but not broken, and our losses in the west have been so high that we'll have to retire to a safer defence line as soon as we can build it.

The Russians have achieved nothing. They've taken many territories, but they've lost so many soldiers and equipment that I doubt they'll be able to keep them for a long time. They've exhausted their last reserves, so from now on I think that they won't suppose a real threat to us. Paradoxically, France and Russia could have switched their destinies.

However, one unexpected fact could change everything. We know that, blinded by what they perceive as a stunning Russian victory, Romania will enter the war very soon, siding with the Entente. The Romanian Army, although antiquated and poorly equipped, is very large, and it could alter the balance of power in the Balkans. You'll have to go there and make sure it doesn't happen.
