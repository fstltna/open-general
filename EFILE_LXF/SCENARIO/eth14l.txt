LOSS

Of course the war in East Africa was not over.  There would continue to be heroic, comic, and tragic episodes before the last Italian surrendered and political intrigue galore before the Emperor's position was totally secured. But there was no longer any chance of an Italian victory or any real doubt of Haile Selassie's eventual success.  The tension of the history was gone.

So 5 May 1941, the day of the Emperor's return to his capital was amidst enormous enthusiasm.  It was precisely five years to the day after he had fled from it.  This seems as suitable a moment as any to ring down the curtain.

The End.
