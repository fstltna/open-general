Operation Luettich - August 1944

Our new operation to break the Allied offensive by driving to Avranches and destroying their forces has started on time, but with fewer troops than expected. Both the 116 (PzLehr) and the 1SS (LSSAH) have problems reaching the front. The attack has started with the 2Pz in the North and our division reinforced with a KG of the 17SS (Goetz von Berlichingen) in the South. Opposite us is the US 30ID which is putting up a stubborn defense.
