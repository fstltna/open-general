Manchurian Operation
The war in Europe is over. Now we had to keep our promise and built a second front against Japan in Asia. We could push forward and are now east of Changchun. Your troops should break through the lines of Japanese and Manchukuo troops in the east of the town and capture Changchun.
Your troops:
For this attack you will only have your tank army. We own no airfield in this area. So, you should have a can build unit for this mission in your troops.
Enemy troops: 
You are facing two armies and some Manchukuo troops. These armies are bad equipped but they have entrenched themselves in the mountains east of Changchun. To break through the lines will take time.
