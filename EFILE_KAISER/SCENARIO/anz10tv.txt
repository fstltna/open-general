Brief to Anzac Commander.

Your failure here has enabled the Turks to hold Palistine and force us back into Egypt. British troops will try to finish the job here. The High Command is very dissappointed and have ordered your troops to the bloodbath on the Western Front. I hope you are more sucessful there!!!
