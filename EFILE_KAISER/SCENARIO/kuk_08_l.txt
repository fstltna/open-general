I know you've tried, General, but you have to admit that the war is affecting you. A couple of years ago you'd have had no problems in defeating the Italians in Albania. Now, you've been incapable of winning this battle. It's time for you to retire. Take this not as an order, but as an advice from an old friend. You've done great things for the Empire. Now it's time for you to help in the reserve.
