Dogali - Jan 26th, 1887

"Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown"
Rev. 3, 11

The Italians were really fast at colonizing the coast of the Red Sea and, as soon as they could, they advanced into the mainland, too. After a few months, the Ethiopians had to decide if they would retreat, or if they would fight.

Ras Alula chose the latter, and attacked the Italian fort of Saati, to no avail. Our warriors still lacked the equipment needed for an assault on fortified positions. But the defenders of Saati had nearly run out of ammunitions and other supplies, so they asked for a relief column to be sent from Massawa.

The next day the Italian column left Massawa, led by Lt. Col. De Cristoforis. When the Italians were near Dogali, they were spotted by our scouts, and Ras Alula ordered me to attack them.

Victory conditions: 
- Destroy the 10 Italian units.
- If a single enemy unit manages to reach the EH at (2,14), you will lose.
