Herr General,

Sadly sixth army and the Caucasus army were not able to hold on to the eastern Don bend. Mussolini will be glad that you saved his obsolete 8th army, but for the strategic situation this won't matter:

Unfortunately, to the north of your forces, the Russians have broken through the lines and destroyed the Hungarian second army. We have no choice but to retreat to the Donetz.

You seem to be very talented in working with our allies. You will go to Bucharest and Rome to pick up some medals, your troops will go to Italy to assure us of Italian loyalty, and to prepare its defence.
