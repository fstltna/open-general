A glorious victory, Herr Feldmarschall!  The Bolsheviks have surrendered unconditionally!  We will require the independence of Bylorussia and the Ukraine under German protection, which will stabilize our Eastern borders.  We are about to sign a peace treaty with the English and Americans which will involve our withdrawal from England and France (we keep Alsace-Lorraine).  Now we will have the peace necessary to develop the Fatherland to its full potential. 

You are to return home to a grateful nation!
