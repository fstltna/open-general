(At Sedan) 
Intelligence indicates that the enemy currently has only second tier units defending this section of the river; force a crossing quickly before they can be reinforced!


[Designer note: This scenario focuses solely on General der Panzertruppen Heinz Guderian's XIX AK(mot.)'s crossing of the Meuse and subsequent wheel westwards. All other units and their engagements that were occuring on other parts of the map have been omitted (on May 15th 6.Pz crossed the Meuse just off-map at MonthermÈ advancing on Liart; 8.Pz crossed the river at Nouzonville).]
