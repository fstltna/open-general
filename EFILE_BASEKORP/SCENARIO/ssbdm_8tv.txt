"Blimey mate,where's She at now".The Spitfire was running."Horace,to Your left,no right,Hell She's got behind You again"."Dam,where these Bitches get this experience at to stay with Me.For Christs sake I've done had over 20 skirmishes in the sky and I can't shake this one off Me tail"."Bring Her around in front of Me and I'll flame Her for You Horace"."Alright Burt,to the left.Here We go".The Spit went,the SS followed,Burt intervened.The results SS Frau 'Lissa Hartmann of JG/52 took a few shells in Her wing and Fuselage,Horace and His Spit went down in flames and a barrel-roll by the FW-106 had Burton now running in His Hurricane.A few minutes later and SS Hartmann was off to find another advesary to battle as Burt was falling gently towards Mother Earth watching His plane tumble to it's destruction. Once on the ground Burt was greeted by some farmers watching the Air war."Who's winning up there" a old man asked as more gathered to watch."It aint Us, these Dam Nazi Girls are whipping Our asses Good" Burt replied.Later a Major saw Burton Gnomes,RAF Squadron 6 and picked Him up in His car,ran Him back to an airfield.Burt was hoping to get in another fighter but at this base the only planes were the ones destroyed on the ground,all others had been moved back towards Pari.So the SS/BdM had gained control in the area as the Brits on their isle held on to their Fighters for 'The Sake of Merry Ole England'.
