SITUATION:

Herr General, we have underestimated the Bolsheviks' powers of resistance. They have crossed the Don and completely encircled Sixth Army. You must support our Romanian ally, stop the Soviets and drive on Kletskaya and Serafimov to reestablish contact. We will never, never surrender to the Red Army, but in order for us to hold our position, you must prevail. Good Luck.

ORDERS: 

Hold 5/3/2 VHs after 12 turns for a BV/V/TV.

You need to launch an counterattack and capture the 5th VH at Serafimov for a BV.

NOTES:

AI will have the first turn!
