Good Morning General

H.Q. has decided it is time for your men to sharpen their skills, and regain some confidence. You and your men have been slated to take part in a training exercise code named "Operation Spartan". This exercise will involve ground forces only. A large area  west of London has been cleared to provide the "Battlefield". Your men, along with the Free French forces, will be known as "Force Z" and will attempt to secure a bridgehead at Egham and capture Camberly, forcing, and clearing the way for, a breakout. Opposing you will be the British and U.S. forces, to be known as "Force X". This is a "live" ammo exercise, so be careful!
Good luck, General....
