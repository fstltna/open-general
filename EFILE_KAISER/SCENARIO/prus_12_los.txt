Between the German pressure and the extremely cold weather, the Army of the Loire was forced to retreat, although it had had the victory at hand. Most of the survivors went to the east and tried to lift the siege of Belfort, but two French Army Corps escaped to Le Mans, in the west. The Prussians soon chased them.

However, the Kaiser and Bismarck weren't satisfied. The war was becoming too long and expensive. Even worse, many German soldiers were falling victims to tuberculosis and other contagious diseases, and some European powers were starting to see Prussia in a very unfavourable light. They had to force France to surrender in just a few weeks, or else Prussia and her allies would face a most unpredictable future.

Besides, on December 10th the constituents of the North German Confederation agreed to become a German Empire, giving the title of German Emperor to Wilhelm I, the Kaiser of Prussia. Naturally, the priority of the new emperor was winning the war at all costs.

For those reasons, as soon as the new Prussian Krupp siege guns arrived in Paris, the bombardment of the city began. Initially, only the defence forts were shelled, but after some days some of the Parisian quarters were attacked, too. Hundreds of civilians were killed or wounded.
