Rava Russka, 9 Sept 1914
Gospodin General-Major, as the Galician battle of maneuver unfolded, the Austrian 4th Army found itself in a corner.  With our 5th Army (V,XVII, and XII Corps) marching through Tomashov, the threat concentrated to the north.  Our 3rd Army (XI, IX, and X) began preparations for an attack from the east against the town of Rava Russka.

It appears that the Austrians are cut off from their neighbors with only a line of communication to the rear.  They are attempting to concentrate their forces against one flank and then the other.  You must press on with exhausted troops to foil the Austrian maneuver.  Expect the arrival of the 3rd Army to assault Rava Russka within days.
