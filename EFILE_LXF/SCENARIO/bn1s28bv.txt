General Kurt Student

Famous General! Mogadishu is in our hand and the remainders of the allied troops capitulated. The war is won and that we have to owe to a good piece you and your men's. You are expected in Berlin, you have the honour to lead the victory parade.

Thanks for playing the GREEN DEVILS! I hope you enjoyed the campaign and maybe we will see each other again here, or in another of my campaigns.
