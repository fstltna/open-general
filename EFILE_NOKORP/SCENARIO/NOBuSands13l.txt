Aw, that was unfortunate. Seems like it took us too much time to get here and now the British are too strong.
Unfortunately the Russian front is much more important than blocking the Suez canal, so we can't give you more troops. You'll have to do your best with what you have.

Rest and repair, and try to think of something. The British are weakened, but not as much as we are.
