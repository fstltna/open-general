Come in General! A toast of mulled wine!

Your troops fought well, but this offensive seemed doomed before it began.

4th Panzer Army never made contact with 6th Army and  now we get reports of another Soviet offensive against our own 8th Army.

Manstein had reportedly flown to Berlin to confer directly with Hilter on the reality of the situation, Madness!  Yet, that apparently did not help.

Hitler himself ordered all non-German forces to withdraw from front line duty...leaving the front in more chaos then ever.

Our troops are in bad shape.....I suggest we use this and the growing communist partisan activity in Yugoslavia as excuse to withdraw our troops from Russia.
