Spring has come. Enough lounging around!

The Russians have started a massive spring offensive, and you're the one who is going to stop them before they reach Moscow.
Stop them and counter-attack: It's time we take back the initiative and finish this unfinished business!

The best place to stop and annihilate the Russian offensive is a small town at a river crossing east of Moscow. Right now that crossing is only defended by a inexperienced Reserve regiment of ours, so get moving! If the Russians cross that river and capture that town, they will be unstoppable!



Instructions: Capture all VHs.
