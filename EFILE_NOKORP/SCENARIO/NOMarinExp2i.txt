As you know our ships have always had a problem reaching the Atlantic: The British control the Channel. The only way left for us is to go north, around the British isles, but now the British are also stationed in Island, attacking our ships and U-Boats no matter how far north they sail. This can't go on! Island needs to come under our control before the British fortify it.

You are to secure a beachhead for our invasion force. The Invasion Force will arrive in two weeks, by then you have to have taken control of that bay and the port. Our fleet will do its best to keep any British ships from interferring, but stay alert, some might slip through.

For this reason we have decided to award you with a brand new ship you will find eminently useful: "Freya" is a light cruiser with a carrier capacity. This ship can fight like a cruiser, and it also carries planes. You also get a couple of support vessels, for repairing and resupplying your ships: You're a long way from the next friendly shipyard.
Last but not least, we have temporarily detached the Admiral Graf Spee for this mission, you might need it. Take great care of her though - Lose us the Admiral Graf Spee and your military career is finished.


Instructions: Take all VHs, don't lose the Admiral Graf Spee.
Enjoy your new light cruiser-carrier ("Flugdeckkreuzer Freya"), she comes with a bonus free fighter and a bonus free scout plane. You also get a repair ship and a supply ship for free. All those five units are core units you get to keep.
