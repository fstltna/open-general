Well, General, it's great to wave good-bye to this blood-stained stretch of land, isn't it? The heat, the flies, the smell of rotting corpses - I am sure the horrible images of Gallipoli will still haunt our dreams for some time. Fortunately, this campaign is over - but the war goes on...

HISTORICAL OUTCOME:
By 7 January , the British troops had already been reduced to 19,000. The Turks were well aware of the forthcoming evacuation and mounted a last attack by their XIV Corps under cover of the heaviest bombardment of the campaign. The attack failed almost before it had begun. Many Turks simply refused to advance, as if, after months of heroism, their will had finally given out.
On the night of 8/9 January the last troops withdrew along arranged routes, in complete silence. At dawn, when the ammunition-dumps blew up, there was no man left ashore, and not a casualty had been sustained. The evacuation of Gallipoli was a triumph, closing a campaign of incompetence.
