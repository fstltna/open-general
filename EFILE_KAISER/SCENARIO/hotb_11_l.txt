General, what happened to you? After all of your excellent past performances, it seems that you've reached your limit. Our offensive has been a failure, the Germans have retreated in good order, and we've suffered tens of thousands of casualties. It's time for you to retire. We need a younger commander who fully understands the new weapons and the warfare strategies of the future.
