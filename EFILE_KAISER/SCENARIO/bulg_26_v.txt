With your masterful guidance, everything has gone as planned. In a few hours our diplomats will meet in Solun with an Entente delegation in order to discuss an honorable peace for both sides.

However, I'm afraid that such conditions will be quite hard. We'll have to leave Solun and Vardar Macedonia, but at least we'll keep Southern Dobrudzha, Western Thrace and part of Aegean Macedonia, including the town of Ser. It may seem a small reward after so many sacrifices, but our fate will be much better than that of our allies.

In the next years we'll have to put our efforts in recovering from these terrible six years of war. And we'll have an eye on our neighbours, too. Greece and Turkey still have an unfinished feud, and Serbia may find out that controlling the Croats and Macedonians isn't as easy as they had thought. If they ever get into trouble, we'll be there to take advantage of the situation. We'll learn to patient but, some day, they'll give us all that's rightfully ours.

The campaign is over. I hope you've liked it, and thanks for playing.
