Romani, 3rd August 1916
----------------------------------------
General von Kressenstein, the German director of last year's vain Turco-German attack on the Suez Canal, has prepared a more formidable movement of invasion across the Sinai Desert. Instead of attempting a surprise attack across the centre of the Sinai wastes, the German commander has made a well-heralded movement along the ancient caravan track by the Mediterranean shore.

The Turks, supported by the German "Pascha I" detachment and some Austrian mountain howitzer batteries, have brushed aside and scattered British cavalry and infantry formations that tried to bar their advance. The situation is getting serious, since Kressenstein's troops have already reached the oasis of Katia.

To meet the threat to the canal and Egypt, we must prepare to halt the rolling Turkish juggernaut.  At the moment some Australian Light Horse regiments have occupied a position about seven miles west of Katia, and about eighteen miles east of Port Said. From the coast our entrenchments curve towards the oasis of Romani, and the new desert railway station near by. You and your men are ordered to reinforce our Australian comrades and repulse the expected Turkish attack. Good luck, General!
