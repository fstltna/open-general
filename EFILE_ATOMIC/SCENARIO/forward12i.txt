Rzhew Meat Grinder
After our offensive in the winter there is still the German salient at Rzhew. We have decided to start a great attack on the salient with the target of destroying the defendsing German troops. Your troops should attack in the north at Rzhew, in the south at Sychewka and in the middle of the salient, break through the lines and destroy or capture the most forces.
Your troops:
You will have the command over the 30. Army. The Germans hold the only airfield in this area, but the 30. Army has a very experienced engineer troop, which has many experience in buliding airfields.
Enemy troops:
You are facing the 9. German Army. The troops in the salient are still very strong. They have built a coherent front line and break through it could be very difficult but they have no reserves after the first front line. The area is also full of landmines and fortifications. Rzhew`s defenders are very powerfull, you may need a lot of higher range artillery to break through the lines at Rzhew. Be aware, that the reserve troops are deployed in Sychewka. There you have to calculate with heavy resistance, too.
Please notice:
You will gain 100 pp per turn.This money is for refits and you will be over the cap if you do not use it, so feel free to use it.
