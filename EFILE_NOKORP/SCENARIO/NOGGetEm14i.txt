Boss Fight!!!
This is the final showdown, your army, fine-tuned for this last battle, against Ordrac's toughest units, including a feared "Boss tank (vorpal)"a tank compared to which those Nightmare tanks Mk.II fight like little girls. Luckily for you, it is unique.

To win you need either to destroy Ordrac's two Must-Survive-Units, or capture all Victory Hexes. The second choice is long and tedious, but allows you to avoid having to battle the Boss tank. Use this option if for some inexplicable reason you haven't brought the tools to fight hard-hitting, very-long-range units with very high armor...


Hint: This is the final battle, and your adversaries will be (very) heavy tanks, long range artillery and ground attack planes. Reconfigure your army accordingly, some types of units might be useless, whereas at this point your tanks and Anti-tank weapons need to be top-notch. You'll get some extreme long range railroad artillery to help you with the fortifications; It's only problem is that, unless you find a way to lay additional railroad tracks, it will only go half the way, so keep some long-range, Bonus bunker busting artillery handy.
