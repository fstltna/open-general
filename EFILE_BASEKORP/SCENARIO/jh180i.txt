Herr General.  Our Finnish allies wish to reclaim the territory they lost to the Bolsheviks in 1940.  You and your brave men will assist them in this, thus preparing the way for the seizure of Leningrad.  Your offensive here will also divert some of the Bolshevik's attention from Feldmarschall Manstein's Army Group Center.
