FORTRESS AT BARDIA January 03 1941

Graziani wanted to give up the Cirenaica, but Comando Supremo ordered him to be more optimistic. He split 10th Army in 3 defensive groups: your division and the rest of XXIII Corps in Bardia, XXII Corps in Tobruk and XX Corps holding the Mechili-Derna line.

Intelligence reports that the 4th Indian division has been redrawn from the front lines and the 6th 'Diggers' Australian division has taken its place.

The attack on Bardia is imminent, but our 4 divisions should be able to repulse the enemy.

Note: Hold on to each of Bardia's defensive positions for as long as possible. A fast enemy advance will demoralize your troops and will lead to a Loss. Do not give up Post 32 (22,21) and the positions surrounding it until after the BV turn limit has passed. Do not give up the positions around hexes (24,16) or (27,7) until after the V turn limit has passed.

Please move the General Bergonzoli unit in the last turn to escape from Bardia and win the scenario.
