That was a close one! Thank God you have managed.

This is bound to happen again, our troops are stretched too thin to control this huge territory. High Command is worrying your troops might get surrounded and cut off, and you are way too far east for our failing supply lines to reach you. Short version, you can't stay there.

Use whatever fuel you have to retreat to Moscow immediately, before you get cut off. You will spend the winter in Moscow, defending it from any attack.
