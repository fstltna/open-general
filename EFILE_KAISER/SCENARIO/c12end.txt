Comrade, this is one of the finest bottles of vodka!  Something that Wrangel wanted to take with him in his escape.  Though Wrangel has escaped, something historical has happened, comrade.  The Revolution of the proletariat in Russia has succeeded!  For the first time in history, the socialists of the people will rule themselves!  No more tyranny, no more social classes!  We will all be equal!  A dream has come alive, comrade!
