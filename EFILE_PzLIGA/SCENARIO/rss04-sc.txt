Assault on Vladivostok

August, 1944

Take my binoculars... did you see them?, yes... it's the bolshevik naval base of Vladivostok. We didn't expect those naval forces of the Pacific Soviet fleet, it's seem they have escaped from their defeat at the battle in the Kuril Islands... Our infiltrated anti-bolshevik agents have reported us the soviets still have some important units in the encirclement of the besieged city, with orders from Moscow to resist until the last man. The NKVD police units will try to force that slogan on the population of Vladivostok, from which they have recruited two divisions.

Your mission is clear general, crush the bolshevik resistance here and end with the Russian power in the Pacific and with this war, for once and forever. After this battle, we are sure the Soviets will sign the armistice, the war will end, and Japan will be the main power in the world...
