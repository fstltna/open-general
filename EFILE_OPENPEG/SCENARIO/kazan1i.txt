Kazan, Russia
As the primary means of transport between European and Asian Russia, the Trans-Siberian Railroad is the critical link in all of our operations against the People’s Republic of China. The Chinese are mobilizing additional forces to protect their hold on it. You must move quickly to take Kazan before they cross the Urals. From there, you must capture supply points south along the Trans-Siberian Railroad and secure the waterways down the length of the Volga.
