
ALEXANDRIA - 11 MAY 1941

West of Alexandria, Egypt

The Commonwealth forces in Egypt are as good as defeated, the evacuation of Alexandria is in progress and according to information of our intelligence, the Mediterranean fleet has already set sail and fled via Suez Canal toward the Indian Ocean. However, some units of the French fleet are interned in Alexandria - and these units should be located still there. It is clear that the enemy is not willing to let these ships fall into our hands. Occupy Alexandria and try your best to prevent the scuttling of the French ships!

GOAL: Take all VH's and prevent that more than 4 ships are sunk!
