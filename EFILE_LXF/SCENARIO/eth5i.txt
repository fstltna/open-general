BATTLE OF ENDERTA

February 10th, 1936 (Enderta Region, Tigray Province, Northern Ethiopia)

Six miles long and two to three miles wide, Amba Aradam rose high above the surrounding countryside, facing Makalle and blocking any possible move south. It was a real "amba", flat-topped, covered with crevices and canyons and caves, impregnable on the north-east where the Tug Gabat ran round its flanks through precipitous ravines.

For five weeks Ras Mulugueta had been encamped with his Mahel Safari on this mountain. Ras Mulugueta's 70-80,000 men were on Amba Aradam top, half spread out around its flanks. He had machine-guns, cannons, and a few anti-aircraft guns. Behind him the plains of Mahera were alive with the cattle gathered en route and herded up to feed his vast army.

On 5 February the Emperor ordered the Bitwoded Makonnen's 12,000 well-armed men, the army of Wollega, and the most modern in the North to move forward from Quoram as reinforcements.

On Sunday 9 February Badoglio called forward the journalists from Asmara to Makelle and held a confident, almost boastful press conference. On Monday 10 February four divisions began moving forward before dawn. Badoglio's plan was simple enough; not to attack Amba Aradam frontally, an impossible task, but to carry out a DOUBLE ENCIRCLING MOVEMENT.
