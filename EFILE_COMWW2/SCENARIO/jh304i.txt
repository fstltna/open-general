Thermopylae
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Ah, Herr General, I hope you have enjoyed your leave.  As you know, British and Commonwealth  troops have occupied the historic pass at Thermopylae.  You must secure this pass and prevent the escape of the enemy.  The terrain is rugged and difficult for maneuver.   You must act decisively. These troops were bypassed in our initial Grecian campaign, but now is the time to eliminate this threat to our control of the area.
