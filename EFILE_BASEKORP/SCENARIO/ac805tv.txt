Herr General!

The fresh air from the channel is wonderful yah?  It is good to finally look upon the water.

We thank you and your troops for there efforts during this campaign, the Allies can be quite stubborn, but at least we prevented the French from escaping, no?

Good friends of mine have word that you are to lead the final assault on Greece.  Enjoy the mediteranian air during your next mission.
