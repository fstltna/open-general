Herr General,
Dietrich's Leibstandarte has launched an attack towards the Wattenberg heights to destroy Allied artillery there. OKW is far from pleased but has ordered you to move 2nd Panzer Division up in support of this reckless action.

XIX Corps Battleplan:-

1. Locate the Leibstandarte.

2. Support their action where-ever possible.

Player Note: Only 7 land based units can be deployed this scenario.
Recomended purchase:- Upgrades and overstrengthening.
Suggested Core:- 3x Tank, 1x Anti-Tank, 3x Infantry, 2x Recon, 2x Artillery, 1x Fighter, 1x Tac Bomber (Including Protos).

This scenario is originally part of the "Meine Ehre heisst Treue" campaign by Technique and has been used with his kind permission. 

Good luck.
