Tanks against Monsters?
Stranger and stranger!  :-D

Now you will get to fight Kaiju, Japanese giant monsters.
Think of it as a "Invasion of the Giant Monsters" B movie...

Beware, they are fast, they are tough (20 strength points), they pack a mean (deadly even) punch, and they can even hit planes, throwing stuff at them. Don't let them catch you, they'll slap you silly!

Given how easy you can lose a unit or ten, there are several terrain structures on the map you can try to seek shelter in (or behind). Though keep in mind that if you stay too long in one you will get surrounded. There are over half a dozen Kaiju out there, and facing them all at the same time might be suicide.
You'll have to find the best strategy.

You have two areas of deployment, depending if you prefer to be immediately mobile, or rather start protected by some rivers. Do Kaiju swim?... 
(Hint: Yes, of course they can cross normal rivers, but slowly.)

You also get (temporarily) a (mobile) watchtower. It will allow you to see the monsters coming...
