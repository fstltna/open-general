The First World War - Chunuk Bair - August 1915 - TV

Général, do you hear the voices of our men singing "La Madelon" reverberating from the hills?

"La servante est jeune et gentille,
Légère comme un papillon.
Comme son vin son oeil pétille,
Nous l'appelons la Madelon"

And there comes the answer of our dear comrades from "Down Under", a beautiful song as well, I must say. I have been told it is called "Waltzing Matilda". Oh well, Général, let the boys celebrate tonight. Tomorrow they will learn that all of our courage, all of our sacrifice has been in vain, since the British landing at Suvla Bay has been an utter failure. It is a disgrace, and I doubt it will raise the reputation of our ally among our men.


HISTORICAL EVENTS:

Historically, the French didn't join the ANZAC troops at Chunuk Bair. They remained at Cape Helles and took part in a diversionary attack on Krithia that can be at best be described as "insignificant". Meanwhile, wave after wave of ANZAC soldiers branded against the Turkish defences along the Sari Bair range. Some Australian battalions were almost annihilated at Lone Pine and The Nek, as was the Wellington Battalion of the New Zealand Brigade, which conquered the heights of Chunuk Bair. When Mustafa Kemal launched his counter-attack on August 10th, the allied troops finally were overwhelmed, and even the brave and stubborn Gurkhas that were the last to hold out on the upper ridge, were forced to retreat.
