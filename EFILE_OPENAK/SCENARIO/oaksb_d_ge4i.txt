Herr General, you must break through and encircle the enemy along the Polish frontier, exploiting their lack of mobility.  Speed is essential; a successful advance here will allow us to threaten Warsaw from the north and east simultaneously.  In addition, we can welcome our Soviet friends to the key city of Brest-Litovsk on the new German-Soviet border.  The General Staff will not be pleased if it is the Soviets who welcome us instead.

It is suggested that you pay careful attention to the Polish cavalry.  They are still among the best trained and equipped units of the Polish army.  They are acting as reconnaissance units, but are a force to be reckoned with in their own right.
