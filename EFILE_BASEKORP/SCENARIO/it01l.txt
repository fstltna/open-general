ON TO SIDI BARRANI September 1940 L

This advance is pushing our organisational talents to the limit. We told Mussolini this invasion is doomed to fail, and look what has happened. Our attack has stalled completely. 

HISTORY
The British retreated to buy time and reinforcements. After 4 days and 60 miles inside Egypt, Graziani stops his attack due to supply logistics. To risk going any farther, Graziani said, would risk being defeated until supplies were available. Promised reinforcements were diverted to Greece and Graziani was forced to change his attack plan and could not penetrate deeper than Sidi Barrani.
