Well, I'll be damned.  It's never the fucking Reds, is it?

Commander, we've got something on our hands the likes of which has never been seen before.  Obviously whoever made this thing and the sentry craft protecting it has technology way beyond that of our own.  Thank god they've never heard of the idea of armor on a combat vehicle.

The device is being shipped back to the States on the largest civilian boat we can find.  Meanwhile, you should plot your next move, Commander.  I'll let you know what happens with this as more developments come up.

Carter out.
