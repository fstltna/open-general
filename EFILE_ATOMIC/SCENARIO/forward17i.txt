Choice Scenario
We want avoid large troop movements for our big offensives, so we have decided that an army stays in the region, whrere it is deployed. You have to come to a decision, where you want to fight. You have three options:
You can fight against the Heeresgruppe North:
This is the easiest and shortest path. You will attack the Germans at Leningrad and will follow them to Courland.
You can fight against the Heeresgruppe Mitte:
This can be tough, because you will have the option to fight against west allied troops. Otherwise this path will lead you to Berlin.
You can fight against the Heeresgruppe South:
This path contains several scenarios. You will first attack the Kuban-Bridgehead and push the Germans through Romania and Hungary to Prague, where this path will end.
Please notice: After the battles in Europe two of the three paths will have an additional scenario in asia.
What is your choice?
