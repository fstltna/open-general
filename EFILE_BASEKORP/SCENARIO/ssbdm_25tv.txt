" Keegee,how's it going up there"."The Soviets are throwing everything they got.The vacancies where the 36th SS was is under constant attack.We've been bombing the Hell out of them at the Point of intrusion but now all Stukas have been given a different assignment to attack the rear where the supplies are.And all of Us know what that means,tons of AA to try and knock Us down.'Phenom's Heavy Kondor Gruppen is suppose to go in before Us to aid but that hasn't worked before so I may not be flying this Stuka with Grott tomorrow and We both will be lucky to see tomorrow".Keegee's Stuka was shot down as a lot of others.Phenom's Kondors attacked 3 times taking good losses too.Finally SS Air Korps released 5 other Kondor Gruppen and a JU-88 Gruppen and the Soviet rear was destroyed.Soviet Armor continued it's attack for 2 days but short on fuel had to curtail actions and then was destroyed by the 34th SS Panzer and 'Vell's SS Panzer Gruppe with aid of Stukas as most Soviet tanks retreated.The Fuhress flew to the Front to see SS Gen Renveldt."I told You Ilse,look at the numbers We lost.Yes We held this time.If You don't get some Armor here We are in trouble.And with Winter coming the Air Korps will be worthless. We will be overrun"." Come with Me Renveldt".A trip to the Rail Station." There Renveldt,there's Your Armor".Stu IIIG's had arrived.
