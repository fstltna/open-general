Capture Leningrad
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
With von Paulus's breakout from Stalingrad in conjunction with the offensive of Manstein's Army Group Center the Bolsheviks are retreating in Central Russia.  At the same time the Finnish army has been recovering lost territory north of Leningrad, which has given us the opportunity to capture Leningrad. 

However our intelligence report that the Soviets are trying to break the encirclement, so expect Soviet counterattacks both from the south and the northeast.

Good luck Herr General
