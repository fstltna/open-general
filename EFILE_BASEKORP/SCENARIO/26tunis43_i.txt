26 Tunis 43

Herr General
Our situation in northern Africa is critical. Allies destroy our supply fleet and have entire air superiority. We need to abandon Africa and take the fight back to Europe.
Hold Tunis and flank the Allies via Beja and drive to Bizerte to give them one last bloody nose before we leave.
