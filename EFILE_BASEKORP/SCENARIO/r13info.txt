13. ORDZHONIKIDZE 2 (8 November 1942)

Of all sectors of the front, from Leningrad to Moscow and to Stalingrad, just here at Ordzhonikidze, we have the iniative, comrade. You have saved Ordzhonikidze from an immediately enemy invasion and cut off the supply lines for the fascist forces at Ordzhonikidze. However, as usual the enemy is persistant, we are sure the Germans have send reinforcements to restore the lines with the trapped Germans. It is likely that the encircled forces will participate in the breakout. If these forces join, then we are likely to lose Ordzhonikidze after all. You must make sure this does not happen by destroying the encircled enemy force and to drive west, away from Ordzhonikidze!

NOTE: There are various SNOW hexes on the map. These have the same properties as SAND hexes in the desert. Supplying and reinforcing units on those hexes will never be a 100%.
