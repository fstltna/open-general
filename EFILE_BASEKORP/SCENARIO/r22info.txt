22. JASSY (15 June 1944)

Since our spring offensives we have a bridgehead into Rumania over the Prut River, near Jassy.  The fascists have taken blow after blow but somehow have regained their spirit. We are convinced the enemy has concentrated a huge force to eliminate our bridgehead. We must hold it. It is an ideal starting point for the invasion of Rumania which is plannend within some months. 

Our forces in the Jassy bridgehead are problaby outnumbered and lack supplies and manpower at the moment. The Germans are depending on the worn out Rumanians to have sufficient manpower. They will try to eliminate our bridgehead as long as this situation continues. You are ordered to hold the bridgehead and repel any fascist counterattack. You are permitted to withdraw to a smaller perimeter but in the end we must have a position on the other side of the Prut River! Watch out for the enemy Panther and Tiger tanks. Good luck, comrade!
