KIEV COUNTEROFFENSIVE (9 June 1920)

The Revolution is on its way to the West!  Comrade, a major offensive by our armies north and south of Kiev has pushed back the Polish bandits.  Even blind people can see that Kiev is about to fall.  Or better said, given back to the people of Kiev!

Your Cavalry Army has taken part of the push south of Kiev and is now in excellent position to cut off the capitalist's troops still in Kiev.  The Twelfth Army is approaching Kiev from the east.  The Polish criminals have no respect for the property of the Kiev people and are likely to demolish the bridges and perhaps even more!  You are ordered to liberate Kiev, and join up with Twelfth Army and advance as far as you can to the west!
