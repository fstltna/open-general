Antwerp - The Third Battle - September 27th 1914

The destruction of the Belgian Army - that sits in Antwerp and keeps on threatening the supply lines to our troops in France - has become a priority. Von Beseler has received more troops to reach this goal. On top of the III Reserve Corps with the 5th and 6th Reserve Divisions, also the Marine Division , the 4th Ersatz Division, the 26th, 37th, 38th and 41st Landwehr Brigaden and the 1st and 2nd Reserve Ersatz Brigaden are now under his command.

With Liege, Namur and Maubeuge in our hands, the 24th and 25th Pio Rgts and 120 pieces of siege artillery are freed up for the siege of Antwerp.

Von Beseler has decided to attack the fortress ring around Antwerp from the South West, in the sector between the rivers Dijle and Grote Nete.

Rumors have it that the British First Lord of Admirality, Winston Churchill, is on its way to Antwerp with a Brigade of Marines, two Brigades of Naval Infantry and some heavy 4,7inch and 6inch guns which the Belgians are preparing to mount on their armored trains. 

You can win this scenario by either capturing the six fortresses on the map and the cities of Lier and Mechelen, or by exiting 6 units in the NW corner of the map. These six units enter the city of Antwerp, which is sufficient to make the Belgian Army give up the city.
