Herr General, you must break through and encircle the enemy along the Polish frontier, exploiting their lack of mobility.  We will send pre-emptive strikes to destroy the Polish air force, therefore no aircraft will impede your advance.  Speed is essential; a successful advance here will allow us to threaten Warsaw from the north and east simultaneously.  In addition, we can welcome our Soviet friends to the key city of Brest-Litovsk on the new German-Soviet border.  The General Staff will not be pleased if it is the Soviets who welcome us instead.
