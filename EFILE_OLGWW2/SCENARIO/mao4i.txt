Long March - Luding Bridge

29-5-1935, Luding, Sichuan, Central China.

Welcome again commander.  We have escaped from Jingghanshan in our long march to the North.  Today the Dadu River lies in front of us, and your task is to cross that river.  The problem is, we have in front the city of Luding, which is in the hands of the local pro-KMT Warlord Liu Wenhui.  I see the chains bridge over the Dadu River is on fire, but our long march can't be stopped!  Go ahead soldier!

[Historically the crossing of the Dadu River by the chains bridge on fire is just a legend.  During the 80's, some PRC sources admitted the ChCP troops crossed the bridge without too many problems because the local warlord willingness of fight was not very high... like most other warlords.]
