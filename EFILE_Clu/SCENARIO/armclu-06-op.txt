Struggle For The Bridgeheads - Kienitz

02/05/1945

The first units of the 1st Byelorussian Front crossed the ice of the Oder at 0600 hours on January 31st and took the village of Kienitz by surprise. During the next few days the Soviets widened the bridgehead by forcing some other river crossings. For the Soviets it was essential to establish bridgeheads on the west bank of the Oder before the Germans could defend that natural obstacle. Immediately the Germans threw in some Ad Hoc Battailons to close the frontline and prepared the 25th Panzergrenadierdivision for a counter attack. The Soviets got ready for fierce resistance but couldn't field tanks and heavy weapons because of an early thaw that caused the ice of the Oder to break and prevented the crossing of heavy amor.

New units have strength 8 and experience 75. To reach all goals will be nearly impossible (historically correct). A loss is no shame here (you will be sent to the next scen anyway).
