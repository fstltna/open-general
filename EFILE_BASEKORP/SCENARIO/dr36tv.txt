Steel Hussars - March 1945 - TV

Congratulations General. After last year's disastrous Summer on the Eastern Front, you have stabilized the situation in the Winter, bringing  the Soviet steamroller to a standstill. Your division will be transported to the Western front to protect the Ruhr area from British and US forces that have reached the Rhein.
