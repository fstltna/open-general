General!

Our successful encirclement at Smolensk trapped most of two armies!

Your troops screened the flanks of my Panzerkorps good enough that the main thrust surged forward at good speed! Your forces on the right fought valiantly against the hordes that pressed in to stop us and stopped them.

Bravo to you and your men!
