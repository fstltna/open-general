Fall Rot - Operation Kleiner Baer at Altkirch 

The British Expeditionary Force has been evacuated from the mainland at Dunkirk. The best divisions of the French Army have surrendered or are in disarray and on the run. Our Panzers are in pursuit heading South. Your forces are ordered to take part in mopping up the Maginot line - a complex of fortifications along the German-French border. You will attack the fortresses from the rear while 2 infantry divisions of the 7th Armee / Armee Gruppe C get the difficult task of attacking the fortresses head-on. Orders are to capture the command posts of the 2 big fortresses in the area. Das Oberkommando has asked you to prevent French troops from fleeing into Switzerland.
