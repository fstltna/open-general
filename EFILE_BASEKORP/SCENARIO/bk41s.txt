Herr General, sit down please. We are giving your troops a very special mission.  We have convinced the Furher that they must capture the factories the French have on the coast before they can be destroyed.
We have information that the British will mount a counter-offensive with some mad Scot troops and their "invincible" Matilda tanks.
Prepare a welcome for them and when they have been smashed , advance rapidly to your objectives. The remaining French airforce will be supporting the attack.
