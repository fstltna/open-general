Ia Drang Valley

November, 1965

Following your recent successes, Headquarters in Hanoi wants to continue the struggle.  You will attack the advanced outposts of the Americans close to the limits of Cambodia. As you know comrade, the puppet capitalist government of Phnom Phem can't prevent us from using their soil to support our operations and that's what we are going to continue to do.

In the jungle our advanced agents have spotted a number of good landing zones made by heli-transported American troops as well as an artillery position to the SE. They probably are trying pay us back for the blow of the Plei Me attack or just cutting our routes to Cambodia. Nevertheless, your mission will be to give the Americans another decisive defeat. Maybe they will learn the price for staying in Vietnam. Reinforcements from our nearby Viet-Cong comrades will arrive though our jungle supplies routes with ammo and men to support your command.  

You must clear the enemy landing zones, at any cost.

Don't forget to watch your back.
