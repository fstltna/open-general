
OPERATION GYBSY BARON - 15 JUN 1943

HQ Soviet Partisans, Belarus
CO General Karotamm

That we have interrupted the supply routes for their offensive at Kursk, has not pleased the Germans. They'll try to force us out of this area. Resist their attack, and hold the railways unusable.

Order: Resist the German attack for 16 turns and hold as much VHs as possible!
