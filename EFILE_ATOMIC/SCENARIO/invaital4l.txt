That didn't work out as planned... 

Historical Info:

This was a semi-historic scenario which covered the allied advance, the german retreat across the Messina Strait as well as Operation Scylla, the breakthrough of Italian cruiser Scipione Africano and its fight with British MTBs of the 10th MTB flotilla. Scipione Africano's journey from its Base La Spezia in the Tyrrhenian Sea to Taranto, in the Ionian Sea, took place from 15th to 17th July. The naval engagement between the cruiser and the four MTBs took place in the eraly hours of 17th July.

The axis retreat across the Strait of Messina took place between 1st and 17th August and has to be considered a highly successful operation. The withdrawl of the axis forces was well ordered and so fast at times, that the allied forces couldn't keep up with the speed. Both sides of the Messina Strait were heavily defended by hundreds of anti-aircraft and coastal artillery guns, making it difficult for allied forces to attack.

On 3rd September the Allies launched Operation Baytown and the British XIII Corps crossed the Messina Strait from Sicily to Regio di Calabria. The Germans had pulled back their forces because the awaited the main force of the allies to make landfall somewhere in the north. Only one Regiment was left back to defent 17 miles of coast.
