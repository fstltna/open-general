Clu's Suomussalmi v.1.2

A military classic

There is no other battle of the winter war which is as exiting for the public as the battle of Suomussalmi. This campaign is even nowerdays practiced at military academies as a 'classic'. It's a example for it, what motivated and well-led troops with innovative tactics can achieve even against a much stronger opponent.

The battle was fought between the end of december 1939 and the begin of january 1940. The forest-covered terrain, cut by frozen lakes and rivers, is covered by one and a half meter of snow, the temperature falls below -40 degree Celsius and blizzards delay the soviet air force activities. The soviet 163.division is surrounded, cut of from supply and their Units are divided in certain encircled areas (Mottis).
The 44.division (mot.) suffers the same destiny.
Most of the two divisions are annihilated (at least 38.000 to 40.000 killed or died of privation).
The booty contains of 43 tanks, 50 field cannons, 25 AT's, 270 trucks , 300 machine guns and 6000 rifles.

Can you lead the Finns to a similar victory? Or will the soviets divide Finland in two parts?
