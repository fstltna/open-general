The First World War - The Race to the Sea - Oct. 1914 V

Général, you have prevented the Germans from enveloping our forces. The Race to the Sea continues, but it is clear that the ports of Calais and Dunkerque will stay out of German hands. 

HISTORICAL EVENTS:

The Race to the Sea took place from about 17 September to 19 October 1914, after the German advance into France had been stopped at the First Battle of the Marne and the subsequent First Battle of the Aisne - a Franco-British counter-offensive.

The "race" ended on the North Sea coast of Belgium around 19 October, when the last open area from Diksmuide to the North Sea was occupied by Belgian troops who had retreated after the Siege of Antwerp. The outflanking attempts had resulted in a number of encounter battles but neither side was able to gain a decisive victory.
