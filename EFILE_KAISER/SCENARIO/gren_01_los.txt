The courage and the quality of the Egyptian soldiers were beyond all doubt, and they were not surprised by our troops. However, with the arrival of our reserves we managed to overwhelm them. Urabi surrendered to our cavalry, and the next day Wolseley arrived in Cairo. The Khedive was reinstated, and we established a permanent British military garrison in Egypt for the protection of our nation's interests.

A few weeks later I was promoted to captain. Upon my return to England I could finally ask Colonel Worthington for the hand of Evelyn, and we married in Norwich on May 13th, 1883. She was determined to accompany me to Egypt when I rejoined my regiment and, knowing that nothing that I could say would make her change her mind, I didn't make any objections. Ten months after our wedding, Michael, our first son, was born in Alexandria. I was happier than ever before in my life, but at the same time the news about the Dervish rebellion in Sudan grew increasingly worrysome.
