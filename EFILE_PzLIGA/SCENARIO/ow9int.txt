After the victory in Lillehammer, the south of Norway is mostly over control. Your troops have reached the coast after accomplish all their objetives on the inland. Your mission now is to take Trondheim and all the nearby bases. OKH and OKW have reports that confirm the allied presence in the area. Troops and Kriegsmarine ships will help you from the sea, good luck.
