Suez Canal

November 22nd, 1942

After the fall of El Cairo and Port Said, the last point of British resistance in Egypt is the Suez Canal. The enemy have regrouped some units around Suez as a last chance to stop us. Intelligence reports say that the Americans are preparing an invasion of Nort Africa soon so you must finish with the British as soon as possible, to control the Suez Canal for a possible meeting with the Americans in the coming months.
