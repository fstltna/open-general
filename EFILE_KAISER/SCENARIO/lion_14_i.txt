Bure - Jun 20th, 1918

"The Lord is far from the wicked, but he hears the prayer of the righteous"
Prov. 15, 29

As you know, there weren't any important battles in the Gondar campaign. Both sides had good reasons for avoiding pitched battles, and for taking little risks. We chose a strategy of permanent guerrilla attacks, trying to harass the invaders as much as possible, to cut their supply lines, to slow their advances, and to lower their morale. Although we couldn't retake the lost territory, this new system seemed to work, as our enemies finally stopped their offensive.

However, the British had been much more cunning. As it turned out to be, the Gondar campaign was just a bait, as it had been the southern invasion by the African Rifles. The British were using expendable colonial troops in order to keep us busy and exhaust all our reserves of men and supplies, while they prepared their real attack. They called it Operation Solomon, and took us completely by surprise.

In May, two British divisions, composed exclusively of European and Indian troops, and with aerial and tank support, attacked Gojjam, and quickly overran the local defences. After a few days, they had already taken Bure, and it seemed that they'd reach Debre Markos soon. If that town fell, nothing would stop them until Addis Abeba, and the war would be lost.

I was ordered to go to Gojjam as soon as possible. The Empress sent her Imperial Guard as a reinforcement, and I could use the local guerrillas to harass the advancing British, but I knew that the upcoming battle was going to be very tough, maybe the toughest that I had ever fought.

Victory conditions: 
Take all the VHs.

Special notes:
- An infantry unit (Ethiopian Imperial Guards) has been added to your core.
- Your units with mountain movement can be extremely useful. Use them wisely.
