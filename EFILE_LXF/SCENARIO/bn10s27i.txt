
SVERDLOVSK - 19 SEP 1942

West of Sverdlovsk, Russia

It seems that the Russians are as good as defeated! Moscow has fallen, the Japanese have occupied Krasnoyarsk and a continuous front line exists no more in large parts! The Soviet leadership fled to Arkhangelsk in the north - this event is a sign that the enemy sees the areas behind the Ural as already lost and that organized resistance does not exist there. 2000 km are currently between the Japanese troops and us. Our aim is now to overcome this distance quickly.
Your next goal is city of Sverdlovsk, a transport and industrial center on the European-Asian border. We own no information about the strength of the defenders of the city, maybe it is possible you manage to capture the city in a surprise attack by the current chaos among the enemy ranks.

GOAL: Take all VH's!
