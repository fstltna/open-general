12/22/1939   Kelja And No End

Hello Tappi ('Shorty'), 
the Soviets have obviously planned a larger operation in the Kelja-area the next days. You have to ruin that.
Situation report: Our reconnaissance reports that the 4th Rifle division has been greatly strengthened and is on it's way to the deployment areas.
Enemy: Beside the mentioned 4th Rifle division there is also the 49th Rifle division. The Red air force may be very active again. For the time the Soviets will be without any fighter-protection and without unfavorable weather conditions.
Our forces: Your forces and the 10th Division.

Smash the soviet deployment and don't get caught. You must also hold Taipale (hex 17, 18)!
