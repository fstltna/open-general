THE MERSA BREGA POSITION December12 1942

Not until we reached the well defendable positions at Mersa Brega and El Agheila, we could finally dig in and bring the Allied advance to a stop... for now. Eight Army will soon have enough troops ready at the front to resume the attack. Make sure that when they do so, you don't get surrounded! But do not retreat too fast. Our next line of defense at Buerat is not ready yet.

Notes: 
- No more than three ground units can be deployed in this scenario: the Ariete battle group.
- Make sure that your troops keep the road to the West open by capturing the New Zealand VH in the West. I the mean time, delay the main Allied advance by not giving up the Mersa Brega position (most E victory hex) before the BV limit and not giving up El Agheila before the V limit.
