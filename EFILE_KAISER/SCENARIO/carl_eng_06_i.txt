Guadalajara

July 22nd, 1874

(Fictional scenario)

After crossing the Ebro our army has just found token resistance on its way to Madrid. We believe that the Republicans are concentrating most of their troops in the capital, where they plan to defeat us thanks to their superior numbers and equipment.
But we will not fall into their trap. While the bulk of the Northern Army occupies strategic positions on the outskirts of Madrid, we have ordered you to be diverted east to Guadalajara, where you will link with the Carlist units from Cataluña and Levante that the Infante Alfonso, the younger brother of Carlos VII, leads.
With these reinforcements we wil be able to attack Madrid from several fronts and victory will be certain. But before that happens you will have to defeat the liberal troops stationed in Guadalajara, that will surely try to prevent the Infante Alfonso's troops from intervening in our final offensive. Good Luck.

Victory conditions: Take all the VHs.
