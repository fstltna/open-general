Spartacus, we`ve spend the Winter at the Söuth and consolidated. But Crassus used the Time. He has build up a mighty siege. Could we break through and invade the interior of the country? It has to be done soon, because we are running out of supplys...

Historical:
M. Licinius Crassus became Prätor and voluntarily took command of the Troops against Spartacus. The defeated Troops of Subleader Mummius had to endure the Decimation (Every 10th legionary was executed). Trough this harsh treatment he bucked up his Troops and brought the Slaves to the edge of a defeat.

Spartacus had spend the Winter at the bleak headland of South Italy. The escape overseas using the kilikian Pirates worked, despite a big advanced payment. That was how he had to break trough the siege of Crassus. At their first try about 12.000 Slaves died and it looked as if the fate of the Slave army was sealed. But the tide turned. At their second try the Slaves suddenly recovered their old strength, broke through the siege and invaded the interior of the Province Lukania.
