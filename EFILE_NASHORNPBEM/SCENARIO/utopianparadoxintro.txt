SHOWCASING OPEN GENERAL PBEM IN ALL ITS GLORY OVER 32 TURNS!!

"THE STRATEGIC ADDED TO THE TACTICAL" - Nashorn

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"For the Russian commander the new offensive has sharply turned from a crushing final enveloping attack to one of doubt and defensive counter readjustment as shocking reports of breakthrough German attacks in new sectors come through within hours of the Russian launch. 
Do the Russians stick to or abandon their grand offensive?.

The Germans are holding the main battleline and are certain a swift strike from the NW around Dropov, plus an airborne landing with naval resupply in the NE around Rostoff and also a huge armour spearhead up the West flank, will cause the eventual collapse of the whole front.

The Russians were hoping a massive push down the East Flank around Salem plus increasingly supplied partisan activity in the SW and also a new Navy beachhead in the SE around Oil Depot Alpha would finally bring the Germans to their knees.

Hold what you have and take the fight to the enemy!!" 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The game is designed to be played with 250% Prestige on both sides and the manual House Rules below:-

2/ Germans Production: Limited to only 1 of the same type of any German unit on the map at any one time except for unlimited normal Regular Infantry.(Automatically added Reinforcements dont count).

3/ Deployment Speed:   Limited to deploying only 1 ground unit from each Supply Hex owned per turn. Air units have unlimited deployment per turn from Airfields as per normal.

4/ The 4 Corner Supply Hexes: Become deactivated immediately once the nearest Victory Hex (NW-Dropov Airfield/NE-Rostoff Town Hall/SW-Partisan Base/SE-Oil Depot Alpha) to the corresponsing Supply Hex is taken by any enemy unit. Can be reactivated immediately if Victory Hex recaptured.

5/*** REPLAY OF OPPONENTS TURN HAS TO WORK TO BE A VALID TURN***

"This Scenario is a long, complex, fantasy, micro-managed, houseruled, prestige heavy Giant but hopefully everybody will have fun with its endless possiblities, humour, epic gameplay and serious challenge that it contains. This is a mini game within a game, with my main aim for it to become the default scenario test to find out who is the no.1 Open General Player out there LOL."
