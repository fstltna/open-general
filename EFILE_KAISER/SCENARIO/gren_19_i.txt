Cambrai: the German counterattack

November 30th, 1917

Only three days later, a strong and extremely well-planned German counterattack began. On our right flank, near Gouzeaucourt, the break was swift. Two of our divisions seemed to evaporate, and the Guards, still recovering after the combats at Bourlon and Fontaine, were called as reinforcements to that area.

Arriving there, we found a horrific sight; hundreds of half-dressed men, surprised in their sleep and on the verge of panic, were fleeing the front, without rifles or equipment. Among them there were many officers. They talked about a massive German bombardment prior to the attack, and there were rumours that the enemy had managed to penetrate deep into our lines, with the help of some kind of new assault infantry against which our trenches and bunkers had been useless.

I knew that if panic spread all our front could be in serious danger, I ordered my men to keep calm, to stand firm at Gouzeaucourt, and to defend our lines at all costs.
