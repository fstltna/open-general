Agagia, 26th February 1916

During the Gallipoli campaign in 1915 neither the Turks nor we had anything to spare for greater efforts in Sinai. So things here have been relatively quiet for some months. Our main concern at the moment are the Arab and Berber tribes of the Western Desert. The Senussi, a hostile religious fraternity led by Said Idris Ahmed, have declared "jihad" on us and our Italian allies, who have been occupying Libya since 1911. The Turks have delivered artillery and machine guns to the Senussi by German submarines, and equipped a force of about 5,000 bedouins with which Jaafar Pasha, a Turkish officer, intends to capture the small ports at the Libyan and Egyptian coast.

The Senussi raids already forced us to evacuate Sollum and Sidi Barrani, and the frontier posts have been withdrawn to Mersa Matruh. Now that considerable forces have returned from Gallipoli, we should be able to defeat this insurgency. The main hostile force has been reported to be at Agagia, somewhere south east of Sidi Barrani.

The 1st South African Brigade and an armoured car detachment of the Royal Navy Air Service (RNAS) will join your forces during this operation that should not only destroy the Senussi force, but also relieve Sidi Barrani.

NOTE: Our scouts will let you know as soon as they discover the exact location of the Senussi camp. So keep an eye on the map!
