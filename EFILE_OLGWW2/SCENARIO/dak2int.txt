Sollum Battle & Halfaya Pass

May 14th - 1941

Reports from the Fort Capuzzo and Halfaya Pass garrisons indicate that the British are preparing an assault on our positions. Sollum has been taken by the enemy, and surely the Italians will be forced from the Pass. Your divisions must drive to Fort Capuzzo to face the enemy offensive, and avoid a possible attack on our important backward positions at Bardia and Sidi Azeiz. Italian units from the 5a Squadra Aerea will arrive later to help you.

Historically, this was the last operation of General Wavell in North Africa, after this High Command pulled him out. This operation was called ''Operation Brevity''.
