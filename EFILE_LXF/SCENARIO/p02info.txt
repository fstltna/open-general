02. AZORES (15 August 1941)

The strict neutrality policy of Portugal has been in vain. It were not the British but the Germans who have and are offending our rights in the Azores island archipal in the Atlantic. German U-boats are hunting for ships there without our permission! We will defend our territory, we will defend the Azores!

Portugal has re-newed its old alliance with Britain, dating back from 1373 and we have offered the British bases on the Azores while they will deliver us modern armamanent. But British assistance will not be on the Azores for days to come. At the moment, your forces must defend the Azores!

Most islands of the Azores are being occupied by our forces however one small island is not yet. With the enemy threat this island will have to be occupied to deny it to the enemy. Furthermore you are to hold all important positions on the islands! It is unsure if the enemy will attack and with what. But we know for sure that enemy submarines are in the area. Good luck, General!
