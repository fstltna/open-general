Le combat de la Tête de Flandre

v.1.0
The Campaign of the 18 Days
(10-28 May 1940)

General,

Our troops are taking their new positions behind the Terneuzen canal and the Escaut/Scheldt River. The "Corps de Cavalerie" has to secure this movement.

We have been informed that some German troops of the 208 Infantry Division have crossed the Escaut/Scheldt river through one of the tunnels in Antwerpen/Anvers that, due once more to the absence of coordination with our allies, has not been completely destroyed. 

Given that the 17 DI, which is defending the area, is withdrawing to their new positions, you have to help the "2 Division de Cavalerie" to re-establish the situation.   

Le Chef d'Etat-major général de l’armée (EMGA)

Warning: the 17 DI will retreat in the first turns. You can only deploy 5 units.

Victory conditions: to hold 4 VH for a BV, 3 VH for a V and 2 VH for a TV.
