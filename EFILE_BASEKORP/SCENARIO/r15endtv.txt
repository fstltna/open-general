TACTICAL VICTORY

Excellent news from the fronts are arriving to our glorious leader. The fascist forces at Stalingrad have finally been forced to surrender. We have liberated Rostov again and the Caucasus has been liberated entirely but for the Kuban region. The danger for the oilfields is gone and our winter offensive has been a great success!
