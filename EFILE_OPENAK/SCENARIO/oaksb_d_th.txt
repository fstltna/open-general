Thermopylae

April 17, 1941

The Germans attempt to push through the Australian and New Zealand lines on the way to Athens, Greece.

Notes:  There is a leader available when the Germans when they capture Ano Train Station in the centre of the map.  The Germans will want to take the station with a unit that has no leader if you want to take advantage of this.  Capturing the Allied airfield for the Germans in the south near the final objective will also raise a prototype fighter unit.
