You almost made it, but the British were too strong. A few days before the end of the war your army has finally been defeated and you were forced to surrender. Play this scenario again if you want a better result.


Historical aftermath: After playing cat and mouse with the Entente colonial armies for more than four years during which he never suffered a decisive defeat.  This in spite of being desperately outnumbered.  Von Lettow-Vorbeck surrendered in Abercorn on 23 November 1918 after learning of the armistice that had been signed in France 12 days before.  His remaining army then consisted of 30 German officers, 125 German non-commissioned officers and other enlisted ranks, 1,168 Askaris and some 3,500 porters.

Von Lettow-Vorbeck returned to Germany in March 1919 and received a hero's welcome. He led some of his troops on a victory parade through the Brandenburg Gate which was decorated in their honor. 
In 1953 he visited East Africa again on his way to South Africa. The day he arrived in Dares Salaam among the crowd was a small group of native old men waiting for him. When the old general passed they broke the security line and reached Von Lettow.  They knelt in front of  him before standing up again. They were surviving Askari who could join their old commander again. They started to sing their old hymn, "Heia Safari". Von Lettow hugged them and then they marched by the pier, singing "Heia Safari all the time. Those men were his guard of honor for the duration of the visit.

The campaign is over. We hope you have liked it, and thanks for playing.
