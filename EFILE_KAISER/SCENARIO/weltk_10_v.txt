The French offensive has been suspended due to the heavy casualties that they were suffering. There are even rumours of mutinies among many French divisions, and a certain risk of collapse of the French Army. Nivelle's folly may have given us what we were trying to achieve at Verdun: an exhausted and demoralized France.

Right now Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria, Russia, Italy and France can barely hold their own. They can still defend themselves, sure, but they lack the strength to launch any serious offensive operation. I hate to admit it, but that very same thing is happening to us here, at the Western Front. Only in the east do we have any chance to take the initiative.
The British, on the other hand, are in pretty good shape. Even after their terrible losses in Flandern and the Somme they still have many reserves, so in the following months I guess that the greatest danger for our soldiers will come from the British sector. However, a British attack isn't the worst thing that could happen to us. The worst-case scenario, by far, would be the United States entering the war. That would be the end of us.
