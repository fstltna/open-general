Though they had nearly been crushed into the snow of the Russian winter, the Allies had pushed the Soviets back from the borders of Germany all the way into Moscow.  The Germans, French and British, united in their common goal, attempted to enclose Moscow into a pocket from which no supplies could reach the city.
