Blowed by backhand
Herr General, the victory is within one`s reach, or maybe not. The Germans have evacuated the area of Charkow and withdraw their troops. Your army should push forward into the empty area and follow the escaping Germans. Many of our generals believe that the Germans are already beaten and the war will soon be over. But I am not so optimistic. So, be careful. 
Your troops:
You will only have your tank army for this task.
Enemy troops:
Our recons reported nearly no enemies in the area.
Please notice:
If you can hold all VHs you will come to a choice scenario, in which you must decide which Army Group you want to face for the rest of the war. If you cannot hold all VHs you will first have to fend the German attack at Prokhorowka.
Sgn. Major Heinz
