Herr General, although your performance was Good, and the Soviets have been driven back from the Valki sector, unfortunately they have made progress in other areas and have wrestled back Kharkov from us. Your men are again being pulled back out of the line, this time to be restructured as a panzer division!  Also, the 5th SS-Freiwilligen-Sturmbrigade Wallonien is being attached to your division to further bolster your strength..
