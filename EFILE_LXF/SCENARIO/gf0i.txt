Battle of the River Plate - December 13th, 1939

Your Panzerschiff (a.k.a. pocket battleship) Graf Spee has cruised into the South Atlantic a fortnight before the war began and has been commerce raiding after receiving appropriate authorisation on 26 September 1939.

Now mastheads have been sighted to the south-east. Destroy the ships if they turn out to be hostile.
