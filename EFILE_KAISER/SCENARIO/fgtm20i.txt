Novogeorgievsk, July 16, 1915

Gospodin General-Leitenant, having received reinforcements from the West, the German northern group of armies have joined the massive offensive against us.  The German summer offensive in Poland has focused on trapping our forces in the Polish cauldron:  the heaviest blow has fallen on the Przasnysz-Novogeorgievsk front.  You must take control of the situation and delay the German advance so that our supply and communication lines can retreat from Warsaw!

Amassing artillery, the Germans have destroyed railways and our trench lines.  As you retreat into the fortress of Novogeorgievsk, you should gather the rail-transported supplies and use them to increase the fighting capabilities of your troops.  As soon as you receive the evacuation order, you can begin the retreat with your troops in rear-guard, but you must hold the Novogeorgievsk fortress in its entirety!
