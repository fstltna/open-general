All right, let's go back to a more traditional environment.

There is a huge city to conquer, right under this message panel. It's heavily defended, and all those rivers won't help your mobility. Even worse, on the other side of the bay, down south,  is a Victory Hex you need to collect, but no land road leads there; You'll have to cross the bay somehow.
You get a little help, in the shape of a free specialized marine assault infantry unit in an amphibious transport. Will it be enough, all on its own?

The enemy has an annoying and quite dangerous air force at this point. You might want to protect your units, especially the more vulnerable ones. I really hope you found the hidden Flakpanzer IV "Kugelblitz" in the previous scenario...
