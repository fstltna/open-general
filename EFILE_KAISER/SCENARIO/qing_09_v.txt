When the Chinese liberated Mukden and Siping, a wave of panic spread among the Russians, who quickly fled from most of Manchuria. The Manchu Bannermen could retake Harbin and other important towns quite easily, and by the end of the year most of Manchuria was again under Chinese control. Finally, the Russians realized that being on good terms with China would be less costly and much more profitable than invading its neighbours. Russia and China signed a honourable peace and, finally, the last foreign army that remained in China left the country.

The recent events had proved that the modernisation of the Chinese Army was essential for the survival of China. It had been a difficult and expensive task, but obviously the results had been excellent. The Qing Empire had, for the first time in decades, a military power that could guarantee the country's independence. 

In the next years the administrative, economic and military reforms continued, especially after Empress Dowager Cixi's death in 1908. Although China is still far from being a wealthy country, the results of the reforms have been positive. Besides, China benefited greatly from the World War. With a masterly use of diplomacy and threat of force the Chinese managed to recover most of the territorial concesions that they had been forced to cede in the XIX century. Later, Chinese intervention was crucial to defeat the Bolshevik revolution in Russia. 

Now China has become one of the main powers in the Pacific. Naturally, the rivalry with Russia, Japan and even the United States still goes on, but my adopted country is respected all over the world. Definitely, the Qing Empire isn't the sleeping dragon that I met in 1883 anymore. And I'm not the same person, either. In the end  I've lived a good life in China, but I'll always wonder if it has been the kind of life that my parents wished for me. 

The campaign is over. I hope you've liked it and thanks for playing.
