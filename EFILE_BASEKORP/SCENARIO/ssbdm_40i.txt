  The Reports were coming in from the Recon units.Soviet Tanks all over the place.A clerk ran into the Command Post of Frau General Elverfeldt "Yes General they are their too,We are completely surrounded.The Recon Commanders say they have never seen so many tanks"."How the Hell,ah it doesn't matter.I should have known this was never going to end til we're all dead.Ilse just had to get Me out of My nice cozy office in Berlin smack dab into a mess as this.I'll tell You She loses a few hands of cards and She gets so pissed and now who has the losing hand,Yours truly.Who the Hell do they think is commanding the Soviets here". "It is Kybiak Rubik,Frau General"." And I thought there wasn't an Officer in the East worthy to be called a Commander.My mistake and now it may be one of the last ones I get to make.Well get the Panzer Commanders in here and get on the phone,tell the Air Korps we've stirred up a Hornets Nest and could use all the aid We can get.We're You able to get a hold of 'Frann or 'Nerts Group"."The message got sent out but no reply as of yet"."If We get out of this I'm getting back on a Plane,getting My Ass back to Berlin and going to shove a High Heel up Ilse's butt.I need Combat Experience like I need a hole in My head".Commander Rubik contacted Stalin, "Let's see the SS Bitches solve this puzzle".
