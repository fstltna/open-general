Battle for Teruel v. 1.1 

In the frozen Winter of 1937, the Spanish Nationalist had an important point to continue his offensive: the city of Teruel, as a ''gun aiming to the hearth of the Spanish Levante''. The Spanish Popular Army could not allow this, and an offensive to retake Teruel was planed and launched under temperatures around -28 degrees...
