The Muencheberg Breach

04/19/1945

On day four of the battle the 9th Army was ripped apart by the powerful Soviet tank thrusts. There was no chance of holding the Soviets back any longer. The only course of action now was to withdraw from the Oder. But soon the Soviet tanks had regrouped and concentrated in front of Muencheberg for the last push towards Berlin.

12 deploy hexes. New units have strength 8. You have to hold all victory hexes for a BV, three (3) of them for a V and one (1) of them for a TV.
A loss is no shame here.
