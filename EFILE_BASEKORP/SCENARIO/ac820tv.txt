Come in General! A toast of mulled wine!

Your troops fought well.

We have made breif contact with 6th Army, but, Hitler refused to allow a withdrawl!  4th Panzer Army and our forces struggle hold the corridor open and every day it gets smaller!

Manstein had reportedly flown to Berlin to confer directly with Hilter on the reality of the situation, Madness!  Yet, that apparently did not help.

We have been relieved of command by Hitler himself.  He has replaced every commander involved in the relief attack down to division level!

I am to report to OKW for assignment in Norway, and you General?  I here that Marshall Graziani will get you out of Hitlers attention by sending you to the Balkans.
