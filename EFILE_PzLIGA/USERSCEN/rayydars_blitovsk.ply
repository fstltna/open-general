Brest-Litovsk

At september 12th 1939 the Wehrmacht has allready conquered the western half of Poland. Now she tries to take the passing over the river Bug and then continue with the Blitz in order to engage the soviet "ally" as far eastern as possible. On one hand, the strong fortress Brest-Litowsk massively delays the german advance. On the other hand, the brave polish army is positioned and equipped with old stuff - despite of some tank units, which are as strong as the german tanks or even superior.
If the Wehrmacht is successful in rapidly gaining the air superiority, its advance will very hard to stopp.

This scenario is historically not correct. Brest-Litowsk was conquered by the Wehrmacht, but later given to the Soviets, who meanwhile had occupated the eastern half of Poland. The same scenario took place once again 1941 against the Red Army!
