We made hardly any progress and we know the British fleet has left Scapa Flow and is heading south at full speed. This is turning sour very fast.
We need you to unlock the Thames estuary, the easiest way to London for our troops. And we need it to be done immediately!

The estuary region is just as fortified as Dover was, and this time you'll only have your own planes for air support. Parts of the 724th Panzer Division have broken throught and have reached Canterbury though; They could help you secure the south coast, but they have suffered heavy losses and you'll probably have to do most of the work yourself. Be careful, we're at a tipping point of the invasion, your actions will decide if this will evolve into a glorious victory or a bitter defeat.
And remember, one of the biggest fleet in the world is barreling towards you as we speak - Make haste! Just in case, we've detached another U-Boat to your task force, to help at least save the carriers. 

Last thing, beware of those AA towers on stalks the British have planted in the estuary. You might want to destroy those things before they start taking potshots at you.



Instructions: Take all VHs. You also control some land-based troops. You've been given another submarine and a repair vessel which can repair your ships. Last but not least, remember, a huge fleet is coming. Apparently they will be there in a couple days and it would be better if you're gone by then since you have no absolutely no chances to beat them.
