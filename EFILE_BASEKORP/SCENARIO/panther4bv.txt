Loss at Smolensk was a huge blow for Wehrmacht. German lines were collapsing, Army Group South was torn away, and a threat against Moscow was definitely stopped. Local victories like the one that you've achieved, couldn't change much.

Your command was brilliant, and it was decided that you'll get another Panthers to equip a second company with them. Rest of the Pz IV tanks are thought to be quite formidable... for the moment.
