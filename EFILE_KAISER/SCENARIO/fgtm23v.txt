The outcome of the Battle of Wilna saw the Russian 10th Army retreating to a line just east of Lake Narotch, with its flanks supported by the 2nd Army in the south and a combined cavarly army in the north.  The German VI Cavalry Corps suffered great casualties in the battle without achieving a strategic breakthrough.  By October the front lined had solidified, and positional warfare gripped the Eastern Front once again.

An inquiry into the quality of reinforcements arriving to the front on both sides illustrates a tragic horror of the war:  throwing large nubmers of Landwehr and Reserve divisions into the offensive, the German army was beginning to exhibit the death toll it has suffered since August on both fronts.  Likewise on the Russian side, the 2nd and 3rd line (Opolchenie) divisions spoke to the horrific losses in Galicia and Poland.
