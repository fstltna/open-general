Good Morning Major. The situation here around Tolvajarvi has been somewhat stabilized, but is still critical. We have decided to boost dwindling morale and gain the initiative by launching a counter attack aimed at encircling and destroying as many units of the Soviet 139th division as possible. Show them what Finnish resolve can acheive!
