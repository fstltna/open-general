During the Battle of Debrecen, Armeegruppe Fretter-Pico (with elements of Hungarian 2nd and 3th Armies) achieved a major success against the Red Army. While avoiding encirclement, Axis troops managed to encircle and destroy three Soviet tank corps. At the beginning of the battle, the situation on the ground was greatly confused, with neither the Soviets nor the Germans knowing who was surrounding whom. Then the German 23rd and 1st Panzer Divisions (led by Tiger II panzers) arrived from Budapest and completed the encirclement of Pliyev's group. On October 26, the 23rd Panzer Division recaptured Nyíregyháza. Meanwhile, the German 8th Army began moving out through the escape route created through Nyíregyháza.

The Nyíregyháza counter-attack was the last time that German forces were to defeat a full-strength Red Army force on even terms. By pinching off the breakthrough exploitation group of the 2nd Ukrainian Front offensive, the Germans were able to re-establish a stable front line position, and thus prevent the 2nd Ukrainian Front's advance from becoming a catastrophe for the German 8th Army. The German success, was however short-lived as Nyíregyháza was captured by the Red Army on October 30.

On October 15, 1944, the Hungarian governor, Admiral Miklós Horthy, announced that Hungary had accepted an armistice with the USSR. Reacting quickly, Hitler ordered Otto Skorzeny to launch Operation Panzerfaust. By October 16, 1944, Skorzeny and his SS paratroopers had averted disaster by blackmailing Horthy into resigning and giving control of the government to Ferenc Szálasi, a pro-German leader.
