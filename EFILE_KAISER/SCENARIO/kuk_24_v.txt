You've done it! Malta is ours and the war is over! At last, those stubborn British have accepted the offer of a Peace With Honour. 

Under the terms of the treaty Britain will acknowledge the Austro-German gains from the war, whilst we'll respect the imperial possessions of Britain, Japan and Portugal. Specifically, Venedig will be again part of our Empire, and we'll share the possession of Malta with the Germans.

That may seem a very small prize after all that we've been through. Germany will become the main military power in the world. Even small Bulgaria will have a hegemonic position in the Balkanen. And what about us? Unlike our allies, we'll get very little.

But, after all, we didn't enter the war to conquer more land. We just wanted to preserve the Empire and destroy our enemies, and we have achieved both goals. We have survived. That's what we wanted, isn't it?

It wouldn't have happened without you. You've been our best commander, by far. You've played a large part in this victory. We all thank you for that. And now, it's time to rebuild the Empire. We'll need good statesmen for that. And, you know? You could teach them a couple of things. In fact, there is a rumour that, very soon, the Kaiser will ask you to do exactly that.

The campaign is over. I hope you've liked it and thanks for playing.
