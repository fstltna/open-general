08. LIBERATION OF BRABANT (18 October 1944)

STRATEGIC SITUATION:
Operation Market-Garden has failed. We now have an enormous saliant in German controlled territory. It is essential that we secure our flanks. British units will push east from the corridor to the Maas river. Scottish and Polish troops and your force will push north west from the corridor towards the Maas river. You will be fighting in the Dutch province of Brabant. Polish units will concentrate on Breda in western Brabant. Scottish units will head for Tilburg while you and a Scottish brigade will head for Sint Hertogenbosch. The liberation of Brabant has begun!

TACTICAL ORDERS:
Your force is deployed west and north west of Eindhoven. You must push north to Sint Hertogenbosch and the Maas river. The 44th Scottish brigade will attack on your right flank towards Oss. Together you must be able to free this part of the Netherlands! You will be facing the German 711th infantry division which is still a worthy opponent even when the SS forces that fought weeks earlier at Arnhem and Grave have left the area except for a small Kampfgruppe.
