51 B.C. : Ambush in the Alps

These traitorous Norici have always been friends of the Romans .... They have just waited until our vanguard is pre-marched to join the Romans again ... They have already enclosed us, and a Roman legion suddenly appears from the east...

 
[The Supreme druid approaches towards you:] 
The Roman legion seems to consist only of freshly recruited man with no appreciable combat experience .... The Norici traitors are a substantially serious opponent ...

.... anyhow .... from tomorrow on small groups of our vanguard will arrive with us every day; and our main army in a few days .... we should simply entrench and survive .....

The moment the main army reached us, the Romans and the traitors have lost .... they know this, of course, and will attack us even more desperately on the front ....
