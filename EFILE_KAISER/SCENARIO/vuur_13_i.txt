Rescue at Paardeberg

February 21st, 1900

While you were fighting in Colesberg General Cronjé, knowing that Roberts was getting close with three divisions, retired most of his troops up the Modder River. He thought that he could outflank the Rooineks and counterattack from a better position, but Roberts was faster than expected, and some days ago he trapped Cronjé on the Paardeberg Drift on the banks of the Modder River. He won't be able to resist for much longer.

Christiaan de Wet has managed to escape the British siege, but his troops are too weak to give Cronjé's any real help. You and you men are the last hope for his army. If you fail, we might lose our freedom forever.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.
- Your MSU core unit must survive.
