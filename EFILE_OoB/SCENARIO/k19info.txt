19. COPENHAGEN (29 August 1943)

TO: Generaladmiral
SUBJECT: Operation Safari

---Since our succesful operation Weserubung we have partly occupied Denmark and worked together with the Danish government. However, the situation has arisen that we are forced to fully occupy Denmark and disarm the Danish Armed Forces. While this is a task which is far from difficult, the Danish Royal Navy can become nasty. 

The Danish Royal Navy is trying to escape from its home port of Copenhagen, the Danish capitol, to neutral Sweden. This cannot be accepted. The Swedish Royal Navy could use the ships itself and become a worthy opponent of the Kriegsmarine. You have been given order to sink all Danish ships trying to escape. 

Furthermore the occupation of Denmark is taking place by units of the Army. Your Marine Corps, however, will assist in the taking of Copenhagen. The 25th Panzer Division, arriving from Norway, will assist you from inland. The Danish have a very small, but trusty Army.--- 

NOTE: Be sure to deploy sufficient ships. The Danish Navy is quite strong and has plenty of subs. So also deploy some destroyers. And be careful!
