Unternehmen Taifun (1 Oct 1941)
First part of the "Blitzkrieg!" minicampaign.

STRATEGIC SITUATION:
Starting in the early days of October 1941, Unternehmen Taifun was a second stage of the German strategical offensive against Moscow.

TACTICAL ORDERS:
Your light tanks company is a part of a battalion tasked with breaking through the Soviet defense west of Vyazma. A river crossing is held by enemy artillery, but your motorcyclists found a ford north of your starting positions. Infantry support must outflank the artillery, clear the village, and secure the bridgehead. Rush towards your main objective and rendezvous with forward elements of Waffen-SS division approaching from the south. Destroy the Soviet barrier troops in the nearby city.

RECONNAISSANCE:
Soviet forces are comprised mainly of lower-quality troops, untrained conscripts, and partisan fighters based in the nearby hamlets. Destroy the NKVD blocking units as this will facilitate a complete annihilation of Soviet resistance in the area.

NOTE:
Don't waste units on garrison duties. Move forwards as fast as possible, knocking out the Soviets one by one by your local superiority in numbers.

VICTORY CONDITIONS:
Either capture all Victory Hexes or destroy all enemy units marked as "Must Survive" to claim the victory!
