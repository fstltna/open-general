TACTICAL VICTORY

Fine work, sir.  In spite of an initial wobble when the Germans launched a co-ordinated counter-attack, we were able to hold our beachhead thanks to determined and steadfast  British courage.  The Germans have now halted their attacks and are adopting a defensive posture.  While the rest of X Corps breaks out to the north, your men will rest and recuperate after a testing battle.
