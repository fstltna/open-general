
FORT BRAGG - 19 AUG 1943

Winston-Salem, North Carolina, United States

Our forces which should unite with your troops at Winston-Salem could not achieve its goals! Strong enemy forces threatened theirs northern flank. Most of the motorized units was removed from the attack to catch the enemy's move. The infantry was not strong enough to continue the attack alone and had to change into defense in unfavorable terrain. 
These infantry units were now also hard pressed by the enemy, and our encircle operation threatens to fail! Act quickly and save our units from destruction! 
Unfavorably the heavily fortified base Fort Bragg is located just between you and our distressed troops. Try to bypass Fort Bragg and attack the enemy in the back! Afterwards take care of the U.S. base and capture this main target!

GOAL: Take all VH's and ensure that 18 of 35 of your MSUs survive and not more then 14 enemy units reach the Exit Points!
