TACTICAL VICTORY

Vienna is saved! Although the Czechs published photos of their soldiers in the streets of one of the Reich's pearls, we can now publish photos of dead Czechs lying in and around Vienna! THe morale has gone up, and the Czech 3rd Army from Slovakia has suffered a huge defeat. The world now sees that the German Wehrmacht is capable of defending its territory succesfully. This will surely scare off any country to intervene in this conflict.
