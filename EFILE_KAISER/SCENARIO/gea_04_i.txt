Salaita Hill

After Jan Smuts took command of the British forces in East Africa he started his large scale offensive against Von Lettow at the region of Taveta. This town is located on the British side of the border near Mount Kilimanjaro.  It had been occupied by the Germans in order to have a base for their raids against the Uganda Railway.

Salaita Hill was a strategic post west of Taveta. It was thought to be defended by a small German detachment.  This marked it as an initial objective for Smuts' offensive.  Two British brigades commanded by Gen. Beves were ordered to attack Salaita on February 1916.
