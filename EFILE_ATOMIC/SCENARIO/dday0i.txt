ORDERS: 

It is time for D-Day. Your troops should land on Omaha Beach and fight their way through the Atlantic Wall into the hinterland of the Normandy, establishing a beachhead. After the Atlantic Wall the 352th Infantry division and the 439th Ost-Batallion will be your opponents. Maybe some tank troops will arrive the battlefield in a few days.

A few hints: 

Reconniasance is very important. There are only three points from which an attack will be promising. Our troops are too weak to attack on all three positions at once. Prepare your infantry attack with heavy bombings and support fire from our ships. The way back home is too far away for our bombers so we need one real airfield or many builded airfields.
