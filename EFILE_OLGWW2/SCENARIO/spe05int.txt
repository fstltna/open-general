Tehran

June 1st, 1943

After the fall of Baghdad, we will never again suffer from the lack of fuel. Only Persia, one of the places with the most petrol reserves in the World, is still not under our control. Please give me a moment to explain to you the Persian situation:-

In past years, Persia was a pro-German country, however in the first days of 1943 the Soviets, aided by some remaining British units who escaped from other fronts, (mainly of the 8th Army), have invaded the country. The King of Persia, Reza Shah (forced by the invaders) has abdicated. Fortunately for us, some Persian army officers, still loyal to Reza Shah, have contacted us offering their help to kick out the Soviets and the British from Persia. Intelligence reports that the Armed Persian Police, and the weak Persian Air Force will remain under the enemy control, also, a good number of Soviet tanks have been spotted. There is only an airstrip near to Tehran, so you must take it to allow our airforce to be deployed there. Also, Japanese forces have disembarked in Iraq, and have sent us reinforcements.

Your task is to aid the Persian "rebels" in clearing Tehran. With a success here, Persia surely will be an important ally in the coming years.
