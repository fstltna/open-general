Herr General,

We have the unique opportunity to encircle 2 large Soviet Armies in the area west of Minsk. The original Barbarossa battleplan called for this to be done in one huge pincer movement, however the Fuhrer is worried about the risk of large scale breakouts of the trapped Russians. OKH has therefore decided this will be achieved by 2 pincers instead.

Army Group Centre Battleplan:

1. Your II Panzergruppe is to take the southern arm of the large pincer and meet with Panzergruppe III between Minsk and Novogrudok.

2. The IXth Army will move south-east from Grodno and meet the IVth Army which will move north-east from Kobryn to the east of Volkovysk.

3. It is to be made clear to divisional commanders that speed is vital so units are not to be delayed attempting to take the encircled cities these will be mopped up by trailing divisions.

Player Note: Don't take Volkovysk and Novogrudok.

Recomended purchase: - Infantry + Upgrades and overstrengthening.

Suggested Core: - 3x Tank, 1x Anti-Tank, 5x Infantry, 2x Recon, 2x Artillery, 1x Air Defence, 1x Fighter, 1x Tac Bomber (Including Protos).

Max Core: - 17x Ground Units.

Good luck.
