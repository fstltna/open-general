Tapa
January 9, 1919

Kolonel, following a resounding victory over the Red Army at Tallinn, we are given the opportunity to pursue the retreating Bolsheviks.  The city of Tapa lies near the Tallinn-Narva railroad.  It appears elements of the 7th Army are retreating toward it.  You must capture Tapa and cut off the path of retreat for these forces.  Time is of essence in this mission.

NOTE: a Brilliant Victory is not possible in this scenario, since this battle has little strategic value:  it is rather a tactical exercise for your troops.
