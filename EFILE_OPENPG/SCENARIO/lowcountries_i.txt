We have given you the key role in the invasion of France. You are to annihilate the French, British and Belgian armies located west and north of the Ardennes. In order to ensure their destruction, the early capture of Paris, and the opportunity to invade England this summer,  you must advance to the English Channel and capture all of the objectives no later than June 8th. A swift blow, delivered to the Allied armies as soon as possible, is essential to allow us time for an invasion of England this year.
