
OPERATION EDELWEISS
5 Oct 1942

Hypothetical German airborne assault on the Russian black sea port Batumi. The bridgehead should be set free by Army Group A assaulting the Caucasus. Afterwards the paratroopers should jump around Baku to protect Soviet oil fields. This plan of paratrooper General Kurt Student appeared to the OKH and OKW however too utopian.
