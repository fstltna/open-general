Alexandria

November 3rd, 1942

Finally, after the complete defeat of the main British army at El Alamein, we can assault the strongly important port of Alexandria. Unfortunately, some enemy units have escaped from the El Alamein area, and now they are trying to set up defences in and around Alexandria. Air Recon reports show that the Royal Navy has come to protect the port, our Italian friends will send the Regia Marina to help us in the assault, and to face the Royal Navy.

Viel Gluck!
