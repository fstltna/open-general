Varian read the list "but Your Fuhress,this is hardly any of the names I gave You"."Watch Your tone there Amerikan" Ilse's adjuntant stated "Your speaking to the Fuhress". "That's the best I can do for You Amerikan,You and Your Jewish entourage.We got a War going on.I can send them all back to the Resettlement areas in the Ghetto's if You choose".Varian on a Mission sponsored by Miss Roosevelt to save the Culture of the Jews talked with His little group,there was nothing more that could be done.Varian didn't see it but the Jews by Him saw it.They were in the presence of someone who had orchestrated the Deaths of thousands of Jews if not Millions.The deal was made, 1.2 million for lives.The SS loaded the mass of People on the 4 Amerikan cruise liners.For these People the Horror of the SS was over,they would be taken back to Amerika.The ships loaded they began to pull out from the Docks.The Fuhress stood there.Varian and the American Jewish Council watched from aboard the ship the funds in the suitcases on the Dock that had just bought lives.A SS Frau doused the suitcases with Gas and threw a match.Ilse walked back to Her car."Your so Dam Cruel Ilse" Frau Lohr told Her.A smile came across the face of the Fuhress "Yes I know.I have to deal with stupid People as Amerikans. It is a Necessity.They think their saving the Scum of this World,their just postponing It's Eradication for a later date.It is inevitable some will cease to be when Germania arrives".
