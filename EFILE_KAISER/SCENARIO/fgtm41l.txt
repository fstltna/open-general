The Kavkaz campaign of 1916 continued with two more major operations:  the capture of the port of Trapezond on the Black Sea coast in April and the defeat of a Turkish attempt to recapture Erzerum in August.  With the British Mesopotamian army surrendering at Kut, our operations in Persia and Mesopotamia ceased.

Due to your utterly disgusting performance at Erzerum, your command will be transferred to a desk.

By 1917 the once mighty Kavkaz Army was reduced to a series of garrisons, totaling several tens of thousands of men:  the European fronts of the war continued to devour our troops.  In the summer of 1917 Turkey resumed the offensive:  only to be halted by an emerging Armenian army in 1919.
