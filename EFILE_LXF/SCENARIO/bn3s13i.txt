General, we need the important city of Changsha.  If we start our venture to the south it will destroy China's ability for a counter offensive.  We will prepare our attack with massive bombings along with a new weapon, the Dash Forward Paratroopers.  They will support your troops.  Enemy counterattacks are expected from the northwest, but we will provide you with timely reinforcements.

ORDER - Capture & protect all VHs!
AUXIN - 1 Airborne- & 1 Infantry-Brigade
