Karfreit- November, 1917 - TV

Well, your decisions haven’t been particularly brilliant, but in the end the Italian defences collapsed. We’ve captured thousands of prisoners, and our divisions are marching unopposed to Udine. This is our greatest victory in the west since the war started! Now we must continue our advance before the Italians can react. If we are fast enough, we could force Italy to surrender. However, I fear that we’ve wasted a precious time, and that our enemies will build new defences in a matter of days.
