Historical:

After escaping from Capua they settled at the foot of Vesuvius, and hold up transports to get to food. So they also came to weapons. In the course of time, more and more slaves and outlaws joined the group, as their leader Spartacus was chosen. His lieutenants were the Celts Crixus and Oinominos. 
The response of the Romans was hampered by the absence of the Roman legions, which were already engaged in fighting a revolt in Hispania and the Third Mithridatic War. So the Senate sent propraetor C. Claudius Glaber with only 3000 recruits.
