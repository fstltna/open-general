I was amazed by the stubbornness and determination of the German assaults, so similar to those made by the Dervishes at Omdurman. In both cases waves of soldiers, some of whom were very young and lacked any proper training, charged to their deaths without any sign of hesitation or fear. In the end their sacrifice was futile, as even their hearts had to know.

But I could not enjoy my victory. When the battle was almost over, German artillery shelled the house where I was spending the night, shrapnel injured my chest, and I had to be taken to a campaign hospital. It could have been worse. A few days later my friend Samuel Lomax, who commanded the 1st division, was mortally wounded, again due to German artillery fire, and the first battle of Ypres also claimed the life of old Lord Roberts, the man who had created the concentration camps at South Africa. Indeed, all they that live by the sword shall perish by the sword.

The battle of Ypres ended in November without a clear winner. We managed to save the Channel ports, but neither side could outflank the other, and impenetrable lines of trenches were built all the way from the Northern Sea to the Swiss border. Maneuvering had become impossible, and waiting idly was not an option, lest we give Germany free rein to defeat Russia in the East. That left only one alternative, which I feared the most: we would fight the worst war of attrition that mankind had ever seen, launching frontal assault after frontal assault and suffering tens of thousands of casualties each time, until in the end one side could not resist any more and would be forced to surrender. I would have to put all of my efforts in finding a way to minimize the losses in the units under my direct command.
