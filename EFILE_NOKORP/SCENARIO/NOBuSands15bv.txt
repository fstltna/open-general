Great, that will stop them for a while, hopefully.

Rest and repair, our position isn't secure yet. As expected, the British army has overrun the Italian defenses behind us and has taken almost all Libya - again...
We're trapped in Tunisia, well, in a small part of Tunisia getting smaller by the day. The British are coming from the south-east while the Americans push from the north-west.

We have no hope of retaking Libya, this time we're vastly outnumbered. It's time for damage control, our priority is to not get surrounded by the Allies' armies which are closing on us from both sides.
Fortunately we still controll the port of Gabès, it's our last way out if everything fails.
