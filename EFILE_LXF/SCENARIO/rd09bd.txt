Passage To Madrid

February 14, 1950

With the conquest of France finally complete, the Soviet 4th Division spearheads the attack on remaining enemy forces in Allied Spain.  With the Spanish government too weak to muster any kind of military response, it falls to the local French and British defenders to stop the Soviets before the Red Army reaches Madrid.
