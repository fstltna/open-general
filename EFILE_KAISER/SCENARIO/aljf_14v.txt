----{secret telegraph depeche to general}-----
THE WHITE HOUSE; WASHINGTON,

Dear Sir,
disregarding your success we are forced to pull back your troops. One of the best enemy generals, general Lee, is threatening our lins in the southeast.
Fortunately we early recognized the importance of railways and are therfore able to move troops for hundreds of miles very fast.

We send your corps as reinforcement of our front.

Stop General Lee at any cost !!!

THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
