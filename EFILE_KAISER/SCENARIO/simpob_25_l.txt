Everything was in vain. Kolchak was killed and we were forced to cross the frozen Baikal. I won't make it. I was wounded during the combats, and blood loss and cold will kill me very soon. Sadly, I won't be the only one. Thousands of people, including women and children, are dying as I write these last notes. We haven't got time, strength or resources to bury them, so we leave them where they fall. Actually, sometimes they don't fall. They freeze to death while they're standing, and they'll remain there, as ice statues on the snow, until the spring comes and the waters of the lake swallow them. 

I'll join them very soon. I'll give my notebook to one of my friends, and I hope that some day he'll be able to publish it. People need to know what happened. That will be my legacy when I'm gone. Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.
