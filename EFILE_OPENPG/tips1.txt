OPEN PANZER GENERAL Tips
Only Level Bombers can cause long term suppression.
Anti Aircraft can move and then fire at air units, if they move into a hex directly below the plane. They don't provide air defense.
Fire support only takes place if the supporting artillery is adjacent to the defender.
Units mounted in transport will not dismount automatically at the beginning of a new turn.
A City, Airfield, or Port that is destroyed cannot be used to deploy or upgrade units until Repaired. Only Level Bombers and Battleships can destroy a hex. 
Only Construction or Sapper units can repair a hex.
A Road that is destroyed slows movement across it.
Paratroopers have a chance of mis-dropping.
Ground condition can cycle through DRY, FROZEN, and MUD, depending on the season, climate, and persistent and prolonged weather patterns, and will affect movement rates accordingly.
Planes use Fuel and must be resupplied at appropriate times.
Units mounted in transport will not dismount if attacked.
