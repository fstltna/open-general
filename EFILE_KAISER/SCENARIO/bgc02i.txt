First Battle of Krithia - 28/04/1915
-----------------------------------------------------
General, after having secured the beachheads our next objective will be the heights of Achi Baba, possession of which would allow our artillery to range over the entire peninsula. The Turks have established new lines in front of Krithia, a small town at the slope of Achi Baba. Your task is to break through the Turkish line of defence and reach the heights.
One of your brigades will advance on the extreme left, the other two brigades in the centre. The French are to act as a pivot on the right, and advance along the coast. We are expecting massive Turkish reinforcements arriving very soon, so there is no time to lose. I count on you, General!

NOTE: There is an additional deployment hex on the utmost right flank of the French troops near the coast. (Historically, this was the position of the 2/South Wales Borderers who had landed at "S" beach, far off all other British troops.)
