
RETREAT TO THESSALONIKI - 8 APR 1941

South of Doiran Lake, Central Macedonia

As expected, the Germans invaded our country in support of their unsuccessful allies, the Italians. German armored forces, through Yugoslavia bypassing the Metaxas Line, are on their way to Thessaloniki and threaten to encircle our East Macedonia Army. I fear that we are not able to stop the Germans here. Withdraw your troops immediately to Thessaloniki and try to establish a new defense line there. Use for your non-motorized units the railway line Kilkis-Thessaloniki to escape the rapid German forces!

GOAL: Retreat 22 ground units via Exit Points or hold after the eighth turn 4 VHs for BV! Hold after the eighth turn 3 VHs or 2 VHs for V or TV!

NOTE: It is advisable to delay the deployment partly until the second turn, and then to send non-motorized units immediately via train on their journey. In this mission the AI has the first turn!

STORY: The 2nd Panzer Division (XVIII Mountain Corps) entered Yugoslavia from the east on the morning of 6 April and advanced westward through the Struma Valley. It encountered little resistance, but was delayed by road clearance demolitions, mines and mud. Nevertheless, the division was able to reach the day's objective, the town of Strumica. On 7 April, a Yugoslav counter-attack against the division's northern flank was repelled and the following day the division forced its way across the mountains and overran the Greek 19th Motorised Infantry Division units stationed south of Doiran Lake. Despite many delays along the mountain roads, an armoured advance guard dispatched toward Thessaloniki succeeded in entering the city by the morning of 9 April. Thessaloniki's capture took place without a struggle and was followed by the surrender of the Greek East Macedonia Army Section, taking effect at 13:00 on 10 April.
