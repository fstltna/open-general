Italian Alps - November 25th, 1917

Dear Anna,

Just a few quick lines to let you know that I’m well and safe. Our campaign in Italy proceeds extremely well. We’re very tired, our supply lines get longer everyday, and the Italians are quickly building new, stronger defence lines. But I’m confident. Each morning I wake up with the feeling that, with one more push, the Italians will surrender, just like the Romanians did. We’ll have time to rest later, when all this mess is over.

See you soon,

Hugo.

ORDERS: Oberst Bauernschmitt, the Italians are offering a ferocious resistance near the river Piave. They've gathered fresh troops and artillery, and they've filled the area with machine gun nests. Take your troops and, along with the Jäger Division, occupy Monte Tomba. From there, we could be able to overcome the last enemy defences.

OBJECTIVES: Take all VHs.

SPECIAL NOTE: Your newly purchased units will start with 99 exp. points.
