BACKGROUND

Operation Abstention was the code name given to the British invasion of the Italian island of Kastelorizo, off Turkey, during the Second World War, on late February 1941. The goal was to establish a pivotal base to challenge the Italian naval and air supremacy on the Dodecanese islands.

After the attack on Taranto and the successful offensive of Cirenaica, Britain and its Allies gained the upper hand along the Mediterranean. Confident that the neutralization of the Italian forces in the Dodecanese would be the next stage, the command of the Mediterranean Fleet planned the occupation of the tiny island of Kastelorizo, the easternmost of the chain, some 80 mi (70 nmi; 130 km) from Rhodes, to establish a motor torpedo boat base there. The operation was intended as a first step towards the control of the whole Aegean Sea. The Italians, however, were far from being on the brink of collapse. Their naval and aerial assets there were still capable of carrying out sporadic hit-and-run attacks on the Allied shipping between Egypt and Greece.
