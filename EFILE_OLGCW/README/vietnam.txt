The struggle for the liberation of Vietnam from European control began with the French defeat at Dien Bien Phu. Now, the communist forces are ready to continue with the Ho Chi Minh doctrines and complete the unification of Vietnam under one flag.

The Viet-Cong and the North Vietnam's Army are ready to face the capitalist imperialists in their struggle for the liberation of Vietnam.
