Citoyen General! The dethroned Habsburgs appointed Haynau (the butcher of Brescia) to the new commander in chief and started another invasion against us. They didn’t learn anything, did they? A cautiousless imperial division commanded by General Wyss is patroling on the left bank of River Rába. Send a few valuable battalions and surprise the insolent enemy.

Deploy Hexes: 14

ORDER: Take all VHs or eliminate the Austrian MSU HQ Infantry represents General Wyss.

NOTE: Don't sell you extra units, you can deploy them later.
