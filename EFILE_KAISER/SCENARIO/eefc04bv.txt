BRILLIANT VICTORY
------------------------------------------
Congratulations, General! Our troops gradually clawed their way forward to Katia, throwing back desperate counter-attacks as they hurled the enemy from one position after another. 

The enemy was shaken by the galloping of the horsemen against the strong front of his
position, and then demoralised by the suddenness with which his flank was enveloped and raked with fire. At the end of the day, the sand literally turned red, and many surviving Turks were surrendering without resistance.

But even though the enemy is falling back to his main position across the Sinai desert, having suffered more than 5,000 casualties, the exhaustion of our troops and horses leaves us with no means to exploit this splendid victory.
