Operaition Felix

Ah, Herr General, I hope you have enjoyed your leave.  As you know, the British fortress of Gibraltar is a serious threat to our operations in the Mediterranean region.  With the conquest of France, and your victory in Norway, now is the time to eliminate this threat to our control of the Mediterranean.  We have persuaded Spain to join us and our ally Italy in our attack on Gibraltar.
