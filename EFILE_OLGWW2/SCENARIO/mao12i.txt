Chosin Reservoir [Korean War]

27-11-1950 Chosin Reservoir, N of North Korea.

Your quick advance has created a salient in the enemy lines, like the one at the Chosin Reservoir.  This sector is protected by a North American division.  Your task is to make a surprise attack from two different directions and destroy the entire enemy division.  Be careful, our spies report that it's a crack division and they have air support from an improvised airstrip near the reservoir.  Air reinforcements are on the way.
