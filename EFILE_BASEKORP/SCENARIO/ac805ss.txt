Herr General, come in!

We are poised to strike the crushing blow!

Hitler has released us to complete the destruction of the forces trapped north of us.  We must act quickly to sieze the ports and Roads to the coast to prevent the Allies escape to Britain.

Your forces will be key since Rommel's panzerkorps has been engaged in defending the Arras area and will not be able to join the final drive.  Your corps will race up the coast taking the ports while mine will cut off the Allied forces from moving west.

STAFF INTEL: The Allies are spread thin but we have a long way to go General, The Allies will fight harder the closer we get to the sea.  The Allies air-power could be some trouble also.
