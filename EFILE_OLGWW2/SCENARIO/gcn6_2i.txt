Teruel Counteroffensive

Orders from: Burgos, January, 1938

Esto es urgente!  The Reds have defeated the 4th Brigade deployed at Teruel. Many prisoners were captured including the garrison commander Colonel Rey D'Harcourt.  The extreme cold and snow prevents us from deploying our air power to help smash the enemy advance.  This will be maybe problematic, but the Generalisimo's staff thinks your troops can retake Teruel.  This would allow us to continue our march to the Mediterranean.
