Panevezys, July 30, 1915

Gospodin General-Leitenant, with all hopes of retaining Poland disappearing, the North-Western Front is fighting rear-guard action as the armies retreat eastward.  Here at Panevezys we must delay the German attack while our forces take positions in the Kowno and Wilna fortresses.

The production of armored trains has visibly increased since their introduction in the fall of 1914, with 15 operational detachments from Finland to Galicia.  With action around major railroad hubs, you may consider the deployment of armored trains a viable option for the remainder of the campaign in 1915.
