Hello again General!

Your attack broke the communists just in time and as we speak our forces assemble to march on Madrid!

That was a very close battle, and costly!  

It will take some time for me to rebuild my Spanish Legions to honor my promise to support Italy in future campaigns.

Better luck to you in the future, yet take my thanks for victory.
