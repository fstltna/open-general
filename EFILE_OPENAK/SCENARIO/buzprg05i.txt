Dukla

Part 1/7 of the "Commanding the Corps" minicampaign.

*****

Battle of the Dukla Pass became one of the blooddiest battles of Czechoslovak Army in the East. The original goal was to capture Presov in five days and thus greatly improve situation of Slovak insurgents, but it instead took three days to capture Krosno alone. And in the meantime, German reinforces moved into the Pass...

Intelligence and reconnaisance: Krosno is heavily fortified and it looks like that unless for our siege artillery, it won't fall anytime soon. What lies deeper in the Pass, no one can tell, but even the initial defense is a hard nut to crack. Air reconnaisance confirms that German mobile reserves consisting of two tank divisions are moving in from the south. These, together with armoured units of the 1st Hungarian Royal Army, may prove very dangerous.

Although the initial plan was to break into Slovakia in five days, now it is clearly visible that such a thing is completely impossible. The enemy defence is extremely firm and we must fear the worst - we may be stuck in the Pass and forced into the positional warfare that favors the German defenders. Try to break through, so that we'll get into the open landscape before weather worsens. The deeper you'll get, the better chance for a complete German collapse...

Reinforces: Well, this time your force is a reinforce. The 1st Czechoslovak Army Corps will be deployed into combat on the second day of operation. The 1st Guards Cavalry Corps will be deployed on the same day, its target is to check the western route through the mountains.

Hint: Be very careful with your advance. The terrain is confusing and the morning fog does not help with a proper reconnaisance. Don't lead your men into some trap...

Note: Campaign's scale changed once again and one unit represents a regiment now on.

Victory conditions: After fourteen turns hold four VHs for a BV, three for a V and two for a TV.
