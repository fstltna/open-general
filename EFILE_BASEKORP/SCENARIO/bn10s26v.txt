You have achieved all objectives, the mission was a complete success. Good work!

Our attack on Moscow is progressing well, the city is surrounded and another giant pocket has emerged. The Soviet counterattacks on the Volga River were stopped after short time or aborted by the enemy. The Russians now seem to have serious supply problems and fuel shortages, which greatly impairs the operational of their mobile forces and air force. Due to this development the further advance of your troops were ordered to northeast direction at Perm!
