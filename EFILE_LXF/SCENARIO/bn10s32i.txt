
SAVANNAH - 12 MAY 1943

East off Savannah, Georgia, United States

It's time! The training of the last months must pay off now. Our intelligence has done everything to make the enemy believe that our landing take place at Norfolk in the north. But even if this diversion bear fruit, it wait a difficult battle on you. The entire east coast of the United States from Maine to Florida was changed into a fortress. Your landing section is defended by two Infantry divisions, but many more are in the outback on standby. Let's hope that the enemy fails to bring these forces in time to the front.

GOAL: Take all VH's!
