General Seishiro Itagaki

What a shame Colonel, you were defeated!  The resistance was stronger than expected and the Chinese established a new strong defensive line.  Now the planned link up with our Chahar Expeditionary Force will be significantly delayed!   The General Staff has accepted your resignation!
