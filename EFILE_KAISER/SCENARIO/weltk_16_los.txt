Your delay at Bitola means that our victory in the Balkans will take longer and will be harder. At least the Bulgarians have won the day near the Doiran Lake and are ready to attack Thessaloniki. We still have a chance to take Athen, but we'd better choose an officer with more determination. Von Hutier will replace you, and you'll be sent to the Italian front, where I hope you'll show that you've learnt from your mistakes.
