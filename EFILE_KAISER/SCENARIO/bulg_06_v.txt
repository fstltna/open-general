A brilliant maneuver. You have nearly destroyed an entire Serbian division. But I'm afraid that I have bad news for you. The Greeks have routed our Second Army at Kukush, south of here, and Serbian reinforcements are coming from the north. You must retreat to your original lines, or you will be the one in danger of being outflanked.
