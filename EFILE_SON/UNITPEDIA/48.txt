The Hungarian word literally means “6-pounder Cannon”.

It is a Medium-Caliber Battery, with medium range, decent attack and weak defense values. It has three special skills: it can capture a flag hex, it can attack naval targets and it can use rail transport (RTP).

This field gun was the major artillety weapon of the Hungarian Army. At the beginnings of the Revolution only the 5th Artillery Regiment of the Austrian Army stationed in Hungary, with mostly Czech soldiers. They were loyal to the new Government till the end of the Indepence War. They had 60 pieces of 6-pdr guns. The most major fortresses (with the exception of Arad and Temesvár in South-Hungary) were handed over to the Hungarians in May 1848, and the Hungarian Army got another 120 6-pdr guns from the warehouses. The training of the newly recruited crew began in May 1848. Mostly engineers, university students or other well educated citizens volunteered. They learnt their new job so quickly and precisely, as Jellachic (the Austrian general commanding the Austro-Croatian Army in September 1848) wrote to the Austrian High Command that the Hungarian Army had French artillerymen in service.

The production of the new guns started in June 1848 in Buda (which was lost in December 1848), Nagyvárad (in the East-Central region) and in Székelyföld (Szeklerland). Until the end ow the Independence War, they created 130 new 6-pdr guns.
