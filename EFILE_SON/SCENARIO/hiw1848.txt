Hungarian Independence War 1848-49

Colonel! The Habsburg family encouraged the national minorities to rebel against our beloved country. We cannot trust the imperial troops resting on Hungarian soil and their leaders’ loyality is very low too. Jellachic, the Croatian governor crossed River Drava, the Hungarian border. Gather your men and save our Homeland and the new constitution we achieved this spring! Two words rise on our flags: “Homeland and Freedom”. But don’t forget the third one, written only in our hearts: “...or Death”! Fight as hard as you can, till the last breath. If we fail, there will be no mercy!
