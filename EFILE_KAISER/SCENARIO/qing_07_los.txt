Seymour's relief force never reached Peking. Although they actually defeated the Chinese soldiers, they suffered many casualties and Seymour, knowing that many more Chinese units awaited him in Peking, decided to end this adventure two weeks after it started. The Westerner sailors retreated to Tientsin, where they hoped that they'd receive reinforcements very soon. We regrouped and chased them, but not before my father in law assured me that, after expelling the foreign army from China, we'd send our troops against the Yihetuan.
