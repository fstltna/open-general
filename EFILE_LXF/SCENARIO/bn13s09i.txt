
GEMBLOUX  - 14 MAY 1940

The war is reaching its climax. The German Armies have reached the Meuse River and we are waiting for them. Your force is now part of the 1st Army under General Blanchard and have taken up positions in the so-called Gembloux gap, an excellent terrain for armoured warfare. We expect the German Panzer Divisions to launch their main attack here. To repulse them we have our Cavalry Corps in which we have concentrated two Division Legere Mecanique. 

A first encounter at the village of Hannut has resulted in no clear victory for either side. However many vehicles on both sides were lost. You will join with the remnants and the infantry at Gembloux. You must stop the German advance there. Vive la France!

GOAL: Take all VH's!
