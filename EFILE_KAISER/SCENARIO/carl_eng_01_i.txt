Eraúl

May 5th, 1873

Many things have changed in the last year. In Madrid Amadeo I abdicated, sick of the fact that even his top aides didn't pay the slightest attention to him. The foreign was suceeded by a republic, whose government is even more unpopular and weak.
While anarchy gripped our country, we have learned the lessons of Oroquieta. We have improved the preparation and equipping our soldiers, and finally the time has come to show the republican army that we can beat them in the open.
Since a few days ago a  republican column is chasing  throughout the region. At present it proceeds from Echávarri to Eraúl. But it has separated too much from the other  enemy columns, so we have a great opportunity to fight back and force them to surrender.

Victory conditions: Take all the VHs.

Note: Your troops still have less quality than the liberal ones. Advance with caution and remember that during the first 4 turns you'll still receive some prestige.
