The First World War - Sarrebourg - 20th, Aug. 1914 - BV

Général, your troops have beaten the Germans badly, but in the rest of Lorraine our offensive has stalled. The Boche will counterattack soon, so you must cancel your battle plans and cover our retreat. For the moment, our priority in Lorraine will be the defence of Nancy.

Don't feel frustrated. The Germans have been forced to commit more troops in Alsace and Lorraine than they had expected, so they haven't been able to reinforce their main offensive in Belgique as much as they needed. This will give us more chances of defeating them there.
