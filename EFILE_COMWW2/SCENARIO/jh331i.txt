Smolensk
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Herr General, our drive to Moscow has been quite successful, but enemy resistance continues to stiffen. You have been assigned with the task to capture the important river crossings along the Dniepr close to Smolensk. In doing so we might be able to surround and defeat a number of Soviet armies. However, our intelligence report that most of the bridges have been destroyed by the Soviets, and there are also troop movements that indicate that the enemy is trying to escape the encirclement by attacking our forces around Tolochin. Good luck, Herr General.
