   "I refuse, no Scorched Earth here". 11/29/39
  French Major Suett Dever Charles commanding the 17th and 20th Armee's statement to the French Command in Paris.The French HQ wanted everything destroyed in and around Rouen so the SS couldn't use it or shelter in it but the Major refused.He had seen enough hardships in the War already to be the one to cast what Civilians remained out in the cold and snow.Besides the SS/BdM had come prepared,they were dressed in fine Winter garb while the French overcoats and overshoes were wore out.The French soldier was more worried on getting something to eat this day as slowly the rations had been cut back to not enough to sustain the 17th or 20th,HQ in Pari was hoarding everything.You add displaced Persons begging for food and the matters got worst.Soldiers were starting to desert and Charles as the Command in Paris knew soon the numbers would be in the thousands.Morale non-existent, Air-superiority held by the Enemy and French Commanders giving orders,then retracting orders only to come back and give more ludicrious orders than the ones before.The French soldier looked for someone to step-up.There was no-one in the face of the SS 'Fraus assault.
