SITUATION:

Ah, Good day, Herr General! Please sit down and allow me to explain the present situation. Our capture of Rostov was short-lived, as fresh Bolshevik troops from Siberia forced our weary troops to evacuate the most eastern parts of the front. This spring we have decided to pursue a Southern strategy, capturing Stalingrad to serve as a base to strike towards either Moscow or the Baku oil fields. As part of this campaign you are directed to cross the Don.

ORDERS: 

Take all VHs in 13/17/21 turns for a BV/V/TV.

NOTES:

Two air-transports are available.
