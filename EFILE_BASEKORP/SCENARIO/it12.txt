OPERATION BATTLEAXE June15 1941

Operation Brevity showed that our front line defences were quite easily breached. Anticipating this new British attack and using the lessons learned from our attacks on Tobruk, Rommel created a line of fortified positions from Halfaya to Sidi Azeiz.

A weakness in the British 7 Armored Division's signals security informed us of an enemy attack 9 hours ago. The British attack is performed by elements of the 4th Indian division and the rebuild 7th Armored Division. Our sea and air forces were able to sink a ship with 57 tanks of the Tiger convoy, but the rest slipped though with 238 tanks and 43 Hurricanes. These are now used against us - without any doubt with the goal to reach Tobruk and possible to even push us back further than that point.

Note: This scenario has no initial deployment of core ground units.

News: Crete has fallen to our forces.
