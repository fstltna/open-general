
OPERATION DIADEM - 12 MAY 1944

The objectives of Operation Diadem are to advance on Rome, relieve the defenders of Anzio and prevent the retreat of German forces. The British 8th Army will cross the Rapido and advance up the Liri valley; British and Canadian elements will cross the Rapido and break out to the west, while the Polish 2nd Corps will directly assault Montecassino. You will spearhead the US 5th Army's attack; your Corps, together with elements of US 2nd Corps, will directly attack the German defenders on the southern part of the line - a decisive attack should force them to withdraw.

Your part in the offensive is vital; failure is not tolerable.

GOAL: Take all VH's!
