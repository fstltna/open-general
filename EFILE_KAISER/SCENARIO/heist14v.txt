Kindralmajor,

Your raid on Krasnaya Gorka has met success.  The rescued mutineers have provided valuable information to our fleet command regarding Soviet anti-shipping installations.  Furthermore, the presence of hastily conscripted units (Polk Bednoty was a regiment raised from homeless Petrograd men) is a clear indicator of the strain our offensive has caused the Red Army command.

We must push forward, Kindralmajor!
