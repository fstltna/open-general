15. MEMEL (10 October 1944)

TO: Grossadmiral
SUBJECT: Memel

---For the war in the East, the year 1944 has brought us the loss of the Ukraine, Russia, and most of the Baltics. This brings the Soviets near the borders of the German Reich. The most north-eastern city of the Reich, Memel, has recently been cut off from East Prussia and can now only be reached by either sea or air. The Fuhrer has ordered to hold Memel at all costs.

Elements of elite divisions have pulled back into the Memel Kessel and joined the Memel Volkssturm to defend the city. However the garrison needs reinforcements. Your Marine Corps will be used for that. Although your men are no match for heavy Soviet formations, the progress of the war leaves us no choice... Your ships will be of vital importance to hold back the Soviets. You are ordered to hold out with minimal losses to your own flotilla and Marine Corps units until the order comes to evacuate.---

NOTE: This scenario can only be lost. Goal is to play the full 18 turns and then simply lose, and you will continue to the next scenario. Try to keep as many core units as possible alive while trying to gain as much experience as possible.
