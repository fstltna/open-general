04. NARVIK 2 (1 June 1940)

TO: Kapitaen zur See
SUBJECT: Narvik

---Operation Weserubung was highly succesfull with securing Norway completely. However at Narvik the tide is turning. The Allies have landed an expeditionary force and repelled our Gebirgsjaeger from Narvik. Even more this Allied army is supported by a large British flotilla. It is vital to act quickly.

From your bases at Kiel you will steam to Narvik at full speed and destroy the British flotilla. We are unsure of the amount of Allied ships, but our Kriegsmarine is weakened after the losses of Weserubung and your flotilla is the best available. Your Marine Corps must help the Gebirgsjaeger to get control of the area back. Only then Norway will be fully German for the first time in history!---
