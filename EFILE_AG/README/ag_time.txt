...but its just a "rough guideline", if we must decide between gameplay and historical correctness, most time we choose gameplay.... so its for example much more interesting, if you can earn principes later in a cam, so you can upgrade your hastati to it, or earn it as prototype... last but not least, we are gamedesigners, no historicans...
