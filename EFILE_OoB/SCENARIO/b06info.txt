06. BUOI (1 April 1945)

Australian forces have almost reached the Bonis peninsula! First we will capture the village of Buoi on the western coast at the base of the peninsula. Furthermore you will have to embark one company of your battalion at Puto and let it move up the coast. The company must land at and capture Torokori Island off the coast of Boungainville. This small island is an ideal observation spot and must not be in Japanese hands. Good luck, commander!

NOTE: You can deploy one unit at Puto in the south. Move it to the PORT hex where you can embark the unit so it can set sail for Torokori Island. This is the ONLY way of capturing that victoryhex!
