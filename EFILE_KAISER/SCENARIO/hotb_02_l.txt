I can't believe that those pesky little Filipinos, with their poor training and even poorer equipment, have actually resisted our assaults and made us ask for reinforcements. They are astonishingly brave, that's for sure. We won't underestimate them again.

Anyway, when our reinforcements arrive the uprising will be crushed and the survivors will have to flee to the jungle and the mountains. 

I'm sure that they'll keep on fighting there. Winning this war will take some time, but we'll prevail. I'm starting to think that the Spaniards had so many problems with the Filipinos because they were too soft with them, but that won't happen to us. Most of the American generals that have come to this archipelago are veterans of the Indian wars. They know how to deal with stubborn native rebels that refuse to accept defeat.
