Battle of Ovche Pole

October 16th, 1915

Liberating Vardar Macedonia is an old Bulgarian aspiration that now you, commanding our 2nd Army, can finally make true.
Besides, a quick victory over the Serbians will have a positive strategical effect. Although Greece is, theoretically, a neutral country, there are already thousands of British and French troops there, who use Greece as a safe base for their operations in Gallipolli and the Balkans. The Greek goverment can't, or doesn't want to, do nothing against them.
Right now, those British and French troops are preparing themselves for helping Serbia. If you take your objectives quickly, the Serbian supply lines will be destroyed, and Britain and France won't be able to send any reinforcements to them. In that case, Serbia will be defeated before Christmas. 
We know that the Serbians are well fortified in Kumanovo ans Stip, but the rest of the area is virtually undefended. Good luck!

Victory conditions: Take all VHs.

Special notes: Now you can buy trucks for some of your units. That may help you to advance faster.
