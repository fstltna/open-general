VICTORY

The Hungarians are saved from disaster and are in debt to Germany for a long time from now on. The Czechs have no hope to reach the Tatra mountains in sufficient numbers to create a last defense. As we speak, elements of the Wehrmacht are securing the last parts of the former state of Czechoslovakia.

The war is won! In less than three months you and your men have gained experience from the highest ranks in the Army. Several times you have made the differance and have contributed a large part to this first victory of the German Army since the Great War! We will annexate Bohemia and Moravia. Slovakia will be semi-independant under German control. A few tiny parts are handed over to Hungary and Poland.

Once again the Germany Army is feared in Europe!
