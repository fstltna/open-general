The Battle of St.Margriete-Houtem - August 18th 1914

With Liege in our hands, the First Armee has now caught up with our cavalry that had bypassed Liege. 

With the Belgian 1st Cavalry Division on the Belgian Northern flank shaken, it is now time to hit the 1st Infantry Division just South of it, defending Tienen. A quick and successful attack here will push back the Belgian army before the French can fill the gap between the 4th Infantry Division at Namur - to your South East - and the rest of the Belgian Army that is in front of your forces. Taking the Belgian Army out of the picture will allow us to turn the First Armee South towards Paris.

III Corps will move on Tienen from the North-East and IX Corps will attack from the East. Your 4th Kavallerie Division will provide flank protection.
