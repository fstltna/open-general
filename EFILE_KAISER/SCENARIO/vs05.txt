Le Cateau - Gen. Smith Dorrien Makes a Stand - August 26th 1914

The British Expeditionary Force (BEF) is retreating South after the battle of Mons and Gen. Smith-Dorrien's II Corps gets separated from Gen. Haig's I Corps. When the exhausted II Corps is about to be overtaken by the German First Army, Smith-Dorrien decides to make a stand at Le Cateau. The German First Army is dispersed and only II Kavalerie Korps and IV Infantry Korps are in contact with II Corps of the BEF in the early morning of the 26th of August 1914.

Scouts of IV Korps reported BEF troops in Le Cateau. Your 4th Kavallerie Division is still part of II Kavallerie Corps that is protecting the First Armee's right flank. IV Infantry Korps units will arrive soon on your right flank.
