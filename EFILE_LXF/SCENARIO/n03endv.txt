Comrade General, have some water and rice.  You and our People's Army have performed admirably against an unequal foe.  While we are struggling to get supplies and men to the frontlines you have pushed back the Southern army and inflicted heavy casualties on the Americans but we still find ourselves in a stalemate.  Yes, eat as much rice as you wish, Comrade General.  We will build up our army and strike another day!
