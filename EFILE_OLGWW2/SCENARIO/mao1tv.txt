TACTICAL VICTORY

The uprising was successful and Nanchang is ours!  This has become the first major stronghold of Marxism in China.  Now it is time to create a Revolutionary Committee in this city to manage our goals.  We must get Soviet aid by sea with another uprising in Guangzhou.  Our comrades there will receive our support from Nanchang.
