April 14th, 1954
Shoreline of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Aerial reconnaissance has confirmed that there is a large camouflauged shipping operation off the coast of the Yucatan where the Germans are shipping in arms and supplies from the rest of Latin America.

We still don't know how they got here or what their purpose behind such a large military establishment is, but we do need you to take your troops and seize the ports here along the coast.  With their supplies disrupted, it should be easier to contain the German forces.

Naval support is en route, so keep an ear out on your radio for the USS Alaska.

Carter out.

SCENARIO NOTES:
* Take all German victory hexes to win.
