BACKGROUND

The French port at Brest was occupied on 18 June, 1940 by the German 5. Panzerdivision (5th Panzer Division). English troops destroyed just before most of the harbour facilities. But the Germans soon use Brest as base for surface raiders against merchant shipping in English Channel. Later the Germans maintained a large U-boat submarine base at Brest.
