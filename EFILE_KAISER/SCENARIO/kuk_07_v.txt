You've done your best. Our enemies are retreating again. Sadly, the price that we've paid is too high. We can't keep on defending the ruins of Görz and the shore of the river, we just don't have enough men for that any more. We must retreat to the mountains, and defend ourselves from higher ground. That means that the Italians will have a solid bridgehead, but there's nothing that we can do about it.

The current situation is bleak. In the east, Romania is going to enter the war, on Russia's side. Here, the only thing that we can do is to wait for the next Italian assault. Sooner or later, they'll find a way to breach our defence lines, especially if they choose a better commander.  I don't know what we're going to do. Well, I guess it could get better. In a war, things can change very suddenly.
