The Bolsheviks opposed a fierce resistance against our attacks. And here is where my story ends. During one of the assaults, I was badly wounded by an enemy grenade. The doctors could save my life, but I lost my left eye and part of my left leg. When I could leave the hospital, the war had already ended. The revolution was over and Russia had a new, bright future. But many people, including myself, had paid a terrible price for it.

I don't regret what I did, though. The Bolshevik menace is over. We have recovered our country. I have a home. Certainly, my life is hard, I can't do certain jobs, and my wounds hurt occasionally. But when the spring comes and I can go strolling on the shores of the Volga in Samara, I realise how lucky I am for being able to live in my beloved Russia, and I thank God for that. Our sacrifice has been worthwhile.
