BRILLIANT VICTORY

Congratulations comrade!  Korea is now entirely unified under the communist flag, and Kim-Il-Sung has been proclaimed chairman of the People's Republic of Korea at Seoul. This is an enormous victory for the communist world, there have also been celebrations at other communist capitals like Moscow, East-Berlin, and of course Beijing.

Now you are a hero for the People's Republic of China and for all the workers around the world.
