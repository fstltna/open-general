San Francisco - US Counterattack

August, 1943

Good morning general.  The enemy National Guard and those rookie soldiers weren't a problem for your elite warriors.  But now, we should take care, the Americans will send a lot of units to this sector with the aim of erasing us from US soil, we shall see.  Your mission is to capture San Francisco from the ground, and also seize San Jose.  We expect a direct attack on our beach head at Monterey and the arrival of the US navy, which will surely try to set a blockade... it, will be funny when the world biggest warship, our glorious battleship Yamato, arrives to deal with their vessels.

Defeat them at the sea, and stop their counterattack, we will then celebrate our victory at the negotiation tables of San Francisco!
