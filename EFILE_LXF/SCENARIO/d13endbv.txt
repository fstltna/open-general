BRILLIANT VICTORY

Excellent, General. Operation Product has been a stunning success. And with relative ease. However, much of the Indonesian Army is still conducting guerilla warfare. Keep patrolling and guarding your sector!

AFTERMATH:
Most of the economic important regions on Java were taken with relative ease by the Dutch Army in the so-called First Police Action. The name suggested a mere police action but in fact tens of thousands of troops were involved. Though succesfull at reaching its goals, the operation did not end the conflict between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Indonesia.
