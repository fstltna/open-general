09. SEVASTOPOL 1942 (6 June 1942)

Comrade, despite our initial successes in our Winter offensive, it has failed to defeat the fascist invaders. With the start of spring they have regained their iniative and at the moment are preparing a final assault on the fortress city of Sevastopol which is being cut off from our lines since last year. The Black Sea Fleet will transport your forces to Sevastopol where you will reinforce the defenses. The fascist attack is expected to start as we speak!

The garrison of Sevastopol has months of artillery and air bombardments survived, and repulsed already two fascist attacks to capture the port. Our forces are exhausted and not many reinforcements can be send. Supplies are hard to deliver. You must hold out for at least 15 days. Then Stavka will decide what to do next. Good luck, comrade.

NOTE: You can only lose this scenario. Goal is to play the full 15 turns and keeping your core alive. Then the scenario will end and you will continue to the next scenario!

NOTE: There is nothing to win, so do not hesitate to retreat to better defensive positions. Be sure to cover your forces with artillery and keep the artillery resupplied. They are vital for the survival of your units.
