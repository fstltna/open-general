"Dear Otto, my beloved brother in faith!

I'm shocked and saddened to realize that I must be the first to unravel the true depths of the tragedy that affected your family. I can't understand why everybody (Karl-Hans, dr. Braunheld to name few...) hid the verity before your eyes, so it will be me to have the dubious honour of being the messenger of bad news.

Yes, the girl is alright. She's very tiny, of course, because Sophie gave birth prematurely because of the shock. But the doctors told that the baby will be (hopefully!) alright. But now I see that they were silent about Sophie alone.

Otto, on the night of the air raid, the Brits were using incendiary bombs and one of them hit your house. The phosphorus adhered to Sophies hair and soiled her face, and... you know. Thank God that she didn't lost her sight. But she's still in a serious danger...

Otto, I know that this may sound like the usual Christian jargon and I really wish that it wasn't me who must undergo this all. But please, before you throw away the letter and before you refuse my requests, think about them just for a while.

The beauty of your daughter's mortal body is possibly destroyed, but the beauty of her immortal soul is untouched. I'll pray for her and I'll try to help her as much as possible. Keep your faith and hope!

Whatever happens, don't do any deed of evil. Revenge on an innocent Russian civilians or captured soldiers won't help her in any way, but it will hurt many people, including you yourself.

Be strong.

Yours in Christ:

Johann"
