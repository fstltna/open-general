1950-51 NORTH KOREAN CAMPAIGN

Korea has been in the hands of foreign powers for far too long.  The Imperialist Japanese have been driven off our peninsula only to make room for capitalistic Americans - but only in the south.  The people of North Korea have the full support from our comrades in the Soviet Union. They have supplied us with weapons, trucks, artillery, mortars, and their famous T-34 tanks!  Now the time has to come to unite Korea under the communist banner and free the people of South Korea from their capitalistic oppressors!!!

Take Command of North Korean units from Seoul to the Naktong River.  Fight at the Pusan Perimeter and retreat all the way across the peninsula when General MacArthur's troops land at Inch'on and threaten to cut you off.  Once complete defeat looked like the only option and then the Chinese intervene and drive the United Nations troops south.  Lead guerrilla activity behind enemy lines while your force is being refitted.  Then again command your units alongside our Chinese allies to try once more to liberate South Korea.  In the summer of 1951 the major powers decide the fate of Korea by starting to negotiate a truce...
