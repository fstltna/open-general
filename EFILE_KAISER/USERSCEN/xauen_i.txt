Advance into Xauen

September 20, 1920

Spain's alliance with El Raisuli proved to be weak. After the WWI there was a new period of unrest in northern Morocco. Determined to put an end to El Raisuli´s insurgence, general Berenguer decided to take the Berber strongholds on the Djebala and Gomara mountains. The main objective would be the holy town of Xauen, a religious center for the Moroccan people. The taking of Xauen by the Spanish army would be a great blow for the morale of the rebels and for El Raisuli's prestige, and the Spanish victory in Morocco would be much closer.
