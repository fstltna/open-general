HQ 8th NKVD Rife Brigade, Estonia
CO General Kuznetsov

It does not look good for us, Comrade! The Germans stand at the Estonian border and all over crawled Bandits out of their holes. Minutes ago, I was informed about a upcoming guerrilla attack. It seems the Estonian Forest Brothers try to free some of their guerrilla fighters from her imprisonment. A Estonian commando, flown in from Finland lead the operation.

Order: Protect our prison building, search & destroy the ERNA commando and all Bandits!
