You and your volunteers of Ist and IInd Battalions of Panzer Regiment 6 of 3.Panzer Division have formed Grupe Drohne and have been training Spanish Nationalist tank forces for a few weeks now. The troops under command of General Varela have conquered the Casa de Campo after a bloddy battle and are now ready to enter Madrid through the university area. 

ORDERS
