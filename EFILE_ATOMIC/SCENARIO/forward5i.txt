Pocket of Kiev
Herr General, the situation is very awkward. Your troops are threatened by encirclement. Western of Kiev, the 6. Army is attacking your positions. From the north the Panzergruppe 2 will show up every moment in the back of your positions and they will join with the advance guard of the 17. Army. Hold Kiev and the surrounding regions as long as possible, so that we have the possibility to bind German troops.
Your troops:
Parts of the 37. Army are subordinate to your authority. These troops are wet behind the ears and do not have much tanks, but some artillery with big caliber.
Enemy troops:
The Germans proceed in the west with many tanks and infantry. The Panzergruppe 2 and the advance guard of the 17. Army are completely motorized and have mainly Panzer II and Panzer III tanks.
Sgn. Major Heinz
