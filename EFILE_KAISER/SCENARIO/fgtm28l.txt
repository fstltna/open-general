The Austrian and German forces enjoyed a serious advantage in manpower:  mustering 357,400 men for the overall offensive (with 126,000 in the immediate viscinity of Gorlice and Tarnow), our 3rd Army could counter with 219,000 men (with 60,000 in the immediate viscinity of the towns).  Achieving a breakthrough of 16 km wide and 4 deep within three days of the attack, Falkenhayn had achieved the first breakthrough of a static front in WWI.  The German OHL had envisioned this breakthrough to be the opening to the Cannae pincer maneuver on a grand scale against our 3rd (Lesch), 4th (Evert), and the newly-formed 13th (Gorbatovsky) Armies deployed in Poland.
