12/16/1939   A Night In Sortavala

First, your troops shall get some rest...No wait! Sorry, new orders.
Situation report: Your troops should take a little rest at Sortavala, but some Soviet troops have broken through and are threatening our supply-lines.
Enemy: The 34th Tank division, an unidentified Cavalry division and an unknown number of patrols.
Our forces: Your group and the local defense-forces. We have built extensive fortifications. 

You have to hold Sortavala (hex 09, 22) and must open the supply-lines for my corps (hex 20, 18). If Sortavala falls my corps is cut off and you know what that will mean...
At this very moment a huge air fleet is closing in on Sortavala.  Make sure to have enough air-defense.
