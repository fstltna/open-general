BACKGROUND

The Bombardment of Cherbourg was a naval attack by ships of the United States Navy and Royal Navy on June 25, 1944, in support of United States Army units engaged in the Battle of Cherbourg. The Allied force attacked German fortifications near and in the city. They engaged in a series of duels with coastal batteries, and provided close infantry support.

Allied reports agreed that the most effective naval gunnery was small ship direct fire support of infantry. While the bombardment force's heavy guns neutralized twenty-two of twenty-four assigned navy targets, none were destroyed; German batteries were eliminated as a threat when the infantry captured them. Rapid infantry assaults ensured the guns could not be reactivated. When the city fell, the neutralized casemated guns, which the Germans could have turned inland towards advancing Allied troops, still pointed out to sea.
