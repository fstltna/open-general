Victory! The liberals have come up against our defenses and they are retreating southwards. They have also lost General Concha, who was killed by one of our shots. Although an  enemy, he was a capable and courageous man. We will pray for him.
Unfortunately we can not take advantage of this victory, because the republican army outnumbers us. We can only hope for a miracle and that the political situation in Spain changes favorably to our interests.
