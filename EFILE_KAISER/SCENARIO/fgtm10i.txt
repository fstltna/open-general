Gnila Lipa, 27 Aug 1914
Gospodin General-Major, your division is now part of the VIII Corps, 8th Army (Brusilov).  The opening engagement of the war with Austria-Hungary had occured at the Zlota Lipa river, where the Austrian 3rd Army (Brudermann) has been repulsed.  The Austrian armies have launched an offensive along the entire frontier, and their center 4th Army has gained some ground.  Generals Ruzsky (3rd) and Brusilov (8th) hope to collapse the Austrian right flank and threaten their center.

You will participate in the counterattack with the objective of forcing the Gnila Lipa river and opening the way to capture the Austrian fortress of Lemberg.  The Kiev military district is designated as the primary mobilization district, and you can plan on receiving ample reinforcements for this battle.  You should also be aware that the Austrians have begun redeploying one of their Balkan armies (2nd) to assist in their offensive.
