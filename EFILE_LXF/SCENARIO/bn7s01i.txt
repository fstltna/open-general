CO Admiral Bertram H. Ramsay

Protect the Dunkirk evacuation fleet from attacking enemy naval and air forces, especially submarines and motor torpedo boats.

Eight MSU's have to reach the port of Dover (escape points) and not more than five MSU's should be sunk by the Germans. Another Sloop, HMS Londonderry is subject to your command. Congratulations!


THE STORY

The Dunkirk evacuation, code-named Operation Dynamo, also known as the Miracle of Dunkirk, was the evacuation of Allied soldiers from the beaches and harbour of Dunkirk, France, between 27 May and 4 June 1940. The operation became necessary when large numbers of British, French, and Belgian troops were cut off and surrounded by the German army during the Battle of France in World War II. In a speech to the House of Commons, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill called the events in France "a colossal military disaster", saying that "the whole root and core and brain of the British Army" had been stranded at Dunkirk and seemed about to perish or be captured. In his We shall fight on the beaches speech on 4 June, he hailed their rescue as a "miracle of deliverance".
