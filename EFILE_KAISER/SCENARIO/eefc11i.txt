Jerusalem, 30th December 1917
-------------------------------------------------
General, the orders for the final assault on Jerusalem have been given!

While 60th and 74th Division will attack the Turkish defensive line along the Wadi Surar, your mounted troops will have to hold Turkish reinforcements at bay which are approaching the theatre from the north all along the Suffa-Foka-Tahta-Line. Furthermore, it is recommended that you use your infantry to secure our position at Nebi Samwil.

Lloyd George has asked "The Bull" to present him Jerusalem for Christmas...

NOTE: You will be able to buy experienced units in this scenario.
