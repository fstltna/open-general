Hoa Moc

Mar 2nd, 1885

In order to relieve Tuyen Quang the French had to cross the Yu Oc gorge, near the village of Hoa Moc. That position was easy to defend, with hills on one flank and the Lo river on the other, so our enemies would be forced to make a frontal attack. If the Chinese fought like they had done in the past battles, I was confident that the French brigade would be destroyed.

Victory conditions:
- Destroy 23 enemy units.
