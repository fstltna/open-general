Brussilow Offensive: Kowel

Jul 24th, 1916

Welcome to the Eastern Front, General. It's frustrating after all of your efforts at Verdun, but it seems that the Russians and the British have finally come to the rescue of France. The Russian offensive, planned by Alexei Brussilow, has been the most surprising initiative that we've seen in years. It's pierced the seemingly strong Austro-Hungarian defences like a hot knife through butter, and now our allies desperately need our help. That's the reason why you're here. 

The next step of the Russians offensive is the taking of Kowel, in Wolynien. However, now that they've concentrated a large number of troops in the area, they seem to be reverting to the tactic of human wave assaults that have been so unsuccessful since the war started. So, even though we're at a disadvantage, we have a real chance to stop the Russians here.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.

Special notes: 

- You can buy Austro-Hungarian equipment in this scenario.

- In this scenario the "skip first player turn" option is activated.
