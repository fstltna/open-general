With the armistice between the Axis Powers and Russia settled it's time to drive the Allies out of the Middle East.  In Persia Bandar-e-Abbas is an important Harbour and controls the Strait of Hormuz.  If we can beat the Allies at this point the war should be over soon.  Our Axis partners Germany and Italy send some troops from Iraq to support your offensive, the GREEN DEVILS and the LEGIONS OF IL DUCE.
