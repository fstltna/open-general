Dear Italian comrades.....

It is with a heavy heart that I report of your General's death and of great losses sustained by your nation's people.  

We fought the Russians with all our might, yet not even your greatfully received men could stem the red tide of Soviets as they pushed farther into my homeland.

You can be proud of your men.  As your commanding general died on a snow bank - his deputy took command to salvage the situation as best he could.  We left many of our sons in the snow drifts so desperate was the battle.

I am grateful of your promises to send reinforcements, the few men that managed to retire with my Finns are such heroes as they long for revenge!  We Shall overcome this setback!
