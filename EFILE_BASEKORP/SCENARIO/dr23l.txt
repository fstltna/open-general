The Fourth Battle of Kharkov - August 1943 L
A complete failure. You lost Kharkov and Russian advances North and South of the city force us to retreat to the Dnepr. Most of your forces are sent to France for rest and refit. Only a Kampfgruppe will remain on the Eastern front until the spring of 1944.
