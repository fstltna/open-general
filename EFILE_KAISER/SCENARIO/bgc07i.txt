Scimitar Hill - 21/08/1915
----------------------------------------
General, we are going to renew our offensive here at Suvla Bay. For this purpose, we have been reinforced by dismounted Yeomanry of the 2nd Mounted Divsion, which will be our reserve for this attack. Your 29th Division and 11th Division have been given the order to storm Scimitar Hill and the heights of Ismail Oglu Tepe, also called the "W Hills". The enemy on these hills is heavily entrenched and has used the last quiet days on this part of the front to build a formidable defence position that will be a hard nut to crack. Nevertheless, we have to take these heights if any real progress is to be made. 

Good luck, General!
