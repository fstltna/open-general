Struggle For The Bridgeheads - Goeritz

02/08/1945

The 1st Guards Tank Army's vanguards arrived at Goeritz south of Kuestrin on  February 1st and immeddiately established some small bridgeheads which they widened and united into a larger one over the next few days. German counter measures were ineffective because the only formation in that area was the 'Raegener' Division - a hodgepodge of replacement units, remnants and other units of doubtfull quality. Only by February 3rd and 4th, 'Kurmark' arrived and stabilized the front.

8 deploy hexes. New units have strength 8 and experience 75. You have to hold all three (3) victory hexes for a BV, two (2) for a V and one (1) for a TV.
