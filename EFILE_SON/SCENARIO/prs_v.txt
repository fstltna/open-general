Early in 1763, all belligerents made peace. The treaties of Paris and Hubertusburg put an end to a conflict which left the political map of Europe unchanged but the mere fact that Prussia survived this war is also a feat in itself. Prussia had survived the war and had even managed to keep Silesia despite the enormous difficulties it faced. Frederick II had become a popular hero and Prussia had asserted its status as a major continental military power and had become one of the most important European countries, even competing with Austria for influence at the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire.
