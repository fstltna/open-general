Situation report: The failure of the Japanese assault has left them in a weakened condition. Their commander has reportedly told Tokyo that he will fight to the last man. Our troops are poised for a strike on Madang and the harbor facilities in its vicinity. We are concerned, however, with the Japanese commander's resolve. 

Operational orders: The target for our next operation is Madang and the other facilities along the coast. The enemy is weakened, but is still quite strong in some areas. This will be no easy task. Because the Japanese plan to fight to the last, you should expect them to launch Banzai charges if our attack proves successful.
