Invasion of Crete

Part 3/3 of the "In der Wueste und auf Kreta" minicampaign


"Herr General, I got important news. We've just got a message from nearby airfield. Seems like one of our units hold it, but they've been cut off for several days! I don't understand why the Luftwaffe cannot help them, namely now when we have total control over the airspace above the island. However, they radioed that they start to lack everything from water, ammunition to morale and that they have great losses. 

So, here's the map. We must move through enemy territory. Scouts say that there are lots of British and Greek units all around, many of them disorganized, but others are still in good shape. And the local people joined the battle, too! I can't understand how on earth those paratroopers could hold the airfield for nearly a week.



Victory Condition: Capture the enemy VHs. Don't lose the paratroopers holding the SE airfield!

Hint: Defenders airforce is annihilated and his air defense is close to none. Your planes may roam free without any fear of interception.
On the other hand, the region is crawling with lots of enemy ground units including irregular troops with great knowledge of terrain.
You must hold the initial airfield... Hurry up, before the paratroopers are defeated.

Warning: This scenario uses limited deployment, use the "View the Strategic Map" feature first!
