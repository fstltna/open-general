Excellent work general!
Historical Note: Operation Overlord, of which the landing at Juno Beach was a part, was only one step of a global strategic plan for the complete defeat of Nazi Germany. The Normandy landings were designed to establish  bridgeheads from which two armies, the First US Army on the west flank and the Second British Army to the east could be supplied by sea. With the bridgeheads firmly secured, the armies were to move on to liberate France and the neighbouring countries. Germany, attacked on three separate fronts, in Northwest Europe, in Russia, and in the Mediterranean, would soon be exhausted and defeated. As D-Day drew to an end, the Canadians had managed to advance quite deeply towards Creully, Colomby-sur-Thaon and Anisy, short of their assigned target of Carpiquet Airfield, but far enough to make the operation a definite success....
