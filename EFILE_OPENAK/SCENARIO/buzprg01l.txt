After two days of hard fighting the 1st Czechoslovak Independent Field Battalion still held the village. But as the German ring around Kharkov was closing, nothing could be done to prevent the withdrawal. Czechoslovaks left the positions in good order, but leaving no less than one hundred fallen and many others wounded. But the Germans also payed the price, they've lost three to four hundred of men and more than twenty armoured vehicles from some fourty to sixty deployed.

Despite the victorious outcome, battle of Sokolovo could easily end the other way around. It is rather known fact that the supporting tanks were ordered into the thawing river Mzha, where the first one of them drowned. Also the connection with the 1st company was lost and this cost many lives. After all those years it is too hard to judge what exactly happened and where the mistakes were done...

However, Sokolovo became a symbol of Czechoslovak will to fight. Many soldiers were awarded Soviet orders, most notably the second lieutenant Otakar Jaros, who was (as a first foreigner ever) awarded the Gold Star of "Hero of Soviet Union" medal in memoriam.
