02. Syrian Adventure (22 June 1941)

After your voyage across the Mediterranean you arrived at the French colony of Syria.  With the French surrender you and your men fled Syria and concentrated in Palestine, which is under British control.

France has surrendered and now is neutral again while keeping its colonies.  The new regime, known as Vichy France, has friendly ties with our sworn enemy Germany.  During the Iraqi uprising German planes were allowed to refuel in Vichy French Syria. Our British allies cannot accept this and have started the invasion of Vichy French Syria and Lebanon, code named Operation Exporter.

Your force is part of the British 23rd Infantry Brigade which has been held in reserve until now.  The Syrian capital of Damascus has fallen and the British will concentrate on capturing Lebanon where the French still defend stubbornly.  The 23rd Infantry Brigade will assume responsibility over Damascus and pursue the remnants of the French defenders deeper into Syria.  You will assist the British troops in that pursuit.

HINT:  It would be wise to motorize your units.
