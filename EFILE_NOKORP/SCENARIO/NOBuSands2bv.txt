Excellent work. Let me be the first to congratulate you on your promotion, Generalleutnant!

Chances are the British will be counterattacking soon, but your presence is needed in Germany right now, as we prepare operation Barbarossa.

Move your troops to Tripoli so they can rest before they are shipped back. The Italians should be able to contain the British on their own, even if they lose some terrain; You are needed on the eastern front.
