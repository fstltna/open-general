11. BUJANOVCE (11 November 1944)

To the commanding officer of 22. ID (LL):

Heersgruppe E is retreating towards Croatia and your division will once again be its rearguard and defend the lines of retreat from attacks from the east as well as from partisan actions.

Recently Bulgarian troops have captured the important town of Bujanovce through which one of the few still existing roads goes. You have orders to immediately conduct a counterattack and take up positions in the vicinity of Bujanovce and hold these positions for at least ten days. Enemy resistance is expected to be heavy.


RULES: 
- Do not upgrade, sell or buy units - nor upgrading transports.
- Replacing lost units by buying new units is allowed. Replacements should be the exact same unit as the lost unit. Infantry units must be replaced by "Volksgrenadiere" units.
