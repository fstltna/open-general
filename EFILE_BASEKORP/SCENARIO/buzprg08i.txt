Jaslo

Part 3/7 of the "Commanding the Corps" minicampaign.

*****

The heavy fights during the end of the year 1944 and the related high losses forced Czechoslovaks to come into defense. Their numbers increased after conscriptions on liberated ground... but well, fate of Subcarpathian Ruthenia showed that "liberation" is too strong of a word...

In the meantime, Czechoslovaks were ordered to send most of their artillery plus two tank platoons to support the Jaslo operation....

Intelligence and reconnaisance: 320th and 545th Volksgrenadier Divisions and units of XI. SS Army Corps are entrenched on the approaches to the city. They are supported by few artillery batteries and several StuGs and rocket launchers.

Reinforces: None.

Hint: This is once again a smaller scenario, yet it is quite crowded. Although there were mainly artillery forces at Jaslo, you may wish to place mostly the tanks.
Be careful of little but experienced force of enemy fighters!

Victory conditions: After six turns hold five VHs for a BV, four for a V and three for a TV.

Warning: This scenario uses quite a limited deployment, use the "View the Strategic Map" feature first!
