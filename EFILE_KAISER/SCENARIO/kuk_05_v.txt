Everything is going as planned. Now you can advance towards Podgorica. The capital will fall without a fight, since the Montenegrin army has nothing left to fight with.

Soon we'll occupy most of Albania. However, no matter how much we hurry, many Serbian soldiers will have enough time to embark on the coast, and they'll leave for Corfu or continental Greece. It doesn't matter. This has been our finest victory since the war started. Serbia has been destroyed, we control most of the Balkans, and the Bulgarians are strong enough to do most of the future fighting in this area. Now we can focus on the Eastern front, and on the war against Italy.
