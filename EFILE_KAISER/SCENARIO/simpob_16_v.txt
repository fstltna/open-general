Our victory was complete. The Polish were routed, and they retreated so fast that I think we could have reached Warsaw in a few weeks if we had wanted to. Instead, we contented ourselves with the liberation of most of Belarus and Ukraine and with reasonable war reparations. The Poles agreed to our conditions, and both sides signed a peace treaty in Minsk in June 1920.

Russia had nearlly collapsed during those chaotic years, but in the end we managed to salvage most of our country. Since then we have worked hard to improve Russia and its people, rejecting all marxist ideas. There is still a lot left to do, and many unsolved problems, but at least we have hope in the future. May God help Russia and her rulers, so our country can thrive and we never engage again in nightmarish civil wars.

The campaign is over. I hope you've liked it and thanks for playing.
