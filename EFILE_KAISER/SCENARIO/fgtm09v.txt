Gospodin General-Major, your valiant defense of Lodz has allowed our 2nd and 5th armies to retreat toward Warsaw, maintaining the integritiy of their supply lines intact.  Thus ends the 1914 campaign for the North-Western Front:  having failed to achieve the strategic objectives of the Wistula River and Koenigsberg, the Front line has been drawn across Prussian lands southwest to the Polish salient and then along the Carpathian Mountains, deep into Austro-Hungarian territory.

The 2nd Army's tragedy in Prussia has been offset by an Austro-Hungarian tragedy of greater porportions:  from the fortress of Przemysl to the slopes of the Carpathian Mountains, our troops have carried victory across the Galician plain.  Using the Polish salient as its springboard, the North-Western Front will prepare an offensive into German Silesia for the coming year of 1915.
