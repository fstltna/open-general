Situation report: Our victories in the mountains have really hurt the Japanese. Intelligence reports that high level discussions are now going on in Tokyo regarding the situation in New Guinea. It is likely that more troops will be sent to reinforce the remaining Japanese around Buna and Gona. If we can successfully drive the Japanese out now, before reinforcements can be sent, will will achieve a great victory.

Operational orders: The airfields and port facilities around Buna and Gona are our main strategic targets. Our American Allies are sending in units from the south and we will advance from our positions along the mountain trails. There are still plenty of Japanese left in the region so be very wary of attacks that may occur on your flanks.
