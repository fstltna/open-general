BACKGROUND

On June 12, 1944, U.S. carriers started a series of air strikes on the Marianas, convincing Admiral Toyoda that the U.S. was preparing to invade. This move came as a surprise; the Japanese had expected the next U.S. target to be farther to the south, either the Carolines or the Palaus, and had protected the Marianas with only 50 land-based aircraft. On June 13, U.S. forces began bombardment operations for the coming invasion of Saipan.

Since control of the Marianas would place the Japanese home islands in range of the new American B-29 Superfortress strategic bombers, the IJN decided that the time for the long-awaited Kantai Kessen (decisive battle) had arrived. Toyoda immediately ordered a fleet-based counterattack, which would commit nearly all of the Japanese navy's serviceable ships to the coming engagement.

The Japanese fleet, commanded by Vice-Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa, consisted of three large fleet carriers (Taiho, Shokaku, and Zuikaku), two converted carriers (Junyo and Hiyo), four light carriers (Ryuho, Chitose, Chiyoda, and Zuiho), five battleships (Yamato, Musashi, Kongo, Haruna and Nagato), 13 heavy cruisers, 6 light cruisers, 27 destroyers, six oilers, and 24 submarines. The main portions of the fleet rendezvoused on June 16 in the western part of the Philippine Sea and completed refueling on June 17.
