So far everything has gone well. Maybe too much. It's surprising how poorly defended the French forts were. Besides, there haven' been any serious counterattacks. Where are the French? Our intelligence suggests that most of them have been killed, but I agree with you. It's likely that they are regrouping and preparing themselves to defend as many strategic positions as they can. 
But that isn't our worst problem. That one, paradoxically, has been caused by our own artillery. The bombardment has been so heavy that the terrain has become impracticable. Our troops can hardly move on the conquered ground, and they won't be able to take all the relevant defensive points before the French reinforcements arrive. So when the enemy deploys its reserves, our own soldiers will be exposed to artillery fire, too. They won't be safe and we'll suffer many casualties.
