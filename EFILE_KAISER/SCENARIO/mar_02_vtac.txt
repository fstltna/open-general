Message from General Fernández Silvestre's HQ:

The attack was greater than we expected, but you defended Alcazarquivir brilliantly and the enemy hordes have fled the battlefield. Well done, General! With this sort of action we will force El Raisuli's men to take refuge in the mountains, far from the coastal road to Tangiers and from the fertile crop fields of the Lucus Valley. Anyway, this defeat won't stop El Raisuli. If I know this man, he will plan future actions agains us. 

You should take a rest, General. In the future you will have to fight still better, in order to stop El Raisuli once and for all.
