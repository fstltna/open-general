General,

Due to your ineptitude the Germans have managed to create several bridgeheads over the Escaut and the Terneuzen Canal and are ready to penetrate our defensive line.

A new mission is waiting for you. Go to the canteen and let's hope you are able to cook a good "Gegratineerd witloof".

Le Chef d'Etat-major général de l’armée (EMGA).

Historical note:

On the 20th of May three German divisions went over on the attack at Zelzate, Kwatrecht and Zingem. After some initial success, Belgians immediately started several counterattacks regaining most of the ground previously lost. All German attacks were repelled on the Belgian front and the Germans weren’t able to create bridgeheads over the Escaut and the Terneuzen Canal. Belgian command was confident that the Germans could be stopped at the Schelde/Escaut.

However, when the Germans shifted its attention towards the British in the south they created in the sector of the 44th Infantry division a bridgehead o over the Schelde/ Escaut, which could be used as a base for future actions.
