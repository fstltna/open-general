Landing at Tanga

November 3, 1914

The british were sure that German East Africa would fall with just one blow. They decided to make a coordinated assault that included an amphibious landing in the german port of Tanga. The force was assembled in India and transported by ship to his destination. Upon arrival, the seasick indian troops were landed at afternoon in a beach some miles east from the city, believing that the port was mined.
The following day the landing continued and, when more soldiers were ready, the advance to the city started, in the belief that the germans had fleed.
The germans hadn't fleed, but were reinforced thanks to a carefull railway planning and the 48 hours that the attacking force had wasted, and when the british arrived in sight of the city they were greeted by a devastating fire...

Aftermath: After a hard fight, the germans stopped the british attack and forced them to reembark leaving more than 800 casualties, against about 50 dead in the german side. Also many war supplies were abandoned: enough english rifles to equip three askari companies, 600.000 rounds and 16 machineguns. Besides, the native soldiers learned that they could defeat an european army. The defeat cost Major-General Aitken his command.

Victory conditions: Hold 3 VHs to a BV, 2 to a V, and 1 to a TV. If you loose Tanga before turn 5 the british wins.
