Port Said is the northern entry to the Suez canal. Beware, it's well defended, the terrain is not favorable, and the area to secure is vast. We politely declined the help offered by our friends the Italians, because their participation would allow them to think they have earned rights on this region. The Suez canal is to become German, and only German.
But you do need more land troops to cover the terrain, and to hold it once it is conquered, so we have pulled an motorized infantry division from Greece. They were supposed to arrive at the same time as you, but the British fleet roving around has forced us to delay them. They will arrive tomorrow, but don't wait for them, you won't have too much time before more British troops arrive from the south. You should gain a foothold and clear a beachhead for the infantry division to land. You don't want them to be blocked in the sand, do you.


Instructions: Capture all VHs. Your reinforcements will arrive in turn 4, British reinforcements of unknown strength might arrive at some point.
