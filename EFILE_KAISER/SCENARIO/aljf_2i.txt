13. 6. 1849, The Palataine Uprising


Lieber Freund,

...this is the opportunity, we have been waiting for: the Palatains continue the Fight for the Republic, and we have joined them.
The Prussians have send some of their best troops, but in our hearts is still burning a hot flame of freedom....
Vivat the german Republic !


ORDERS:
Herr General, this becomes a hard battle, we have to defend the revolution against the famous Prussian army....
Reinforces from every liberated city will join our Revolution army.
Liberate and defend the Land !

TAKE ALL VH's

ADVICE FROM YOUR OLDEST SERGEANT:
Herr General, we have no chance in the open field, stay in the hills and let them come....
...Try to flank the enemy artillery, and destroy them at first!
...keep in mind, that men from every liberated city will join our army...
And it seems, there are no enemies in the West...
