At Krasnoyarsk we found some wagons and other vehicles that we used to advance faster without having to split our forces. We wanted to reach Irkutsk, where Kolchak was supposedly waiting for us. Then we could cross the Baikal and build a new line of defense.

But then, when we were very close to our destination, we learnt that there had been another Socialist-Revolutionary uprising in Irkutsk. The Czechs, pretending to be looking for a peaceful solution, had captured Kolchak and they were determined to hand him over to anyone who could grant them a safe passage to Vladivostok. Our garrisons and the cossack volunteers had been defeated by the Socialists or had switched sides. We were Kolchak's last and only hope. Kappel ordered us to go faster. We had to arrive in Irkutsk before it was too late.
