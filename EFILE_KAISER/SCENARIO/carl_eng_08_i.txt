Lácar

February 3rd, 1875

The political situation is increasingly unfavorable for us. In December General Martinez Campos proclaimed Alfonso, Infanta Isabel's son, King of Spain, and he is getting more and more supporters, including prominent traditionalists. The war in Cataluña is almost lost, and new recruits fill the ranks of the liberal army, more and more numerous.
The enemy is determined to take Estella and put us to an end, and three army corps have been mobilized for this purpose. The second one has broken our line of defense, but it has lost touch with the other two, entering too much in our territory. That gives us an opportunity to counterattack, defeat them and tecover the lost teritory. Good Luck!

Victory conditions: Take all the VHs.

Notes: - The unit that takes Lorca will win a leader.
            - The unit that takes Lácar will win +100 pex.
