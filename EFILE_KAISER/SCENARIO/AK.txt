When the WWI started, the German Empire didn't have any unit which was specialized in mountain warfare. After suffering greatly at the hands of the French Chasseurs Alpins during the first moths of the conflict, and witnessing the effectiveness of the Austrian Kaiserschützen, the Germans decided to create a similar force.

That was how, in May 1915, they joined several Bavarian and Prussian Jaeger and Guards battalions to create three mountain infantry regiments with their own artillery, machine guns, and even aviation. The Alpenkorps was born, and soon it became one of the best known and most feared German units of the Great War.

The new elite division fought in the Alps, the Balkans, the West Front and Romania, achieving incredible feats and earning the respect of its enemies. Those soldiers, wearing the Edelweiss as their insignia, wrote some of the most glorious pages of the history of German military and, even though the division disbanded after the end of the WWI, its legend is remembered even today.

This short campaign (10 scenarios) tells the tale of those brave men who fought for their country more than 100 years ago. Will you lead them, not to victory, but to eternity?
