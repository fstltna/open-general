Ah there you are, Comrade General.  You need to eat something.  I have heard about your actions at Majon-ni.  The capitalists have suffered many losses and as you have experienced, the Chinese comrades are pushing south with great success!  Travel with me to P'yongyang where your force is waiting for you!

AFTERMATH

Ever since the North Korean retreat from the Pusan Perimeter, pockets of North Korean forces had continued to resist even when they found themselves deep inside enemy held territory.  The US IX Corps was deployed behind the frontline to maintain security in the interior.  Guerilla activity continued for months.

The United Nations offensive ground to a halt due to severe supply problems and over-extending its forces on too broad a front.  Between 14 October and 1 November nearly 180,000 Chinese troops crossed the Chinese-Korean border and more were to follow. They first engaged UN troops in skirmishes but in late November the full might of the expeditionary Chinese Liberation Army fell on the UN troops.  This was followed by the longest retreat in United States military history.
