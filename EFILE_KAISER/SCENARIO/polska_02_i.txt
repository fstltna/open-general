Go East!

May 15th, 1915

The autumn of 1914 and the winter of 1915 were terrible for Austro-Hungary, but even worse for Russia. The Russian Army sustained enormous casualties, especially among the officers, and could not reach their goals. In the spring of 1915, the Austro-Hungarian Empire struck back. After the battle of Gorlice, Russian forces fled. They abandoned not only the Austro-Hungarian territory, but also the whole Kingdom of Poland. 
Legiony Polskie was reorganized. The 1st Brigade under brygadier Pi³sudski attacked the Russians from the west, while the 2nd Brigade attacked from the south. Meanwhile, volunteers created the 3rd Brigade on the terrain of the newly liberated Poland.

We need to take part in a chase after the Russian Army and liberate the Polish soil.

Victory conditions: Strike hard and follow the retreating Russians. Take all VHs. 1st unit must survive.

Intelligence report: Enemy units are weak and shattered but remnants of the destroyed units can attack from the woods.

This is a joint operation,so Habsburg's and Hohenzollern's equipment is available.   
A cavalry unit will speed up the chase. Our supply lines are long, so prestige will be given only if the outcome will not be brilliant.

Good Luck!
