Last chance militia of barely armed and untrained men too young or too old to fight...
Units were mostly composed of members of the Hitler Youth, invalids, the elderly, or men who had previously been considered unfit for military service, and later on girls and women. Volkssturm soldiers were barely trained and armed with old rifles, often WWI leftovers.

While often very courageous and determined, they weren't more than an annoyance for the allies. Do not mix up with the Volksgrenadiere, a regular army formation.
