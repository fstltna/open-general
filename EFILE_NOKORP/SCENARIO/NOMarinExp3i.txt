Summer has come and Iceland is almost ours. The last point of resistance is the main British port and naval base; Our forces besiege it, but the British are holding strong, and we need you to take them out from the inside, by landing your troops right inside the city.

According to our intelligence this should be easy, the British lack ships and aviation, they won't be able to repell you. Just beware of those small rocky islands in front of the harbor, intelligence says they have been fortified and might present a danger to your ships. Ah yes and of course, the approach is mined, but you would have expected that.


Instructions: Get all VHs. You don't command the land forces.
