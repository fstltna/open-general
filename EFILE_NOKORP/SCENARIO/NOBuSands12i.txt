You already captured Mersa Matruh. Now, almost two years later, we're back at the same point, you'll have to do it again...
Beware, the new British Army Corps I've mentioned some months ago is fully operational, and I'm afraid the opposition you will face will be much stronger than last time.

I don't have only bad news though: High Command sends you a new unit to test. We have those 7.62 cm PaK 36(r) we've taken from the Russians and bolted on a SdKfz 6 for more mobility. High command has shipped one for you to put though its paces down here in the open. Rumor has it they are quite efficient against armor and they have a good range too.



Instructions: Capture all VHs.
