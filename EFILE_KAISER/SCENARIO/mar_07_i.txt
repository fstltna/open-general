1924 Retreat from Xauen

November, 15th, 1924

Conversation at General Primo de Rivera's HQ:

Good morning, General. Sit down. There is something important that I want to tell you.

When His Majesty the King Alfonso XIII authorized the suspension of the parliamentary system and my dictatorship, I decided thar my priority would be the end of the war of Morocco, but that is not going to be an easy task. After Annual the "kabilas" see Abd el-Krim as their saviour and liberator, and the number of insurgents grows day by day.

Our garrisons, poorly equipped and scattered all over the Protectorate, are in extreme danger, since a general Berber attack would make them fall one by one, causing a massacre. The danger is specially critical in the western part of the Protectorate.

For that reason I decided to retreat all of the Spanish garrisons on the western zone to strong defensive lines near the main towns: Ceuta, Larache and Tetuán.  Now the retreat is almost finished, but we still have to take the last step of the operation, and the most dangerous one: the retreat from Xauen to Tetuán. I count on you for this task. Don't fail us, General!


Victory conditions: You must retreat a total of 25 Spanish units.
Beware: If the enemy takes Dar Accoba on the 7 first turns, you will lose.
