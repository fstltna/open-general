    SS Frau Gen. Kartha,have they Broke?
  The question from the Fuhress back in the Frauland.So many Forces destroyed around Leningrad.So many attacks repelled and so many supplies spent the Reich Logistics minister had informed Ilse that action would have to be curtailed on the other Fronts if Leningrads defense had to be kept supplied at the rate it was.Of course the Fuhress blew a gasket and chased the Logistics head out of the building with Her Luger.Once calmed down of course the numbers could not lie,The 'Ivans had to break or Leningrad would have to be vacated.'How in the World can they,can We keep this up?It will make Us all Mad sustaining this'?The Fuhress looked over Her Map.Is this how the War with Stalin was going to be,and Lenningrad had a decent supply route through the Baltic States.The other Fronts did not.A War Cabinet meeting was called.Production quotas would be increased,more Slave Labor had to be drawn into the process,more transports had to be allocated to Supply.Eradication would have to be curtailled and the males in the 'Frauland would have to push the 'Slaves a little harder plus more Factories would have to be built.Could the SS/BdM beat the Numbers Stalin had?
