Battle of East Friesland
We could trap several armies in East Friesland. We have reliable information that the west allied plans to evacuate the troops through the harbors of Emden and Wilhelmshaven. Take Emden and Wilhelmshaven before the ships arrive and destroy most of the enemy's troops to prevent the possibilities of a counterattack.
Your troops: 
Besides your tank army a little army will support you. This troops could be useful for the conquer of Emden.
Enemy troops:
The trapped opponents still have several dangerous tank divisions and plenty infantry. The air force will made problems to you, especially because you will have no airfield at the beginning of the battle. The next airfield is too far away. Be sure that you have troops that can build an airport.
