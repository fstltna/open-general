Retreat to Tannenberg Line - Waffen Equiptment

For almost half a year, an exhausted and severely outnumbered Army Group Narva has managed to withstand the mighty Red Army on the West banks of the Narva River. In their desperate struggle to hold the line, the German forces are supported by a huge amount of foreign volunteers. 
Numerous attacks have been halted, but when the Russians break through and threaten to encircle the fortress city of Narva, the German High Command finally orders the retreat. The next stand will be made at the Tannenberg Line. . . .

The Russians want to break the German defense in an all out attack. Their objective is to seize Narva, break through the Tannenberg Line, and occupy all enemy ports, airfields, and key cities. Naturally, the loss of any vital industrial zones, airfields, or port facilities will not be tolerated. 
The German objective is to hold the Tannenberg Line and the Southern stretch of the Panther Line. In addition, nearby enemy ports, airfields, and industrial zones need to be seized and destroyed in order to delay the deployment of Russian reinforcements.
