AT THE GATES

Ryburn's Diary - January 4th, 2054

"Phoenix gave me the honor today of leading the assault on the capital.  We're pushing the Arm back on all fronts; we just might win this thing!"

"It's time to take the fight to the men in charge.  I trust the men and they trust me.  We'll get the job done."
