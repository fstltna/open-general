Sino-French War - Lang Son - February 9th, 1885


Ma chère Fabienne,

Our campaign in Tonkin is being successful, even though the Chinese resistance is harder than we had expected. My column will provide the reinforcements that our army needs.

In the first weeks of the war our men engaged the Qing army in several battles on the Luc Nam valley, expelling them from Kep, Núi Bop and other important positions. Now that I've joined them, it's time to advance into northern Tonkin, until we reach the Chinese border and force them to surrender. Our next goal is the capture of Lang Son. Should the town fall, nothing will stand between our army and the Zhennan mountain pass, the Gate of China.

This tiny war will be over soon, and I'll be back home before your bithday. I miss you,

Jean-Babtiste.


ORDERS: Take all 5 victory hexes that the enemy currently controls. 

REMARKS: Be careful with possible Qing counterattacks.
