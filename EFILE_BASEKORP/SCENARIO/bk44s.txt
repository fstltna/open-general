Herr General, we have made a grave error. The situation on Crete has become hopeless. It was a mistake to send your troops there. You must evacuate the island. To do this, you must hold the port on the island and the mainland. The port city is the only position on the island that you must keep control of. You must ferry your troops to the mainland and repair and occupy the Italian positions. The Italians will hold as long as possible.

** You can recapture the Italian hexes - they are currently owned by the Allied forces **

++ You must retreat 5 units to the escape hex with the Italian flag ++
