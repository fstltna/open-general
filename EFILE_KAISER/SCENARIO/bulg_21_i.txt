First battle of Kobadin

September 17th, 1916

Before reaching the port of Konstantia we must break the last line of defence that Romania and Russia have built, which goes from Rasova to Tuzla. The High Command has decided that you, along with some German and Ottoman troops, will lead the attack on the Western sector, from Rasova to Kobadin. 
This battle will be a difficult one. There are some six enemy divisions in the area, although some of them may be weakened after the previous battles, and the've had time to build trenches and machine gun nests. You'll have to employ your resources carefully, using your artillery to open holes on the enemy defence system before advancing.

Intelligence report: The enemy air force is significantly stronger than in previous battles, so be careful.

Victory conditions: Take all VHs.
