<Out of the frying pan and into the fire!>

<Look at your future, ape!  Look at it burn around you!  The result of your petty rivalries accentuated by atomic power.>

<The survivors of this region are angry.  Understandably, since it was people like you who pulled the final trigger.   Don't have too many qualms about killing them, though; the cult they belong to practices a style of misogyny and spartan living that even someone like YOU would find deplorable.>

<Anyway, regardless of whether you want to or not, the cultists are on our doorstep and ready to destroy the transporter, so if you ever want to see your home again I suggest getting out there and shooting apes.>

<I've repaired the nano-capacitors and micro-processors, so I can fabricate any piece of equpment you need now, and repair or resupply your equipment as needed.  Just be careful on the sand.  The technology never quite works properly when there are a lot of sand particles milling about.>

<Survival is the mission.  Now go.>
