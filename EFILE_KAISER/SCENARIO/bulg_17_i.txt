Second battle of the Crna Bend

May 5th, 1917

For more than a year our duty in the Macedonian front has consisted in repelling fierce offensives from the Entente armies. The Bulgarian divisions have fought bravely, but we have been unable to counterattack. Our enemies are too strong for that, at least for the moment.
Just like the British did at Doiran Lake some days ago, now the French are preparing a new assault against our positions on the Crna bend. Our scouts have reported enemy movements on the mountains between the river banks, east and south of our lines of trenches, so we think that the main attacks will come from there.
Once again, the Entente will use a multinational army against us. This time the attack will be made by at least three French divisions, a Russian brigade and one Italian division. You will have to reinforce our Bulgarian and German garrisons and repel the enemy at all costs.


Victory conditions: Take all VHs.
