06. Hube's Pocket - The German Collapse 28 February 1944

After the relief attempt of Group Stemmerman, the whole First Panzer Armee is now threatened with encirclement. sPzRgt Bäke is disbanded and your 503 sPzAbt is attached to the weakened 7th Panzer Division that is positioned on the Northern flank of First Panzer Armee.

The Soviet Fifth Guards Army is threatening our positions at Staro Konstantinov. Infantry and artillery from the 96th Infantry Division backed up by sPzAbt 509 of Capt.Heinrich Radtke with its 28 Tigers will check their advance until we can bring up 6th Panzer Division for a counter attack. The Soviet Sixtieth Army is believed to be moving South, West of Staro Konstantinov.

Next to 6th and 7th Panzer Division, also the Kampfgruppe of 1SS LSSAH - that has been diverted from Ternopol by train - is available to stop the Soviet advance. Each of the units in the Kampfgruppe have been allocated a few of the remaining Leibstandarte's tanks. 

No further reinforcements are expected.

The Soviets are expected to have their infantry army assaults followed up by tank army attacks. Stop the enemy from gaining terrain and encircling First Panzer Armee.
