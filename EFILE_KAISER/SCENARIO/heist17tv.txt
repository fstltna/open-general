Kindralleitnant,
   
With severe losses, your troops have entered Luga.  The stiffened resitance on the part of the Red Army does not bode well for the offensive:  it appears a change of leadership and policy (Lev Trotsky assumed command of the Red Army, re-instated officer ranks, and enforced conscription) has improved the Red Army's fighting abilities and organization.

With Luga in our hands, the I Corps has approached Gatchina to the north, and the prize of Petrograd is just beyond!
