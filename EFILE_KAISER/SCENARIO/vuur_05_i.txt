Driefontein

March 10th, 1900

Cronjé's surrender has left us in a desperate position. We have lost thousands of men and lots of equipment, and the effect on the morale of our commandoes has been devastating. Roberts is advancing across the Orange Free State and nobody seems to be capable of stopping him. Some days ago Christiaan de Wet tried to offer some resistance, but most of his men fled the battlefield. Your arrival was an unexpected relief for him.

Now that you have joined de Wet's remaining forces we could have a chance to slow, or even reject the Kakies before they take Bloemfontein. It may be difficult, but we must try as long as we have the strength.

Victory conditions:
-After 14 turns you must hold 4 VHs for a BV, 2 VHs for a V and 1 VH for a TacV.
- Your MSU core unit must survive.

Special notes:
- The British cavalry is heading to Baberspan and outnumbers you, so use the terrain wisely.
- De Wet's troops are known for their sneak attacks behind the enemy lines.
