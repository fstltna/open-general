Situation:

German fighters are invading into our airspace over the Netherlands and Belgium. Our airfields and grounded planes in this area seem to be their targets. 

Orders:

Save the airfields at any costs! Defend all 5 MSU for a brilliant Victory. If one MSU gets killed you will loose the scenario.

Please note:

A new core Flak is given to your army. Although the Germans do not have many bombers, the Flak could still be useful to weaken up infantry units and other soft targets in the future.

Please note that because of the missing of a useful map of the whole Netherlands, all airfields from the Netherlands the Germans attacked were placed on this map.
