Your Highness, I regret to inform you that the disembark at Toulon has failed. Most of our elite troops have died or have been taken, including their leader. Undr these circumstances, I believe that we should cease all our current military operations. The outcome of the war will depend entirely on wether the Germans can defeat the French in the Marne and in Flandern.
