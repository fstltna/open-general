Taiwan Strait - Nuclear Crisis

1-9-1953, Sea of China.

I hope you had enough rest from your participation on the Korean War.  As one of the heroes of the PRC the High Command of the PLA has a new mission for you.  The new North American government has retired the fleet that was guarding the Taiwan Strait.  This is the opportunity we have been waiting for; the assault on the rebel province of Taiwan.  You must end the existence of the KMT and its leader, Chiang-Kai-Shek.

Embark your units in Tianjing and reach the Taiwanese coast as soon as possible.  Beijing is sure the UN will take part in operations like in Korea, this time supporting the KMT in Taiwan.  Your highest priority is the conquest of Taipei.  With this city we will complete the unification of all the Chinese territories.
