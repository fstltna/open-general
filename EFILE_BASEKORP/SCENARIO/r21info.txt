21. SEVASTOPOL 1944 (7 May 1944)

A month ago we broke through fascist lines at the Perekop peninsula, the sole connection of the Crimean peninsula with the Ukrainian mainland. The enemy has retreated from all over the Crimea to Sevastopol which has been turned into a fortress once again. And this time we will be attacker - and we will gain victory!

Our forces might run of fuel and ammo before they reach Sevastopol, because of the distances traveled. Also non-motorized units are still on their way to the front. So expect them to arrive anytime. Moskva accepts no delay in taking the city, so you have orders to attack immediately. We are unsure if the enemy is trying to hold the city or to evactuate their forces. Because of the last option, you must attack quick and kill as many fascists as possible so the Crimea is once again free and liberated! Good luck, comrade.
