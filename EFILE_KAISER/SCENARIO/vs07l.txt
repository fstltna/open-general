La Bataille de L'Ourcq - Monthyon - September 1914 BV

Your actions lead to a complete failure of our plans. Von Kluck had to more and more divisions of the First Armee back to the NW to repulse the attack of the French Sixth Army.
With that move, Von Kluck has left the flank of the Second Armee wide open, creating a gap in the German front between the First and Second Armee. The BEF and French Fifth Armee are slowly moving more and more troops N - in that gap. 

Only by withdrawing the First and Second Armee behind the Aisne, the German cavalry could close the gap and restore the frontline. The von Schlieffen plan had failed. The only option left to achieve a quick victory on the  Western Front was to outflank the enemy armies. Both sides tried to do this multiple times, leading to a 'Race to the Sea'.
