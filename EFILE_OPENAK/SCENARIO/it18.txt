EGYPT OR MALTA August01 1942

Planes and ships stationed at Malta are again causing heavy shipping losses on our transport route from Italy to North Africa. At the same time, we have broken through 8th Army's defences at Mersa Matruh and only some weak British units stand in the between us and the Suez Canal. 

It is your choice to either take this unique chance to reach the Suez now or improve your supply situation and make a better prepared dash to the Suez later this month.

Note: Move the tank unit into Egypt on turn one, or move an infantry unit to Malta (South of Italy) in two or more turns.
