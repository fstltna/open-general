General, we are now close to the successful completion of Operation ICHI-GO.  To achieve our goals we must take the land route from Korea to Indochina and to eliminate the U.S. Air Force controlled airfields.  Liuchow must fall!  Take the city and the nearby airfield before it can be evacuated.  We expect some guerrilla activities to disrupt our advance!
