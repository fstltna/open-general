Come in General......its been quite a wet spring no?

General, The Germans spearheads once again race across the step....leaving large pockets of Soviet forces behind for us to reduce.  Barenkovo has two soviet armies inside will attempt to breakout east.  Your corps must prevent this.

You MUST establish the river as the screen line or the soviets are sure to infiltrate in great numbers.  The Soviets could start to move any moment, so you must move quickly!

STAFF INTEL: The Russians are already heading east and have bridged the river-balkas, but they are spread out, we must not allow them to mass.
