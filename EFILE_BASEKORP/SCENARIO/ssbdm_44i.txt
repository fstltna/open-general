    "Let's get to the Volga first"
  SS Frau Commander Genia Hahn Warlimont's response to the Frau's under Her command. There was finally light at the End of the Tunnel and Euphoria was starting to set in for the Common Frau who now thought there was a slim chance She would see the Frauland again.Genia knew the SS was going to win but also knew Stalin still had the Kalanin Front and Volga Front to fight through before Moscow would be under the Frau's Gun so a lot of Fraus were still going to perish in the struggle between Bolshevism and Nazism.Of course trying to calm the Girls down was virtually impossible.That relief soon if they lived through it would have nothing to compare to it.How can anything compare to War? How can anything compare to seeing those near You there one minute and the next to be torn asunder in a Blink of an eye?To see piles of Comrades dead or injured knowing it could have been You if not for the Grace of the Creator.Seeing the Dead,the smell of burning flesh,it would never leave Your mind how it reaked,You could taste it. And the Frau's were counting down,surely the War would be over before Christmas.Hopefully this Winter would be a little milder than the last when so many died from the elements and the Soviet Mass attacks while the Air Korps was grounded. Just a few more battles,let Me live through it the Common Frau prayed.
