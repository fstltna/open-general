HONGCH'ON (26 December 1950)

The communist cause is stronger than ever!  The combined might of the expeditionary Chinese Liberation Army and the rebuilt North Korean People's Army will destroy the imperialistic ambitions on the Korean peninsula!  Our Chinese comrades have pushed the enemy back to just below the 38th Parallel.  Unfortunately our advance is losing steam; even spirited citizens cannot endure this much longer!  The United Nations is regaining its strength but we still own the momentum and we will not give it away until we see the last capitalists leave our Korea!

Take a look at this map, Comrade General.   It clearly shows that the Chinese have manned a line from the western coast to the central mountains.  Our People's Army will operate in the mountains and along the eastern coast!  Your Corps is deployed near Kansong but now you have orders to attack the southern positions between the coast to the east and the Hwach'on Reservoir to the west.   We still do not have the firepower needed to continue frontal assaults on the enemy.  You are familiar with our doctrine: "Penetrate as deep as possible and then turn on the enemy flanks".   We will meet again at your ultimate goal: Honch'on!
