Gospodin General, the results of the offensive have thus far been stunning!  By June 10th, in addition to your capture of Lutsk, Czernowitz has fallen.  Over 4,000 Austrian officers and 200,000 soldiers have been captured.  After having refused to attack along his Western Front, General Ewarth transferred control of his southern-most 3rd Army to Brusilov's command.

Brusilov's meticulous preparation has proven successful:  the Austrians failed to rush reserves to locations of our breakthrough, and garrison after garrison was surrounded and neutralized.

Before the autumn rains set in, the South-Western Front must deploy for a second push toward Kowel.  Our Front is receiving additional resources from Stavka, and Brusilov is forming the Osobaya (Special) Army for this push.
