Gospodin General-Leitenant, Mackensen's spearhead - the GardeKorps - engaged our Leib-Guards in this battle.  
Having failed to capture the town of Krasnostav head-on, the GardeKorps lost an opportunity to force the XIV and III Kavkazky Corps to remain on the western bank of the Wieprz, resulting in a significantly blunted overall attack.

The year 1915 ended for the South-Western Front with a stabilization of the line deep within our territory: from the Pripet Marshes to Tarnopol, the enemy has dug his entrenchment scar deep into our lands.  The massive Germano-Austrian offensive during the second half of the year has shattered morale but failed to rout us.  Your participation in the action at Galicia during our retreat has played a major role in delaying the German advance:  from the Carpathian Mountains to Przemysl you stood between German staff expectations and reality. 

The Army has regrouped and re-equipped.  Our Prussian enemy has been cornered into a two-front war of attrition on a massive scale.  The year of 1916 will see a more co-ordinated effort by the Entente to bring this war to an end.
