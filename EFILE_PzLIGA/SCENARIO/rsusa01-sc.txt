San Francisco - Night Surprise

August, 1943

Did you really think we were sailing to Pearl Harbor?  Allow me to explain the true plans for your troops.  While the other troop formation that we were sailing with is going to Pearl Harbor, your command will simultaneously disembark on a night attack against the Monterey beaches, southwards from San Francisco.  This double attack will completely surprise the Americans as they are only awaiting an attack on Pearl Harbor or Alaska, but not an attack on the US mainland!  They have started building fortification works on the beaches, but they haven't enough troops to stop our night assault.  They only have a couple of recently formed divisions and the ''National Guard'' of California.

Your mission is to seize Monterey and the surrounding area to use as a port.  Tomorrow morning our reinforcements will arrive as we expecting a heavy counterattack from San Jose and other minor villages near San Francisco.  Be aware; San Francisco is not our objective today as we are not ready for its heavy fortifications.

See!  They haven't even switched off the lights of the cities, the surprise will be enormous, imagine the face of the US citizens when our troops land!  Hahaha!  Prepare for disembarkation, we are arriving...
