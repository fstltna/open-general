The Ice March

Feb 23rd, 1918

My God, how did I end like this?

Less than four years ago life had granted me everything that I had wished. I was a well-respected officer in the Imperial Army, with a nice family. I couldn't dream on anything else.

Then the war started. We could handle the Austrians and the Ottomans, but the German Army was too powerful. Defeats led to desperation. Many people lost their hope in a brighter future. And once hope left, madness was all that was left behind. Revolutionary madness that spread like an infectious disease. And the Bolsheviks were the worst of all. Many people believed their lies. Men that once had been honest and hard working became no better that rabid dogs. Chaos swallowed everything that I believed sacred.

Once I swore to defend the Tsar and my country. Now the Tsar is a prisoner and I can hardly recognize my country. Sometimes I wonder if I'm still obliged by my oath. Katya is safe in Sweden with the girls and Yuri. Maybe Anatoly and I should leave the fight and join them.

But I know I won't do it. My oath still binds me, and it will always do. When we learnt that generals Alekseyev and Kornilov had gathered some men ready to fight the Bolsheviks, Anatoly and I were among the first members of the Volunteer Army. Alas, the revolutionary madness is very powerful and we are too few. We could hardly arrive in Rostov, and now we know that the Red Army is coming. We must retreat further South, through the open field and the snow, far from the railway lines. If we manage to survive the Reds, the cold and the ice and get to the Kuban we could have a chance to perform a counterattack.

My God, how did I end like this?

Victory conditions:
- Evacuate 4 civilian units through the EH at (38,32).
- At least 4 out of 6 civilian units must survive.
