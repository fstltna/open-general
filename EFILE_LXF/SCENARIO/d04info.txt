04. BATTLE OF LEUWILIANG (2 March 1942)

STRATEGIC SITUATION:
Java, the main East Indies island, is being invaded! An Allied fleet was unable to stop the Japanese invasion fleet at the Battle of the Java Sea. The surrounding islands of Borneo, Sumatra and Timor are in Japanese hands so Java is encircled. Only the southern Java coast offers a retreat route to Australia. We have two Dutch KNIL divisions on the islands and an Australian detachment as well as some British and American forces. But we are greatly outnumbered by two Japanese reinforced elite divisions. The Japanese 2nd Division has landed west of Batavia, capitol of Java, and a detachment has landed east of the city. It is marching in three columbs to the east. Two detachements will march on Batavia directly while a third, known as Nasu Detachment is travelling just south of the others towards Bogor/Buitenzorg to cut off the route of retreat for the Batavia garrison. You must prevent this by all means.

TACTICAL ORDERS:
The Japanese Nasu Detachment has reached the village of Leuwiliang where the Australian Blackforce detachment is deployed. The Japanese are crossing the river and have made a small bridgehead to the south of the village. You must reinforce their lines and annihilate the Japanese bridgehead as well as prevent the Japanese from breaking through and taking Leuwiliang. Good luck.
