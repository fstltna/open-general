Operation Overlord will be the largest amphibious invasion ever seen by man, and you must stop it. You should strive to pin the Allies in Normandy by holding St. Lo, Caen, St. Mere Eglise, and Cherbourg until after July 5th when we hope reinforcements will arrive and throw the Allies back into the sea. At a minimum, hold at least one of these key towns.
