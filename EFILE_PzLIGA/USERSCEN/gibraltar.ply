July 26, 1941 - August 6, 1941 ; 24 turns

Hypothetical attack on the British garrison at Gibraltar by the Axis forces.

On both sides units of all classes fight for the famous "rock" at the entrance to the Mediterranean. The assault is impeded by difficult terrain, new fortifications and obstacles. Will the fortress fall?
