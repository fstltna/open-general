Your defeat at Irkutsk was a grave miscalculation that the West could ill-afford. The Chinese shifted the bulk of their armies to the north and launched a counterstrike on Novosibirsk that has effectively pocketed the Russian troops that were en route to join your army. With your forces already decimated, there is no way to prevent their slaughter. You have been allowed to surrender what remains of your command to the People’s Republic of China.
