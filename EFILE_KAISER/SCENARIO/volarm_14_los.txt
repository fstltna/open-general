Diterikhs had to come to my rescue. Moscow is in our hands, but not due to my merits. I have a personal sense of defeat.

Anywat, tomorrow there will be a great parade at the Red Square. Our army will march along the main streets of Moscow, that has finally awaken from this nightmare that has lasted two years. 
Some prominent bolsheviks have died during the battle, but most of them have managed to escape, or have simply disappeared. Most of the communist survivors that we have located have fled to Petrograd, their last bastion. Once we take it, the revolution will be finally defeated and the war will be won. We'll recover our country.

To make this day better, Katya has told me that Anatoly and Olga are expecting their first baby. Our first grandchild will be born in a free Russia.
