Coronel,
 
Pérez Dasmariñas is the next stronghold of the insurgents in our way to Imus. According to reliable informers, they have gathered around 5,000 troops under the command of Aguinaldo himself. These are Aguinaldo's elite forces and have well-prepared defences.
 
General Lachambre idea is to take the village with a frontal assault combined with two flank manoeuvres. On the left, some troops under the command of Lachambre's son will clean the Gatludá hills on the other side of the San Agustín River and threaten rebels' positions in the main way. Teniente Coronel Villalón will protect the right flank and take the village of Paliparang. There he will join the column of Coronel Arizón to manoeuvre on the rear of the enemy, thus preventing Filipino rebels to escape. Unfortunately, it has been a while since we have not heard from Coronel Arizón and we are not sure when he will arrive. 

Your troops can choose to join the main effort in the centre or help in the flanks.
 
Victory conditions: To take all VH by turn 16 for a BV, turn 18 for a V and turn 20 for a TV.
