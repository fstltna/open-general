Casablanca

May 8th, 1943

This is the last battle to complete your campaign in Africa's West, the fortified City of Casablanca! The city is surrounded by mine fields and fortifications, at sea the Anglo-American Navy is imposing and the RAF have deployed all it's forces from the bases in Gibraltar. We trust you and we believe that you'll find a way to avoid all these obstacles in this struggle and kick-out the Allies from this sector of Africa.
