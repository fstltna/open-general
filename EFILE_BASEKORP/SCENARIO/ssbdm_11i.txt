  Winston Churchill's statement.The SS/KM's new Fuhress Class Battleships heading for open water.Their mission to patrol in the Atlantic to stop Convoys coming from Canada and those 'Ghost Convoys' coming from the U.S.A. that according to all information on the Allied side weren't.In Washington FDR sent out a memo for a few American Battleships to run exercises and a few Admirals to be very lient on rules of engagement should the SS/KM ships cross their path.So Frau GrandAdmiral Esebeck aboard the 'Frau Biss and Frau Admiral Hundsnerdorf on the 'Frau Tirptz were told by the Fuhress "In Your hands My Admirals are the finest fighting ships ever built to sail on the seas.They are far Superior, they are faster,better protected and their firepower is equal to anything by the Brits or as a matter of fact anyone else.Show the Enemies of the Fatherland their destructive power.Destroy the Dam Convoys and Britian will make Peace.If not then Britian will starve".So an engagement.The Royal Navy,France and Amerika against the SS/KM in the Atlantic.One that could bring Amerika into the War or a President down who had been saying to the People "No War in Europe".The Fuhress didn't care,the Convoys to support England had to be curtailed.
