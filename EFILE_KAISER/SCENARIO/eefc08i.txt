Second Gaza, 19th April 1917
---------------------------------------------
Our Command in Chief, General Murray, is quite optimistic about the prospects of our second attempt to take Gaza. The plan is for another frontal infantry assault on the Turkish positions at Gaza after two days of preliminary bombardment, while our cavalry will attack further east. Several new infantry divisions have arrived, and we have been sent a few tanks from the Western Front. French and British warships support us with all their firepower along the coast.

Well, that's the plan - and if I might speak frankly, Sir - I don't think much of it. The enemy has been alerted by our first attack on Gaza. The defences have apparently been strengthened since the first battle, and their forces around Gaza are growing day by day.

Let's hope for the best! Good luck, General!
