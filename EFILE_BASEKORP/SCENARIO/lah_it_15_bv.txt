I'm speechless.  Not only did you hold Caen against Montgomery's attacks, but you practically destroyed his army!   We have thrown the British back into the sea, and the Leibstandarte has once again proved itself worthy of the 'elite' status given to it.  We can not expand on the success though.  The Americans have broken out of the bocage terrain and we must pull back before we are encircled.
