You've done it! The French government has chosen to surrender before a second Marxist revolution arises in Europe. I'm not sure if France will be abe to stop the mutinies in time. If they had given up some months ago things would be different for them, but now it's probably too late. Besides, they can't expect any help or mercy from us. We'll make them pay for all these years of suffering.

The war in Europe is won, but we still have the problem with Britain. Invading England is impossible, but the OHL thinks that there is an alternative solution. Prepare your troops, General, this time the journey will be really long.
