Good Morning General

As you know, we have pursued the Germans back to the Adriatic coast, to their last major defensive line seperating us from the Po valley and the Lombardy plain in Northern Italy. Since many factories producing supplies vital to the German effort are located in the North, we expect the Germans to fight hard tp prevent our breakthrough. Your mission is to breach the "Gothic" line and drive North, capturing all key cities along the way to the main objective of Rimini. Victory in the coming battles means the beginning of the end for the German armies in Italy...Good luck General...
