Come in General!  Good Job you and your boys did!

Your troops met the Russians as they came racing through the gaps in 8th Army's front and your men and stubbornly forced them back to their start lines!

Thankfully we have re-established our defenses on the Don, but 4th Panzer Army could not break through and Hitler refused 6th Army to withdrawl!  4th Panzer Army is withdrawling back across the Chir and Manstein has called a General Cousel to discuss Strategy.
He will then fly to Berlin to directly persuade Hilter the reality of the situation.
You must come to this meeting, and pray, pray that we come up with a plan that Hitler will accept!
