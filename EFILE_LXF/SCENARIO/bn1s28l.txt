General Kurt Student

A disaster, General! Our air landing corps was destroyed. Thousands of soldiers are now prisoners of war. Obviously the air landing thought has itself meanwhile worn out. We will have to try immediately to step in peace negotiations.

Thanks for playing the GREEN DEVILS! I hope you enjoyed the campaign and maybe we will see each other again here, or in another of my campaigns.
