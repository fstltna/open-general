I. INTRODUCTION
__________________

    I've worked on and off on this campaign since 2003 . In 2009 the PG2 version was done and released. Now, in 2011 the version 1.0 for OpenGen is also ready.

 When i started, there were very few to none maps that could be used for a Romanian campaign, so i found myself in the position to learn how to make new maps, a process that i still consider the most complicated part of modding PG2/OpenGen. Since 2003 many things have changed for the better. More units in the equipment files for minor nations like Romania, higher quality campaigns in general but still Romania deserved a better representation through a campaign. I hope my campaign will meet expectation of players and raises to the quality of modern OpenGen campaigns.

 I suggest the prestige setting to be set at 100 %. The campaign is challenging but not difficult , except a few scenarios in order to reflect historical reality.
