Limanowa, December 8, 1914
Gospodin General-Major, after a period of rest, your troops are once again ready to fight on the Austro-Hungarian front.  Following the unsuccessful October-November offensives by the Germans (Lodz) and the Austrians (to relieve Przemysl), our South-Western Front resumed its offensive with the goal of capturing Krakau and launching an offensive into Silesia.

Our 3rd Army under Radko Dmitriev launched the offensive but was not able to break the front of the Austrian 4th Army (Archduke Josef Fredinand).  Stavka has resolved to pull the Carpathian Corps from Brusilov's 8th Army to achive a breakthrough at Limanowa.
