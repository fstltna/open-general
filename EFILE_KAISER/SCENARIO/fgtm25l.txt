Gospodin General-Leitenant, your feeble resistance against the Austrian offensive failed miserably, allowing the enemy to capture this key strategic position.  With the overall situation for our entire front in January assuming an aspect of precariousness, your failure may have devastating consequences for our entire Carpathian position.  General Brusilov has relieved you of your command and has ordered your replacement to recapture the lost positions immediately.
