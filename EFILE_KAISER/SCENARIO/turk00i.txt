Battle of Velestino - May 5th, 1897

In 1878 the Ottoman Empire promised to give Crete wide autonomy, but never fullfilled the agreement. Clashes between Muslims and Christians in Crete became increasingly frequent, and in 1897 the violence led to a Greek intervention on the island. On 7 February the Greek expeditionary force in Crete defeated an Ottoman force at the Battle of Livadeia.

One month later, Greek irregulars crossed the border into Ottoman Macedonia. The Ottomans, numerically superior, reacted quickly, defeating the invaders and occupying the Greek province of Thessalia. Larissa fell on 27 April, while the Greek front was reorganized behind the strategic lines of Velestino, in Farsala. On 5 May a Turkish division under Hakki Pasha attacked the 9,000 Greeks under Colonel Smolenski, who were holding a strong position there.
