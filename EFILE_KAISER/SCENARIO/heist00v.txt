Kapten,

You have performed superbly in this exercise.  Estonian authorities are impressed with the results and have placed your regiment as an example to other units forming in Estonia.  You have achieved a promotion to the rank of Major.

As the Great War continues to rage on the Eastern Front, Russia has begun assembling indigenous regiments of her non-Russian subjects.  Estonian politicians have poured all effort into keeping Estonian units on Estonian soil.
