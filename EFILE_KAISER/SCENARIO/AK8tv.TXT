Kemmelberg- April, 1918 - TV

Our enemies are simply too powerful. There are too many of them. It was foolish to believe that we could fight against five military powers at the same time. It was madness. We did everything we could, we did our best, and we really were so close... we touched victory with our fingertips. But, at the last second, victory ran away from us. We have thrown everything we had against the Entente lines, and they resisted. Now we have nothing left.

It’s time to prepare for the worse. The offensive must be cancelled. Still, we must fight to the end and prevent an invasion of Germany.
