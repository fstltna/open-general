SITUATION:

Herr General, our drive on Moscow has been quite successful, but enemy resistance continues to stiffen. You must break through along the highway in the Viazma area. There is no doubt; the enemy will commit his toughest units to defend the capital, but we will persevere.

ORDERS: 

Take all VHs in 12/15/19 turns for a BV/V/TV.
