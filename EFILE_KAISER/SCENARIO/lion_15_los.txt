In the end, God denied us the victory. It was the Germans who occupied coastal Eritrea and the Italian Somalia in September. However, they counted us among their friends, and they soon ceded those territories to us.

The old dream of Emperor Yohannes IV, my father and so many other Ethiopians finally became true. Ethiopia had its well-deserved access to the sea. Massawa and Assab were ours.

It was a bittersweet ending. We were on the winner's side, but I'm still sorry about my defeat at Massawa. I wish I had been able to win that battle. It's a thorn that will rip my flesh until the day I die.
