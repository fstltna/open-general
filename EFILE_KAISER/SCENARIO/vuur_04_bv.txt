French's troops have been so badly beaten by our commandoes that they have been forced to leave Colesberg. Of course, they won't be able to reinforce Roberts, either.

This area will be secure for some time. But, sadly, I have bad news from Kimberley. Roberts has forced Cronjé to leave his positions at Magersfontein, and now he's at risk of being trapped at the Modder River. Are you willing to go back to Kimberley? Cronjé has been unfair to you in the past, but the future of our country could be at stake.
