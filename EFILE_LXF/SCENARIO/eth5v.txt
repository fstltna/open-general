VICTORY

Ras Mulugueta's men were demoralized by weeks of inactivity, cooped up in caves and ravines.  They were constantly bombed, gassed and shelled, barely daring to move in the hours of daylight.

It had been the biggest colonial battle ever fought. It was not the sort of battle for which the Ethiopians had been prepared.

It is said that the Italians found 8,000 bodies on Amba Aradam. They burnt the bodies and for months afterwards the plains around smelt of charred flesh.

The Mahel Safari were bombed, strafed and raided 546 times according to Badoglio's account.
