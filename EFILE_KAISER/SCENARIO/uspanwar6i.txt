Manila Bay
(1 May 1898)
v.1.0
The sunset of the Spanish Empire - The Spanish American War 1898

General,

The American Asiatic Squadron under Commodore George Dewey has entered the waters of Manila Bay to attack and destroy our forces in the Pacific. The batteries and mines in the entrance of Manila Bay have proved ineffective.  

After the failed attempt to fortify Subic Bay, where our new naval base is being built, Rear Admiral Patricio Montojo has ordered his squadron back to Manila. He has placed it opposite to the Cavite Arsenal, in order to spare Manila from bombardment. So the decisive battle will be fought in Manila Bay's waters.

Victory conditions: To destroy 4 enemy vessels and keep at least 2 ships intact.

Tip: if you have been patient enough to keep or even smart enough to upgrade your core vessel this is the right moment to deploy it.
