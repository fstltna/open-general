KEREN
March 15th, 1941

With victory at Agordat, all that lies in the way of victory in Eritrea is the town of Keren.  To approach the town of Keren, which lies 4,300 feet above sea level, from any direction but the east means an arduous passage through mountainous country. A formidable barrier of hills guards the town as you drive towards it up the road from Agordat. Only one gap exists through this barrier, the narrow and climbing Dongolaas Gorge that takes both road and railway up to the Keren plateau.

The strategic possibilities of this natural position before Keren, has been for many years appreciated by the Italians as a defence of Asmara and the highlands of Eritrea. On the Keren escarpment General Luigi Frusci, the sixty-two-year-old commander in the field, who had served in the Spanish Civil War, has decided to make his main stand, and to concentrate the bulk of his forces here.

Previous attacks have already been made on this formidable mountain barrier and all have been thrown back by stubborn and persistent Italian counter-attacks.  The enemy is determined to hold on to these positions and is willing to fight to the death for them.  Your unit has been given the arduous task of capturing Fort Dologorodoc.  The 4th Indian Division and the 29th Brigade will advance on your flanks.
