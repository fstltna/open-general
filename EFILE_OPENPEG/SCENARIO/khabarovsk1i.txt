Khabarovsk, Siberia, Russia
The last Chinese toehold in the Russian Far East is at Khabarovsk. Hoping to gain some political advantage, the People's Republic is gathering all available reserves to hold this last section of foreign land. It is imperative that you break this stronghold showing the world that the Dragon has been slain. You must capture the city of Khabarovsk and drive south of the Ussuri River into China.
