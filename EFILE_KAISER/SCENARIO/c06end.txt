Well, if you like to see it that way.  The Poles were brave for defending that village to the bitter end but it turned into a Polish Thermopylae.  It only shows the superiority of the people's army!  The capitalists from London, Paris and Warsaw are sending their slaves to a certain death in order to stop us.  Yet they fail in stopping us!  They only slowed us down for a single day.  What is a single day in a war?  Go comrade, Lwow is ours!
