You have been too slow! Now when winter comes to our defensive positions, it will be very weak and we won't be able to resist the Soviet counterattack. We'll be forced to peace negotiations and surely we'll have to cede much of the territory we had taken from the Soviets.
I'll see to it that you assume full responsibility and be expelled from the Army.
