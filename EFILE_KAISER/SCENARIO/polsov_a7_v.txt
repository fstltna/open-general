A large part of the 2nd Brigade reached the Ukrainian positions. Some were captured and judged by KuK court martial but eventually paroled by the Kaiser Karl. Those who reached the Ukrianian lines fought for the Polish cause all around the world. 
Most fought against the Germans.
Then some returned home. 
Some, in ranks of the Polish 6th Infantry Division, guarded the retreat of the Czechoslovakian Legion in Siberia.
Some fought north of the Arctic Circle against the Bolsheviks.
Some fought on French soil, in the ranks of the Polish Army, commanded by General Józef Haller, against the Germans.
Eventually all who survived came back to Poland.
