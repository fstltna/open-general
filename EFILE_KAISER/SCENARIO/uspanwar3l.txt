Teniente Coronel, you must be ashamed of yourself!

Due to your incompetence, you have failed to take the village of Silang. This disaster has raised morale among the rebels and no the reconquer of Cavite province will take us longer and with heavier losses. 

With immediate effect you are dismissed from the army.

Historical background:

Silang was the first victory of the Spanish campaign of 1897 to recapture the territories of Cavite province which had fallen into Filipino hands in the early phase of the revolution in 1896. It was an important stronghold in the way to Imus, the seat of Aguinaldo's revolutionary government and the first main objective of the Spanish offensive.

Unlike Cuban mambises, Filipino rebels preferred open warfare to hit-and-run guerrilla warfare. They normally fortified themselves in villages and formidable trenches, forcing Spanish troops to storm the rebels' positions, with both sides suffering heavy casualties.

Despite tenacious Filipino resistance, Lachambre's troops recaptured Silang without major difficulties, forcing the rebels to retreat to Perez Dasmariñas in disorganized manner.
