Herr General: After our conquest of Smolensk the Soviet troops have been attacking our line centered on the city of Yelnia. Our troops cannot hold them off for long. If Yelnia is lost Smolensk will follow. You should use your Panzer corps to restore our front. 

Victory Conditions:

Hold 8 VHs to get a BV, 7 to a V, and 6 to a V. If you the Soviets take Yelnia you lose the scenario.
