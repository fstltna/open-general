On 28 September 1918 von Lettow again crossed the Rovuma and returned to German East Africa with the British still in pursuit. He then turned west and raided Northern Rhodesia, thus evading a trap the British had prepared for him in German East Africa. 
On 13 November 1918, two days after the armistice in Europe, Lettow-Vorbeck now appointed as Major General, got a letter from a captured British motorcyclist
who carried the message of armistice in Europe. He was suspicious of the message because it couldn´t be confirmed by the German High Command as they lost their last radio set 1917. On 13 November 1918, two days after the armistice, he took the town of Kasama which the British had evacuated, and continued heading south-west towards Katanga. When he reached the Chambeshi River  on the morning of 14 November, the British magistrate Hector Croad appeared under a white flag and delivered a message from the allied General van Deventer informing him of the armistice. 
Lettow-Vorbeck agreed to a cease-fire at the spot now marked by the Von Lettow-Vorbeck Memorial in present-day Zambia. He was instructed by the British to march north to Abercorn (now Mbala) to surrender his undefeated army, which he did there on 23 November.  In 1915 the Survivors of the light Cruiser Königsberg, the Artillery of the Königsberg and the Crew of the auxiliary ship Somali joined his army. His remaining army then consisted of 30 German officers, 125 German non-commissioned officers and other enlisted ranks, 1,168 Askaris and some 3,500 porters.
