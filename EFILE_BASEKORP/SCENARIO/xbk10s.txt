
Algiers - 

Algiers is a tough task but the General Staff is optimistic that you will be the right commander for this job. Your troops are backed by our Kriegsmarine and specially equipped  marine Kommando units. 
At first you will have to clear a strong mines and obstacle field before your troops can penetrate the fortress. The success of this operation will depend on the smooth cooperation between our navy and your ground troops! The Spanish military have supplied some naval units also.

GOAL: Take all VH's!
