The insurgency at Marash - victory

After three weeks of fighting, the remnants of the French "division de Cilicie" had been forced to retreat. 

Historical outcome
Although the Turkish couldn't overcome the French defences, and the battle stilll didn't have a clear winner, on February 11 general Quérette and his troops retreated from Marash. Most of the Armenian civilians in the town were then massacred by the Muslim militias, or froze to death during the evacuation.

Marash and other similar engagements were a proof that the Turkish revolutionaries weren't going to fulfill any agreement that questioned the complete Turkish sovereignty over Anatolia, and that the Ottoman administration didn't have any control over the rebels. And they also proved that France, Italy and the British Empire weren't willing to lose more soldiers and resources in a new war in Turkey. They had already obtained what they wanted so, if pressed hard enough, they would eventually retire from Anatolia. They wouldn't fight and die defending the Greek or the Armenian interests.

So, although the Treaty of Sèvres, signed on 10 August 1920, established that Turkey had to cede parts of Anatolia to Greece and Armenia, and that there would be British, Italian and French zones of influence over most of the country, the Ottoman Government simply couldn't ratify it. The revolution was at its peak and, depending on the outcome of the clashes against the Greek Army, the Western Powers knew that they would have to negotiate again.
