Last stand at the Oder - August 1945

Our industry is crumbling, we are desperately short on oil, our transport network is falling apart and our cities are in ruins. The war is lost. After you beat their previous attempt in April, the Western Allies have now crossed the Rhein and are on route to Berlin. 

The Soviets are ready for their own attack on Berlin. They have brought in their Far Eastern Army, much of their forces from the Balkans and forces from East Prussia and Silesia for one HUGE three-pronged strike towards Berlin. Your forces are located on the West bank of the Oder at Seelower Höhen and will face the brunt of the Soviet forces. Do not expect reinforcements. They are required to hold the front North and South of Berlin. 

Your orders are to stop the Red Army so that our civilians can flee to the West and Berlin will end up in American hands, not in the hands of the Soviet barbarians.
