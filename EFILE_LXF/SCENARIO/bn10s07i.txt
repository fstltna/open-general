
GIBRALTAR - 24 FEB 1941

Gibraltar, Spain

Gibraltar is a tough task, since 1704 the Brits had time to dig in here and ironically, it was a German general who has conquered this rock for the British. But the General Staff is optimistic that you will be the right commander for this job. Your troops are backed by our Luftwaffe and specially equipped pioneer and artillery battalions. At first you will have to clear a strong mines and obstacle field before your troops can penetrate the fortress. The success of this operation will depend on the smooth cooperation between our Luftwaffe and your ground troops! The Spanish military let us use their airfields, but will not participate in this operation.

GOAL: Take all VH's!
