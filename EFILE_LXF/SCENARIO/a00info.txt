00. LINZ 1 (12 March 1938)

Herr General, this day is a bad day in Austrian history. Today our country is under attack by our old brother-in-arms from the Great War, Germany, which is ruled by the Nazis. We will not become another victim of the Nazis. We will resist!

Our Army will mobilize at once and soon we will have 8 divisions, including one Fast division and one Brigade. Your regiment is part of the 4th Division at Linz. We will hold the German advance through to the Danube Valley to Vienna first at the Traun River and second at the Enns River. Your division will slow down the initial German advance while 1st, 2nd and 5th Divisions will man the Traun Line.

The Germans have crossed the border with at least 8 divisions with possibly more in reserve. In your sector at least two divisions. of which one is a Panzer division, have crossed the border. Your regiment, 14th "Hessen", along with other formations of 4th Division must hold the Germans off Linz and the Traun River. It is of the utmost importance that the Germans are slowed down for at least four days which should be enough for other divisions to deploy at the Traun. You are expected to give all you have - even your own life. Austria must be saved!
