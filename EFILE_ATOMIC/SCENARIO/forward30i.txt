Battle at the Ruhr
The majority of the war production for the west allied comes from the Ruhr area. If we will be able to capture the Ruhr area it will be more difficult for the allied to get supplies. Take the Ruhr area, Düsseldorf and build a bridgehead over the Rhine.
Your troops:
Besides your tank army several divisions will support your troops. Relating to your request we have given you more Flak units for this battle.
Enemy troops:
The enemies are not numerous. In the east of the Ruhr area the west allied have built a front which is saved by blockings, landmines and barbwire. More in the south the resistance seems to be not so hard.
