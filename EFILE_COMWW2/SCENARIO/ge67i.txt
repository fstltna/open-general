Ah, Herr General, excuse me, Herr Feldmarschall! As you know, our campaign in the north continues to go well.  You have been chosen to lead our invasion in the south.  After your beachhead is secure,  it is imperative for you to seize the port city of Savannah. Once this is accomplished, our drive inland will cut the United States in half.  It is believed that the Americans are ignorant of our plans.  But be aware that the people of this region will fight us to their last breath.
