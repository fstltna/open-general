
DUNKIRK - 30 MAY 1940

The climax of the retreat through Belgium and northern France has commenced! The BEF and elements of various French armies have gathered in a small area around Dunkirk. The British have started their evacuation and have promised to take on French soldiers as well. This is yet to be seen. However, this is not the time for such talk.

For the evacuation to progress steadily, it is vital that the Germans are kept away from the beaches. The British will defend most of the Dunkirk perimeter but your French forces will defend the most western sector at Gravelines. You must hold out as long as possible, and slowly falling back on Dunkirk if needed.

GOAL: Hold 5/4/3 VH's for a BV/V/TV!
