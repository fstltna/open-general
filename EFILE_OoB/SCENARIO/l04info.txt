04. BERISLAV (30 August 1941)

To the commanding officer of 22. ID (LL):

Your unit has reached the mighty Dnjepr river at Berislav. Three days of preparation will now culminate into a daring, dangerous crossing of the river with three regiments at once at a broad front. The enemy is prepared and is known to have reserves. You must succeed and clear the way for other divisions to cross the river. Your division is assigned with a key mission.


RULES: 
- Do not upgrade, sell or buy units - nor upgrading transports.
- Replacing lost units by buying new units is allowed. Replacements should be the exact same unit as the lost unit.
