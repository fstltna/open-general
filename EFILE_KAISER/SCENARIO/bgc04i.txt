3rd Battle of Krithia - 04/06/1915
-----------------------------------------------------
General, during the last weeks the British contingent on the Helles front has been expanded to three division and a brigade. However, the situation at Helles remains perilous. We are short of guns and ammunition. Furthermore, after HMS Triumph and HMS Majestic have been torpedoed by the enemy in May, the situation has even worsened as our naval gunfire support was reduced. Fortunately, our French ally has been able to lend us some of his fine 75s batteries that now have been deployed in our sector of the Helles front.

The objectives for the forthcoming battle are as follows: 
While the French advance against Haricot Redoubt on the right, and the 42nd Division and Royal Naval Divison - supported by some armoured cars of the RNAS - attack in the centre, 29th Division has again the difficult task to push the frontline up Gully Ravine. This area has recently been heavily fortified by the Turks, so expect a hard and bloody fight. Your troops will be joined by the 29th Indian Brigade.

Good luck, General! You will need it.
