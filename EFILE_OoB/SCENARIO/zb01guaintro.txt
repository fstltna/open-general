Be seated Oberleutnant.
 
The Italian Duce has completed the arrival, concentration and supply of his forces in Spain; word from Rome is that he is cocksure they will easily crush the enemy and bring this conflict to a quick end. 

Their orders are to smash through the enemy's weakly held line northeast of Madrid and capture Guadalajara; this will sever the capital from its remaining sources of supply and support. This assault will utilize tanks and motorized infantry, together with some air support provided by fighter-plane; the Spanish Soria Division will also advance, covering the Italian's right flank. 

We are assigning you as liaison - and as our eyes - to the Italian Corps for this operation. Should the Italians request support from the Legion, inform them that because of losses suffered at Jarama it will be difficult. 

[Designer note: My idea for this campaign is that the 'HQ Detail' unit represents "you" the player in the campaign; if it is destroyed then please consider that to be as if your game character has been killed and the scenario/campaign to be over/lost. (On the other hand, if you are able to score a leader for it you are immediately promoted to Generalfeldmarschal and automatically win the game - j/k.)]
