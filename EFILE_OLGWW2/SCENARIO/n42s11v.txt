General,

You have again dealt a blow to the Americans, but they still refuse to receive our envoy. We have however been able to influence the American press to write about our peace offer, and a debate has started in America.

Also while you were busy, a revolt has broken out in Warschau. Clearly the goal is to establish an independent state before the Soviets enter Warschau. We will see what the English think of it.

And the English are thinking a lot: The fact the we agreed that Romania may break our alliance, but that the Soviets refuse peace with Romania and insist on the occupation of Romania has brought Soviet-allied relations to the point of rupture. We have allready noticed a big decline in English bombers over Germany.
