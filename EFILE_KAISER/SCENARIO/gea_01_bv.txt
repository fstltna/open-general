Congratulations!  Your performance is even better than the historical result of the battle. 

After your success at Jasin the Germans will be able to intensify their attacks against the Uganda railway and to send more troops to the Bukoba radio station. These will be your next missions.

Historical aftermath: The British resistance was very strong and although they finally surrendered, they inflicted heavy casualties on the Germans. Aware that he could not replace his losses Lettow-Vorbeck decided to avoid any more large scale battles and start guerrilla warfare. His first attack was against the Uganda Railway.
