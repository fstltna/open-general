Alsen was the last major battle of the war. Between June and July the Germans occupied all of Jutland (continental Denmark), and the Danes had to surrender. On 1 August 1864 the King of Denmark renounced all his rights in the duchies in favour of the Emperor of Austria and the King of Prussia. The peace treaty was finally signed in Vienna on 30 October 1864.

The alliance between Prussia and Austria didn't last long. Bismarck, the Prussian Chancellor, wanted an unified German State under Prussian hegemony. That meant excluding Austria, even if it had to be done by force. So just a few months after the victory against Denmark, Prussia was already looking for a pretext for declaring war on Austria.
