Drive to the Sea

June 6, 1944

	For well over two years, the German High Command had known that the Allies would eventually try to land somewhere in France. The day is now.
	
The Germans must inflict a severe enough defeat that the Allies begin evacuating the beaches.

Note:  There is an Allied air base in north east on ocean hexes.  These represent air fields on the British Isles from which the Allied air missions are being launched.  It would be suicide for German air units to attempt to attack these air base hexes.

This scenario as modified is in no way historical.  It is a standalone version of the scenario as it would likely be played in the context of the Blitzkrieg campaign.  The forces deployed represent the kinds of forces that would likely be available to a player at this stage in the Blitzkrieg campaign.  The forces have also been balanced as much as possible to make the scenario balanced and hopefully, fun to play.

In defence of the historical perspective, this scenario follows a scenario in which the allies have been defeated in their attempt to gain a bridgehead on the Italian penninsula.  In that context the force compositions make a great deal more historical sense.
