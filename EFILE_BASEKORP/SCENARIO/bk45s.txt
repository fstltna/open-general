The Allies have launched Operation Dragoon at us. They think this is our "soft underbelly" but you will teach them they are wrong.
The Allies have landed paratroops in the area and have Naval support. You must crush there beachheads before they can reinforce. This will be tough , Herr General. Good luck!
