HQ 2nd Air Fleet, Greece
General Albert Kesselring

General, our victories in the Caucasus and North Africa has given us new opportunities to strike elsewhere. General Rommel with the Africa Corps stands at the Suez Canal ready to cross the Sinai. You will command an airborne attack to cut the British supply line in Syria by occupying Damascus. Speed is essential - a British tank division is on its way. Good luck, General!

AUXIN - 4 Air-landing Regiments & Air-Support
HINT - Expect counter-attacks from southwest.
