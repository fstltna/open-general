My men, I'm proud of you. The Soviet 13th Army has been virtually destroyed, Orel is in our hands and the road to Tula is open. But we must be cautious. The Reds have sent reinforcements from the Baltic, and they're about to attack our flank. We'll have to hold our positions and deal with this new threat before advancing any further.
