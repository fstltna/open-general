LWOW (20 August 1920)

Comrade there lays the old city of Lwow.  It was the goal of the Tsar in 1914, Brusilov in 1916 and our goal in 1920.  The goal of the Revolution!

Our Red Army is closing in on the city from the north and east.  Do I have to tell you about the instructions from Moscow?  They are expecting the Red Flag of the Revolution in Lwow as soon as possible!  Divisions of our Fourteenth Army are closely following your cavalry.  Polish resistance is unknown although interrogations have reported that the Poles bought time at Zadworze for defensive and offensive operations.  I believe these are capitalistic and criminal lies imprinted on the Polish soldiers.

Go, comrade, liberate Lwow!!!
