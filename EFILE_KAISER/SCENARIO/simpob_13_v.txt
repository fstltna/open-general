I guess that most of you have seen copies of that historical photograph of Kappel and Wrangel shaking their hands when they finally met in Saratov. In my living room I have a framed one, signed by both of them. Having contributed to the union of the two main anti-Bolshevik forces is one of the greatest things that I've ever done. I'm proud of having fought in Saratov.

Almost at the same time, the Siberian Army took Nizhni Novgorod and the AFSR defeated the Soviet Army in Tula. The war was almost won, so we started to think about what would come next. In a conference that took place in Tsarytsin, it was decided that a Military Directory would govern Russia until the revolution was completeley defeated. Naturally, Admiral Kolchak was chosen as its President. The first decision of the Directory was to order a final, coordinated assault on Moscow.
