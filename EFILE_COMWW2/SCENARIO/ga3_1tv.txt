Despite fierce enemy resistance, you have succeeded! This is our first "big" victory against the Invaders. The importance of this Victory as a morale booster cannot be under estimated! The threat of a Soviet division getting behind our lines has been neutralized, and the 139th division has been hit very hard. Now your skills are again needed, even further North, where we are planning to retake Suomussalmi.....
