Through the Front Line

February 15th, 1918

In 1917, the  Russian Empire collapsed and divided. Civil war had begun and in the winter of 1918 the Central Powers signed a peace treaty with Russia and with the newly created Ukraine. It was called the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. 

In Poland, which was mentioned in the treaty because part of the Polish territories were ceded to the Ukraine as well, its signing caused riots and protests. It meant an end to any support for the Central Powers.

Also units of the Polska Si³a Zbrojna mutineed against the Central Powers.
Soldiers of Polski Korpus Posilkowy, mainly veterans of 2nd Brigade of Legiony, decided to break through the frontline. 

Victory conditions: Break through enemy lines, reach Ukrainian positions and EVACUATE at least 3 units (core or auxilary). 1st infantry unit must survive.

Intelligence report: Two roads leads north. The western road is guarded by German units while the eastern is guarded by Austrian units. Choose one.
Transport for infantry will speed up their movements. 
Speed is vital, so take care of the auxiliary recon units.

Good Luck!
