05. A Lonesome Fortress (28 October 1944)

It took years before the Allies felt ready to invade France.  This summer they have done so. Now, months later, the German border is within sight, and France liberated in all but a few cities.  The Germans have left behind garrisons in some French ports.  The ports of Brest, Le Havre, Boulogne and Calais have all been captured, though with furious resistance.  Dunkirk has successfully resisted the Canadian and British forces.  It is up to your force, the Czechoslovak Independent Armored Brigade Group (C.I.A.B.G.) to take over the siege of Dunkirk.

Intelligence can tell us little about the strength of the German garrison but experience at other Channel ports do not tell an amusing story.  You have been given orders to contain the garrison and patrol aggressively;  taking out enemy strong points when possible.  A heavy toll of life and material should be avoided because Dunkirk is not worth it.

On 28 October an attack will be executed from the east with a diversionary attack in the center.  Good luck!
