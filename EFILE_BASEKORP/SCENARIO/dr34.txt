Königsberg - January 1945

After your stunning victory in the Ardennes offensive, which has rendered Antwerpen inoperable as a port for quite some time, destroyed a large part of the tactical air force of the allies in northern France and destroyed several American divisions and shattered others, the SS Panzerkorps have been redeployed to East Prussia to face the ongoing Soviet offensive towards Königsberg.

Unbeknownst to GröFaZ, the local troops have been communicating with Heeresgruppe Kurland to open up a corridor to let the trapped troops into East Prussia. You, the commander, have enthusiastically adapted this plan.

You need to defeat the offensive of the 39th and 5th Armies and crush through the 43rd Army. Heeresgruppe Kurland forces will arrive from the north, and together, you must stop the Soviet offensive.
