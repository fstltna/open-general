1936-45 PORTUGUESE CAMPAIGN

Portugal has ambition. When the Civil War in Spain breaks out, Portuguese forces help Franco control the border with Portugal. Portugal hates to see the Socialist troops so close to its own borders. But when World War 2 breaks out, German submarines use Portuguese waters to operate in and then Portugal re-news its old alliance with Britain dating from 1373 and joins the Allies against the Axis. A Portuguese Expeditionary Force will be used in operations in Italian controlled Ethiopia, Vichy French Madagascar and Morocco. Against the Germans and Italians in Tunisia and finally it will fight in Italy where almost all nations that have joined the Allies are fighting!
