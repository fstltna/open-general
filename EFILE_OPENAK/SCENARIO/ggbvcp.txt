Good work Herr General, time to press our advantage.

On May 22nd, the 20th Guards Brigade comprising Irish and Welsh Guards was taken to Boulogne, escorted by 3 destroyers. On May 24th the Germans carried out a head-on attack using siege ladders, and supported by artillery fire, flame throwers and fire from anti-aircraft guns. By the end of the day they had captured the citadel. While not as famous as the defence of Calais, the defence of Boulogne played a part in delaying the German advance. For years it was the practice of the officers of the 68 Company RPC to drink a toast to "The Defenders of Boulogne". When Boulogne fell to the Germans on May 25 Winston Churchill sent a wire to the commander at Calais, "Every hour you continue to exist is of the greatest help to the BEF. Government has therefore decided you must continue to fight. Have greatest possible admiration for your splendid stand. Evacuation will not (repeat not) take place, and craft required for above purpose are to return to Dover...." The 30th Brigade at Calais, was 2nd Battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps (KRRC), 1st Battalion, The Rifle Brigade (RB), and 1st Battalion, Queen Victoria's Rifles (QVR). German tanks were held up for half an hour by 1st Searchlight Battery. The defense of Calais is a story of determination against enormous odds that contributed to the successful evacuation at Dunkirk.
