General!

Your troop's attack on the left seem to run into a brick wall, I am concerned over your losses, can you even hold your lines?

You and your men fought bravely yet everywhere it seems the Russians stop our attacks, you must join me in signing this after battle report that specifically mentions that our tanks are having increasing problems in dealing with the Russian heavy armor.....

We are both to report to Armygruppe HQ, it was good to serve with you.........
