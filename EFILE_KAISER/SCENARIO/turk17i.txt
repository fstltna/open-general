Second battle of Inonu - March 27th, 1921

When the year 1921 started it was quite obvious that although, on paper, the United Kingdom, France and Italy still support the foreign occupation of Anadolu, if we resist long enough, they will end up looking for another kind of agreement.

But Greece is a different matter. The Greeks consider themselves the true heirs of the Byzantine Empire, and they want to annex as much Anadolu land as they can. The Treaty of Sèvres granted Greece a protectorate over Izmir, but that is simply not enough for them.
Since October 1920, the Greek army advanced further east into Anadolu, and nothing could stop them until three months later, when a Greek reconnaissance force was stopped here, at Inonu, by the army of the Grand National Assembly.

The Greeks weren't affected by this minor setback, and soon prepared a much larger army. They are confident that this time they will overcome our defences at Inonu, and they don't seem to care about the fact that we have reinforced ourselves, too. As a result, a major battle will take place very soon.
