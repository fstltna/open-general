These are grave times indeed.  The Feuhrer has been assassinated.  Perhaps now this madness can end.  Your string of victories has given us a position to negotiate from, however weak it may be.  You have done all we could ask of you and more, and you may have saved the lives of many of your countrymen.  The forces arrayed against us cannot be stopped, but perhaps we will escape this slaughter with our nation intact.

You have served the Fatherland well, and given us a chance for peace before the final blows fall, and if there is any wisdom left in the world we will avoid another Versailles.
