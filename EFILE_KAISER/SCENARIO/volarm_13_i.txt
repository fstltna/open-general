Tula

Nov 3rd, 1919

After my victory at Orel it was easy to reach Plavsk, 20 miles from Moscow. But the Bolsheviks have shown a remarkable ability for military logistics. Somehow they have managed to build a defence line south of Tula, and they have sent six fresh divisions from the Voronezh and Tsaritsyn fronts. I'll need all my skill in order to defeat the Reds and continue my march on Moscow. 
The good news are that, trying to stop me, the Bolsheviks have weakened their left flank. Wrangel could take advantage of that and start an advance up the Volga. Then he could finally link with Kolchak's Siberian forces. So the Soviet's obsession with me could lead them to disaster, as long as I can take Tula.

Victory conditions: 
- Take all the VHs.
