We didn't expect that the Italian lines would fall so easily. If we had known that the infiltration tactics would work so well our offensive would have been much larger, with the intention of kicking Italy out of the war. But now we lack the manpower and the supplies that we'd need to do that, so although we'll be able to advance many kilometers into Italian territory, sooner or later we'll have to stop and dig in.
It doesn't matter. We've taken thousands of prisoners, and Austria-Hungary is safe for the moment. The Italians won't dare to attack them for some time.
The situation is worse in the Western Front. The French have been relatively quiet since the failure of the Nivelle Offensive, but the British have taken us to the limit. In spring they defeated us at Messines, and after that we could hardly resist them at Passendale. If they try again this year I don't know what could happen.
