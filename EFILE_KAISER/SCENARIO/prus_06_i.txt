Schlacht bei Wörth

Aug 6th, 1870

After 1866 the relations between France and Prussia deteriorated very quickly. Emperor Napoleon III was an obstacle to the final unification of Germany, and Bismarck was searching for a new war in order to advance his political agenda.

A new source of tension emerged after 1868, when a liberal coup dethroned Queen Isabel II of Spain. The Spanish provisional government started to search for a new king among different European noble families, and one of the candidates was the Prussian prince Leopold von Hohenzollern. Napoleon III strongly opposed this, fearing a German-Spanish alliance that would isolate France, so Leopold's candidacy was finally retired.

But on 13 July 1870 Count Benedetti, the French ambassador to Prussia, approached King Wilhelm I at the spa of Ems, and demanded guarantees that Prussia wouldn't permit the candidacy of another Hohenzollern prince to the Spanish throne. The king politely refused, and under normal circumstances the issue should have ended there.

But Bismarck edited the official report of the incident, making it appear as a harsh argument between the king and the ambassador. Bismarck`s version was sent to the foreign embassies and the press, and in France it was seen as an insult by both the government and the people. On 19 July 1870 France declared war on Prussia, the southern German states supported Prussia, and Bismarck was delighted.

The first action of the Franco-Prussian War took place on 4 August 1870, when the forces of the German coalition took Wissembourg, in Alsace. Two days later, the German Third Army attacked again near Wörth, some 16 km west from Wissembourg. Although badly outnumbered, the French were ready for a fierce resistance.
