06. CASABLANCA (8 November 1942)

Part of a huge pincer movement in North Africa, the Allies, now the United States included, will at Vichy French territory in North Africa. While the British 8th Army advances from Egypt, Allied forces will land in Algeria and Marocco, so close to our beloved Portugal. 

Your PEF will be used in the invasion of Morocco, being part of the Western Taskforce under command of General Patton. All other forces landing in Morocco will be American. However the Portuguese Expeditionary Force has been chosen for the direct attack on Casablance. You will be assisted by troops of US 3rd Infantry Division landing to the east of Casablanca at Fedala. The enemy is again Vichy France. However, since the action on Madagascar, the political situation has changed. But we expect heavy resistance at the beaches. So be prepared. Good luck, General!
