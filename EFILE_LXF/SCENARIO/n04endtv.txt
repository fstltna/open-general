We have been betrayed!!! Almost a third of your forces were Southerners forcibly conscripted and untrained.  Capitalist spies must have passed knowledge of our plans to the Americans.  We have suffered enormous losses!  Comrade General, you will not be demoted for this failure.  What?  I see.  It is indeed wise that you have ordered your men to entrench themselves in their current position.  Follow me to my headquarters for further briefing on our situation.

AFTERMATH

Before the last North Korean attack on the Pusan Perimeter had faded away the US 8th Army had started its counteroffensive.  They even broke through the North Korean line in some sectors.  To make matters worse on 15 September 1950 General MacArthur launched an amphibious invasion against Inch'on near Seoul.  In subsequent operations Seoul was captured by the US Army X Corps.  The few North Korean units present offered tough but brief resistance.  Ten days had past since the landing at Inch'on.  By 23 September the North Korean army, what was left of it, was in full retreat back towards North Korea by every possible route it could find.
