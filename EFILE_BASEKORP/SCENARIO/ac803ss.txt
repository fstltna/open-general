Good to see you General!  

The initial landings that took Oslo by storm took the Allies completely by surprise!

As other German forces head far north To Narvick, we shall continue the drive from Oslo to Lillehammer.

The left will be my 163rd Infantry Division, Your forces will take the right.

STAFF INTEL: The Luftwaffe is completely occupied up north, but our air forces will be sufficient - resistance should be mostly light and we should be able to complete the drive in just a few days.
