Splendid! We've almost reached the Greek border, and now Italy will have to spend many men and resources securing the new front line. The plan has worked.

Confidentially, I inform you that the Kaiser wishes that the war came to an end. He'd be willing to sign a separate peace with the Entente powers if they agreed to respect the statu quo ante bellum.  Your victory in Albania could give us some leverage in case the peace negotiations ever start. However, I don't think that will happen. Our enemies won't accept anything but the total partition of the Empire, and I doubt that Germany allowed us to retire peacefully from this war. On the other hand, if our allies discovered the intentions of our Kaiser, maybe that would finally convince the Germans that something needs to be done at the Isonzo front. If they really want us to remain in the war, they'll have to help us.
