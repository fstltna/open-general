04. SAMARA (26 May 1918)

After breaking with the Soviet authorities, the Czech Legion started to take over city after city along the railroads towards Wladiwostok. As it was still dispersed from east of the Urals in the east to almost the  Volga River in the west. Before long the Legion held power over a huge stretch of territory and was seen as one of the most dangerous enemies by the Soviet leaders in Moscow. In an attempt to secure itself the Czech Legion carried out attacks on Soviet cities. Tsjeljabinsk and Ufa had already been taken. Samara on the Volga River would be next.

Your are ordered to use the railroads to reach Samara on the Volga River. No doubt the Soviets will attempt to slow you down on the way to buy time to prepare defenses of Samara. You veterans must overcome all difficulties and clear Samara from Bolsheviks.
