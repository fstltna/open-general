Smolensker Offensive
Now it is time for our big offensive. You will attack the German Heeresgruppe Mitte at Yelnya. The Germans are well prepared for our attack, but I am sure you will be able to break through their lines.
Your troops:
You will only have your tank army for this mission.
Enemy troops:
The Heeresgruppe Mitte still have strong troops, but they have only few tanks. On the other side you have to calculate with strong fire of high-range artillery and the German Luftwaffe has strong bomber forces in this area. The areas behind the bridges are well prepared for your attack, but if you are breaken through the resistance will be smaller.
