The Bolsheviks, after their defeat, didn't dare to go after us. We could embark calmly in Sevastopol and here we are now, sailing the Black Sea on our way to the exile. Only a handful of our former soldiers decided to stay and try their luck living in a Red Russia.

I did my best to recover my country, but in the end we were defeated. Now I suppose that I'll settle in Sweden with my family. Except for Anatoly, of course. His wife, his newborn baby and himself will go to Spain, where he hopes to join its colonial army. The idea of a new adventure sounds tempting, but I think that I'm too old for that. I wish my son the best, but for me the military life has finished.

The campaign is over. I hope you've liked it, and thanks for playing.
