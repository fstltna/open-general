Situation report: The Japanese fighter bases around Lae have long been a thorn in our side. Most of the top Japanese air aces have come from the Lae air groups. Unable to defeat them in the air, we finally have a chance to take them from the ground. A concerted effort by all the allied forces should overrun the airfields.

Operational orders: Use any method at your disposal to capture the airfields around Lae. There are many options to choose from including sea transport. As operational commander, the choice is yours to take. Japanese resistance is expected to be the toughest we have encountered yet.
