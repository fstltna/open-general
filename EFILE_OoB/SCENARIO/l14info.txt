14. DJAKOVO (4 April 1945)

To the commanding officer of 22. ID (LL):

The Division has now crossed the Sava River and retreats over the more furtile grounds of Syrmia in Croatia. The route towards Zagreb has been blocked by Yugoslav partisans near the town of Djakovo.

Your division will come from the south and try to reach Djakovo. From the east 7. SS Gebirgsjager Division is retreating under heavy pressure of Yugoslav divisions which are now invading Croatia. Djakovo itself is still in the hands of the Croat 369. Infanterie Division but can be attacked by enemy partisans anytime. 

Thusfar we have held a frontline and never have been forced to leave units behind. This time no exception will be made. Djakovo must be reached!


RULES: 
- Do not upgrade, sell or buy units - nor upgrading transports.
- Replacing lost units is not allowed anymore.
