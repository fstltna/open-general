Message from General Sanjurjo Sacanell's HQ:

You have been too slow! We couldn't conquer our objectives in time and now the Berber counterattacks are about to expel us from the beachheads. The whole operation has been a failure! We'll be forced into pact with Abd el-Krim and give up our interests in northern Morocco.

You must accept your responsability in this disaster, General. You will soon be judged at a general court martial. Now get out of my sight!


The campaign is over, but I think that you should replay the last scenario...
