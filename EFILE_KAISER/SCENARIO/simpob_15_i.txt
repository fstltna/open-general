As though nothing could fall: Klin

December 30th, 1919

The Bolsheviks had decided to make a last stand near Moscow, hoping to delay our advance. That way, they would gain enough time to finish a strong defensive line in Petrograd. 

We were not going to tolerate that. The final victory against the communists was too close for that. We travelled as fast as we could and we deployed our forces south of Klin. We were eager to win a last battle against the hateful Soviets.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.
