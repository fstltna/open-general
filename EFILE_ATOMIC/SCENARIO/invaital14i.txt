Orders:

After crossing the Apennine mountains and clearing the coast your next task will be the liberation of the cities of Bologne and Modena. When both cities are in our hands and the surrounding area is secure you will push further northwards into the Po river valley. Reaching the Po river will be our final objective as well as the destruction of the last remnants of the german forces. Victory is close and it will be ours! Good luck, commander!

Note:

You will start this scenario without an airfield, so you may want to build one.
