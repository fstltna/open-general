The 2 Panzers of Gruppe 'Husmann parked by the Cafe.SS security was rounding up the French  hauling them off."Hey look Savannah,isn't that Betta Wohr"? "Looks like Her".The Girls had the Security bring Her over.She denied being Betta but didn't know who She was but She was not "the hated SS Witches".Savannah had the Security raise the Girls skirt and pull Her panties down a little telling them there should be a Heart tattoo on Her left Bun with the Word 'Dieter'.Sure enough there it was and then Savannah showed the same but with the name 'Franz."Betta don't You remember that Weekend in Slausenhamm,You know, 'Kitties House'?The bike ride,that Major about running over Our Asses and Dieter beating the crap out of Him.You have to remember that, if You hadn't told Dieter to stop He would have killed the Guy".But Betta Wohr could not remember.The Girls kept Betta with them prodding and questioning though Wohr kept telling them they was "both insane and just let Her go with the 'Decent' People and be interned for in the near future the SS was going to get their asses kicked by the Brits all the way back to Berlin".So Betta was prodded through the night and next day turned over to a Medical unit.6 months later convalessing at home She heard the name 'Triks for the 100th time and Her Mind let loose the Death of the Panzer crew being killed while She was spared by the hand of fate.Another 4 months and Betta would be a hated 'SS Witch' in a Panzer again.
