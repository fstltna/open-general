Battle of Prague
Berlin is captured by our troops. Now we want to destroy the remaining German armies in Czechia and in Slovakia and free Prague. You have to broke through the German lines at Nagysallo and move north.
Your troops: 
The 2nd Ukrainian Front will assist your attack on the German lines. Also, some Romanian, Czech and Polish troops will be under your command. Unfortunately, there is no airfield in this area. So, you have to build one, before your planes can start.
Enemy troops:
You are facing the 8th Army. These troops have lost much of their strength but they were supplied with some serious prototypes in the last days. The Germans have some new fighters in the area, but there is no airfield in the near, so, the fighters can support the German troops only a few days.
