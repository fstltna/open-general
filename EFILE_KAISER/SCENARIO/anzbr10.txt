Brief to Anzac Commander.

Your main objective is the town of Beersheba with it's airstrip which is vital to the Royal Flying Corp. Also capturing the road junction to the north will stop any Turk reinforcements retaking Beersheba. I can't stress how important this mission is to our continued campiagn here in the Middle East!!!!
