I have great news General! Mussolini has been overthrown!, and, we are currently in secret negotiations with the new Italian government. They want to surrender! But, it has not been officially announced yet. Nevertheless, we will continue with the invasion of Italy; hopefully this will "hasten" their decision, and thus trap the Germans into fighting in a hostile country. Good luck General....
