Wonderful Herr General! The Fuhrer is extremely pleased! You have captured the city of Stalingrad, and now we can again give full focus to the original goal of Case Blue, the Oilfields! You and your men are being ordered to link up with our forces advancing from Rostov into the Caucasus towards Maikop..
