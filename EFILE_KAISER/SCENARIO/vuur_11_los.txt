We've been defeated and I'm afraid that the war will soon be over. Our commando could still fight for some time, but most of the other commandoes are exhausted and without any proper equipment. We've fought until the bitter end, but now we must stop, before we lose everything we have left.
General Botha says that the British will give us lots of money for reconstruction and they have promised that, although our republics have been annexed, they will eventually grant us limited self-government. It's still a cruel destiny for our people, but we'll be forced to accept it.

And in the future, who knows? Despite all our suffering, there are still more Afrikaners than British in South Africa. Our families are bigger than theirs. We could be a majority in South African politics. Maybe some day the British will wake up and discover that they took our lands, but on doing so they also allowed us to control the whole country. 

The campaign is over. I hope you've liked it and thanks for playing.
