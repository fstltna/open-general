Congratulations! The city of Melilla is saved!

Due to your outstanding performance and leadership on the field of battle, you will be recommended for promotion to "Capitán".

A new assignment is waiting for you.

Historical background:

Lacking artillery Rifians failed to take Melilla. Spanish reinforcements soon arrived. However, it took several months of fierce fight and heavy losses, including General Margallo, commander of the Spanish forces, to dislodge the Rifians sieging Melilla. They had expanded their trenches around the city and set up fortified camps, blocking off all communication between the city and the outlying forts. 

Only when Spain sent sufficient reinforcements and began to apply its naval power to full effect Rifians requested peace negotiations. Sultan Hassan I of Morocco recognized Spanish grievances and reaffirmed Spain's right to improve Melilla defences. 

For the first time, Spanish troops wielded the formidable 7 mm Mauser Model 1893's.
