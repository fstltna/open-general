Herr General, we have an excellent opportunity to deliver a crushing blow to the enemy, here, north of Strasbourg. As you can see, the advance of the American Third Army has left this sector of their front inadequately defended. If you can knife through to Strasbourg, the Americans and British will be forced to halt their drive on the Fatherland.

As you know, due to the enemy's campaign of terror bombing we are experiencing temporary fuel shortages.  You are expected to capture enemy supplies and use them as we reprise our glorious victories in the Ardennes.

You should also be aware that the allies will be sending in reinforcements from the west throughout the battle.  We expect them to arrive in the vicinity of the villages Rehrbaon, Puberg and La-Petite-Pierre, as well as the city of Saverne.  Be prepared for this eventuality.  
Good luck.

Note:  New units and prototypes start this scenario with 150 experience points.
