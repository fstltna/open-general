Narva Retreat
November 27, 1918

Kolonelleitnant, it is good that your regiment has been training on the border.  The Red Army has launched an offensive against Estonia and our White Russian allies along two axes:  from the south-east with the aims of Pskov, Tartu and along the Baltic Sea with the aims of Narva, Rakvere, Tallinn.  It appears that the Reds have been held up at Pskov, so your regiment must relocate to Narva as quickly as possible.

The defenders of Narva include the local 4th regiment and remnants of the German 405th.  It is unfortunate, but we must retreat from the city in the face of overwhelming Soviet forces.  Following a massive naval operation by the Soviets, a large contingent of enemy troops has captured territory to the west of Narva.  To make matters even worse, there are Estonian traitors fighting for the Reds to the south-west of the city.  Your objective is to provide for a secure evacuation of the Narva garrison.  To fulfill your mission, you must:
1. Hold Narva until you capture all other objectives
2. Clear the Tallinn-Narva railroad of all enemy activity
3. Destroy the base of operations of Soviet naval infantry forces in the village of Udria.
You will receive reinforcements from the Rakvere 5th regiment, supported by Estonia's first armored train.
Good luck, Kolonelleitnant.

NOTE: a Brilliant Victory is not possible in this scenario.
