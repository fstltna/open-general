In Desert

Part 2/3 of the "In der Wueste und auf Kreta" minicampaign


Herr General, our situation is even worse than we expected. The oasis is occupied by the Commonwealth forces. Oberst says that there are at least two or three infatry battalions spread across the whole area, road and pathways are blocked with static defense and MGs, deeper in the camp there are artillery batteries under cover of autocannons. 



Victory condition: Exit the map with 12 units.

Hint: You are lost deep in the desert. There's a wellspring in the oasis (represented by the Retreat Hex), so just let your men quench their thirst there... right after you defeat or evict the defenders. 
You don't need to guard your starting VH.
