Situation report: The Dutch have asked us for our help in recovering their oilfields at Tarakan.  As one of the last remaining supplies of oil for the Japanese Fleet, the Japanese have heavily garrisoned and fortified the region. 

Operational orders: You are assigned to accompany units of the Netherlands Army in a seaborne assault on Tarakan. We are expecting very heavy opposition but we are expecting you to prevail. The Japanese fleet will also be likely to put in an appearance.
