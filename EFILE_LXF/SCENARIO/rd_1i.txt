Ah, welcome comrade General!  Allow me to brief you on the tactical situation, and the reasons for which you were called here:

The citizens of Bialystok are agitating for the return of Polish independence.  Unfortunately, it seems that some units of the former Polish Army were able to evade our men during our brief campaign through Poland, and these units have quickly seized the area from our local garrision.

This rebellion forces us to divert your forces from the front in Germany, comrade General.  You must crush the insurrection quickly and with force.  Paratroopers will be arriving shortly to assist your men.

Show no mercy, Comrade.   Stalin himself has ordered that the villages be razed to the ground.
