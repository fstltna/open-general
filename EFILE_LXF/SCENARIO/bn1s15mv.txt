General Walter Model

General that was good! You and your men displayed great courage. We crossed the River Maas and our troops continue to advance. I only hope that we continue to have bad weather so the Allied air force remains on ground. Your paratrooper corps is being pulled back for training. A great airborne operation is being planned against the Russian war industry.
