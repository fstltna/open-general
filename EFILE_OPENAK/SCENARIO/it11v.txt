OPERATION BREVITY May 1941 - V

The British Operation looked initially succesful, but the counterattack of our Panzer Regiments forced Gott to retreat to Halfaya. Gott seemed to have orders to hold Halfaya as a good starting point for the upcoming offensive, but abandoned the pass when our forces threathened to surround him.

News: German and Italian troops have captured Greece. The attack on Crete will start on the 20th of this month.
