General,

You restored some semblance of order, but still further south the situation is disastrous, you will now withdraw along the Warta to Frankfurt a/d Oder as soon as possible. Maybe we can still stop the Soviets with our troops arriving from the west.

There is also a ray of hope: since our cease-fire with the west the synthetic oil production has picked up surprisingly fast, and more and more new jet plains are batteling for the skies over Silesia.
