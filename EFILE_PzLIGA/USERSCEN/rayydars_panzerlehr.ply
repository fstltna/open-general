Panzerlehrdivison

Tovarishtsh General!
Once again our famous Red Army, due to the ingenious ideas of Tovarishtsh Stalin, broke through the Fascist lines north and south a front projection of the Axis and is about to encircle a whole army group.

The Axis troops are already completely decimated and demoralized by the powerful impacts of our glorious workers' and farmers' army.  

In the east we are driving the Fascists out of their holes. At the flanks our fast mechanized forces are about to close the trap far in the west and afterwards to smash the pocket. 

But CAUTION! As the supreme command Stavka just communicates, the fully replenished PANZERLEHR division of the Fascists is somewhere in this front section! So beware of bad surprise!  
-----------------------------------------
Herr General!
It does not look too good at your front section. Our air reconnaissance just announces that, due to the unconditional order to hold, a precarious front projection has formed. On both flanks of your army the Russians have already advanced far to the West and probably plan to build a pocket of enormous extent.  

Despite the unsatisfactory equipment and the precarious personnel level as well as the composition of your troops they must settle the situation in the North and the South and accomplish a shortening of the front, altogether!  

Therefore, the OKW (Wehrmacht Supreme HQ)
