The Turkish 3rd Army, having begun the offensive against Sarykamysh with over 110,000 poorly prepared men have managed to seize control of the fortress from your incapable hands!  Some reports indicate that the Turkish army has left nearly 90,000 men dead on the frozen slopes of the Araks valley, yet your panic-striken dispatches led the Front to believe your defenders were overwhelmed.  An investigation into your subversive activities has been launched-the result of which you will await under arrest.
