
JERUSALEM - 10 JUN 1941

Shilta, Palestine

Jerusalem is not a goal of strategic importance, but have some symbolic value. Commonwealth troops entrenched there to secure the withdrawal of their comrades to Iraq. But without tanks and adequate air support, their defense is hopeless. Take the holy city, and gather your troops after our victory on the Trans-Jordanian border!

GOAL: Take all VH's!
