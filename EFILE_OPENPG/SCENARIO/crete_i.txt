The assault on Crete will be the largest airborne drop ever attempted. It is up to you to lead the airborne attack and capture airfields in Crete so that your main forces can aid the invasion by both sea and air to crush the Allies on the island. You must ultimately secure all of the objectives on Crete by June 1st at the latest. In order to ensure that our forces are optimally prepared for the upcoming invasion of Russia, a much earlier success is desirable.
