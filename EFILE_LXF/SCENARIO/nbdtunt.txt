You managed a win, but your advance was much too slow. Our British allies took a terrible beating as did many of your own units. We had planned a quick assault into Italy in a few weeks, but as a result of these casualties we may have to rearrange our timetable. We have, however, secured North Africa and can now look towards Europe.
