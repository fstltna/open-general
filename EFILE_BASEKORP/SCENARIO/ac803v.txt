Good to see you again General!

Our drive from Oslo to Lillehammer went as we expected, and soon the Norwegian Government should capitulate!

I must commend your forces, your drive up the right was on time despite this rugged country.  I was happy to report directly to the Furher himself of our success, he sends you his gratitude.

Cheers General!
