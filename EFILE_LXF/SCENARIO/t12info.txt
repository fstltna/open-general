Russia has finally lost the southern part of their country from the Caucasus region to the vicinity of Stalingrad. Our part is Russia is completed. And for weeks, preparations are being made for the invasion of Egypt, our old desire. Our positions at the border of Egypt and Palestine are good with the desert in front of us. Our first onbjective, before we reach the Suez canal, will be the defeat of the British forces in the border area and the conquest of El Arish. For the last months the British have raided our positions and we did the same back and we know about the British is that they have some old forts at the border. Further on Intelligence reports that there is much activity and it is almost sure that reinforcements are on their way to El Arish so it's not clear how the British troops will react. But reinforcements from our side are also underway and we can count on your experience in warfare and tactical skills to succeed and capture El Arish! Good luck, General.
