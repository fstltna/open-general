Bzura Pocket

We have the chance to encircle and destroy the Army of Poznan. As we thought, the enemy is withdrawing their units to Warsaw; they need to cross the Bzura and the Vistula to get there. Our plan is to block their way to Warsaw, enclosing all the remants of the Poznan Army into a ''pocket'' with the aid of the rivers. Then, you should destroy the enemy forces enclosed in the trap. Luftwaffe units will arrive to help you; also, units from the 3. Armee are available to help you from the North as well as more units from the 8. Armee. Good Luck.
