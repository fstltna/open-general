Herr General,

At first we thought the invasion of Crete was a goal in itself. Only meant to secure mediterrenean shipping, and to establish an airbase for bombarding Ploesti. Clearly this was not the case: it seems the western allies feel they are not strong enough yet to invade France and have therefore choosen first to gain a foothold in the Balkans that will tie up some of our forces and secure their influence there.

Your orders are to throw the landings on the southern Pelloponese back into the sea. However, a massive airlanding near Corinth threatens to cut of your supply lines. I secretly but urgently advise you to give up your positions in the South and to throw everything you have against these paratroopers. An escape to Attica is your best option.
