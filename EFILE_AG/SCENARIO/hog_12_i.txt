50 B.C. : The liberation of the Etruscans
 
[The Supreme druid approaches towards you:] 
... as far as the long-term planning of our campaign is concerned,
I would say that we should encircle and conquer Rome as soon as possible ....instead of fighting a protracted, energy-consuming war like Hannibal .....

And we should apply Alexander's strategy: 
first, we should carefully advance the west coast and take all port cities along our way south ...
So we can prevent a landing of the Roman veteran legions in our area and at the same time use the ports for our purposes .....

... On our way to Rome there are many old Etruscan cities ..... if we promise them independence and an alliance and much gold; and, of course, drive all Romans out of their country, they will perhaps join us ...
The Etruscans are known since ancient times as excellent technicians and teachers of the Romans: In front of Rome we will need a lot of modern siege equipment .....
... in addition, their fleet will be very useful to us ...
