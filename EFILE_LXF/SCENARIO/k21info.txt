21. KOLBERG (4 March 1945)

TO: Grossadmiral
SUBJECT: Defense of Festung Kolberg and Marinekorps School

---The Soviets have started their attack on the German Fatherland. East Prussia, Silesia and Pomeria are under brutal attack. In Pomerania enemy troops have fought a way to the Baltic port of Kolberg. This is a special port because it holds our recruitment and trainings center of the Marinekorps!

The Fuhrer has labelled Kolberg a Festung so it must be defended. The garrison of Kolberg consists of Volkssturm and remnants of a French and Latvian SS division. However the Fuhrer has given an order to the Marinekorps to defend its base. You will hold the city at all costs. Hopefully the Fuhrer will soon give an evacuation order but until then, give all you and your men have!---

NOTE: Goal is to play the full 12 turns by holding Kolberg, and in addition gather prestige. Try to keep as many core units as possible alive while trying to gain as much experience as possible.
