Gospodin General-Major, your performance at Gumbinnen has not been a stunning success, but the Germans have been defeated decisively nonetheless.

General Rennekampf believes that the German 8th Army has begun its retreat following this defeat.  He has resolved to screen the fortress of Koenigsberg with the XX and III Corps to the north.  The IV and II Corps have the task of pursuing the enemy.  However, Rennekampf has ordered a cautious advance because of strained supply lines.

Meanwhile, Samsonov's 2nd Army has invaded from Russian Poland from the south.  We expect them to strike the retreating German army in the flank.  Your division will be part of Scheidman's II Corps and is tasked with making contact with Samsonov's forces...
