BATTLE OF VOLODARKA (29 May 1920)

Comrade, finally all of your command has arrived at the new front in the west.  The front against the Poles!  The newly emerged Polish state has invaded our sacred territory both in the Belarus as here in the Ukraine.  Kiev has fallen into Polish hands already but again the enemy is widespread and this offers chances to turn the tide!

Your force will assemble south of Kiev and attack the Polish positions well south of Kiev.  Your goal will be to force a way through the Polish line and open up a gap so we can pour in infantry and cut off the enemy at Kiev.  Your operation will be supported by the 3rd Don Cossack Brigade which is few days march behind you.
