STORY

In Chang Tsung-ch’ang’s defense sector, resistance was more dogged. Chang had bargained futilely for a "contribution" of $2 million from the Tientsin merchants’ associations in return for a bloodless and orderly retreat from their city. Thus frustrated, he laid down a vigorous barrage of heavy artillery against the approaching First CA’s attempt to ford the Hai River, upstream from Tientsin.

Because the large foreign concessions at Tientsin were situated on the south bank of the Hai River, the First CA approached from the west in order to avoid them - especially the Japanese concession, which would have been in a direct line of fire if Tientsin were approached from the south. Chiang had instructed the foreign diplomatic corps in Tientsin to "disarm all northerners who try to enter the foreign concessions..." and or dered the First CA to "...make no attempt to enter the foreign concessions.... We will do our best to handle the difficult situation in the most pacific manner."

KMT agents had been active in contacting Ankuochün officers since late 1927, and in the Tientsin campaign the efforts paid off. Dispatched from Nanking in late December 1927, Lu Ho-sheng had been working with northern officers offering them various incentives to defect or surrender. By June 1928, Lu had been able to deal with General Hsü Yüan-ch’uan of the Manchurian Sixth Army, units of which were reinforcing Chang Tsung-ch’ang’s sector around Tientsin. During a secret meeting on the night of June 7, Lu was so persuasive as to the futility of further efforts with the Ankuochün that Hsü turned himself and his troops over to the First CA outside Tientsin on June 11. The defection so weakened Chang Tsung-ch’ang’s line that it ended any hopes oi his retaining Tientsin and the remaining portion of the North China Plain. For Hsü the defection meant his reassignment to the Third CA of Yen Hsi-shan, in which he commanded his force as the Eleventh Corps (chün-t’uan), an arrangement that had many precedents in the Northern Expedition.

From June 11 when the Tientsin campaign ended through to September 3, the NRA under the Kwangsi general, Pai Ch’ung hsi, directed mopping-up operations against stragglers and isolated pockets of resistance east of Peking. Not until September 7, 1928, did Pai’s force, made up of elements of the four CAs, see real action. On that date the NRA found Chang Tsung ch’ang’s force lined up behind a defense system around T’angshan. After a two-day conflict, Chang was again in retreat toward Shan-hai-kuan, the gateway to Manchuria. His last stand along the Lüan River from September 15 to 23 failed when the NRA broke through and overwhelmed the defenders.
