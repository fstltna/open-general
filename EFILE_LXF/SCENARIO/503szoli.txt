09. Szolnok (Battle of Debrecen) 19-22 October 1944

General Pliyev's Mechanized Group is close to capture Debrecen, the largest city of the Hungarian Plain. If the Soviets succeeded, the VIII. Armee retreating from North-Transylvania would be completely cut off. General Fretter-Pico is planning a bold counterattack, but the Red Army overwhelmingly outnumbers the available German troops in the area. Your job is launching a diversionary attack from the Szolnok-Törökszentmiklós bridgehead and attract the attention as much Soviet divisions as possible and bleeding them out.

24. Panzer Division and 4. SS Pz.Grenadier Division are under your command, while the Hungarian 20th Infantry Division acts independently.
