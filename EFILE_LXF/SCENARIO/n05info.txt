WONSAN (10 October 1950)

Ah there you are, Comrade General.  That was a close encounter at that village near Kansong.  Fortunately we both made it out in time!  Quickly, we have no time to lose!  The enemy has crossed the border at the 38th Parallel and is now advancing into North Korea!  While the fury of our people can be seen in every village, our People's Army is in bad shape after retreating for hundreds of miles.  There are many troops fighting as partisans behind capitalist lines and in fact these few men and their equipment are the largest intact force we know of.  Naturally we are rebuilding our army deep in the mountains of North Korea and even across the border in Chinese owned Manchuria!

For now, you have other problems to deal with.  You have just reached the large port of Wonsan, but we cannot hold it for long.  Divisions of the capitalistic Southerners are close to Wonsan and might even try to cut off our route of retreat.  To buy us more time you must prevent this from happening and hold Wonsan as long as possible.  An untrained, fresh regiment of Communist Marines will be put under your command and even some mechanized guns are in the city.  We will meet in Hungnam next time!
