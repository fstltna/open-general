BRILLIANT VICTORY

Congratulations commander on another splendid performance.  Although the Germans were dazed and on the run they still managed to put up a stiff and competent resistance.  Now with the Reds closing in on Berlin and our successes here in the west, the war's outcome is in little doubt.  For you, the war is most definitely over, and you are to return to the UK to await your post-war assignment.
