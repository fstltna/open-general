Van, May 5 1915
Gospodin General-Leitenant, news of an Armenian revolt in the city of Van has reached Front Command.  The Front intends to use the opportunity to exploit this section of the Turkish front with a mobile force, link up with the Armenians at Van, and disrupt the Turkish rear communications.  The two cities of Van and Tabriz will serve as powerful springboards for a potential offensive against the Ottoman Empire's Persian lands.

You will lead Bayazetsky (Nikolaev) and Makinsky (Trukhin) Otriady.  Your mission is to swiftly break through the Turkish line toward Van.  May God speed your horses, Gospodin General-Leitenant!
