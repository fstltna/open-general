Battle of Dyneburg

January 3rd, 1920

Good Morning General! The liberation of Bialorus was the last Polish operation against the Reds in 1919. The second half of the year was all quiet. Meanwhile, the new Soviet Russians of Lenin fought against the White Russians of Denikin. But General Denikin not only refused to recognize the Polish state, but he also asked France (former Russian ally and current Polish ally) to stop supporting the Poles as well! Because of this, Polish authorities decided not to support Denikin’s forces and stopped all aggressive operations against the Red Army. This allowed the Bolsheviks to concentrate all available forces against the Whites and they were able to repel them.

By the end of 1919, General Smigly-Rydz decided to conduct a limited operation in the most distant northeastern front against the Red Army which occupied Dyneburg, the town that the Latvians called Daugavpils. Their goals were to link with the Latvians, secure their young independence, and to break the communication between the Bolsheviks and the Lithunian government in Kowno.  

Victory conditions: Together with our Latvian allies liberate Dyneburg - take all VHs.

Intelligence report: The weather is terrible: temperatures of -25 ºC (-13 ºF) and thick snow makes any air-support nearly impossible. The Soviet 15th Army is rather weak but hidden in strong fortifications. Be prepared because they use a lot of mines! If you move your infantry cautiously onto the minefield they will be able to possibly remove the mines!

Good luck!
