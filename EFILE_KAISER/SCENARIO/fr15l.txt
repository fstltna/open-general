The First World War - Third Ypres - Poelcapelle (Poelkapelle)- Oct 10th, 1917- L

Madame Bertaux-Levillain, I regret to inform you that your brave husband was killed by enemy artillery fire two days ago, while he was in the front line looking for weak points in the German defences. France regrets your loss, but I want to assure you that his service to our country will never be forgotten.

HISTORICAL EVENTS:

1917-JUL-31. Believing that they finally can open a gap in the German defences at the Ypres salient, the British launch an attack against Pilkem. Although initially successful, the heavy rains soon bogs the offensive down.

1917-AUG. During the wettest summer in 30 years, the British continue their slow progress, taking Westhoek and Langemarck.

1917-SEP-20- OCT-4. The British take Menin Road, Polygon Wood and Broodseinde. The Germans start to think that a general withdrawal is unavoidable.

1917-OCT-9. The British and the French attack Poelcappelle and its surrounding areas. Although the operation is initially successfull, most of the taken ground is later lost to German counter-attacks.

1917-OCT-12. The Entente forces attack Passchendaele. Heavy rain and mud again make the British advance terribly difficult, and the assault must stop.

1917-OCT-26- NOV-10. The British finally capture Passchendaele, but the fierce German resistance makes a break through impossible. The trench warfare still goes on.
