Liushun

Nov 21st, 1894

Our troops left the Yalu river and arrived just in time in the fortified naval base of Liushun, called Port Arthur in Europe. Only a few days later the Second Japanese Army completed its disembark in Manchuria, and quickly marched towards Liushun, whose possession was vital for our enemies.

Although all the surviving Chinese warships were fleeing to Weihawei, my father in law somehow convinced the Beiyang Fleet to turn back and defend Liushun. We knew that the Japanese Navy was approaching, but after the Yalu river naval battle they were overconfident. They were sending a powerful, but small, advanced flotilla without any proper gunboat escort, and they didn't expect any Chinese warships in the area, so maybe they could be caught by surprise.

The town itself had impressive defences, both natural and man-made, but the quality and the morale of the local garrison were very poor. Were it not for our presence, I'm sure that the Japanese would have taken Liushun with little effort, causing a massacre among the Chinese. Now, at the very least, the Japanese would have to pay a high price for their victory.
