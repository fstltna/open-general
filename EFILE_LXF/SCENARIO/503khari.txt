It has rushed through the gap between our 4th Pz Army and Group Kempf and is now threatening Kharkov. Your Schwere Panzer Abteilung, a Kampfgruppe of the 3rd Pz Division, the 198ID and some other corps troops are defending the city. SS Panzer-Grenadier Division Das Reich will come to your assistence.
