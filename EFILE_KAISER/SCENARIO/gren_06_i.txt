Magersfontein

December 11th, 1899

Despite our victories, our advance was hard and slow. The Boer had had time to fortify themselves on the hills located along the railway line to Kimberley, south of the town. They knew that it was their last line of defense. If we managed to defeat them, we would force them to lift the siege, and Kimberley would be free at last. In order to reach that objective, we had recently been reinforced by the Highland Brigade.
Although our maps were not good and our scouts could not approach the Boer lines due to the amazing marksmanship of our enemies, we believed that most of the Boer defenders were entrenched on Magersfontein Ridge. Lord Methuen ordered us to make a night march towards Magersfontein, and then launch a frontal assault on the Boer at dawn, the following day.
