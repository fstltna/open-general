Zitadelle
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Herr General, as you know the Kursk Salient poses a serious threat to us. The enemy is counterattacking and our only hope to seal the break in the lines is your Kampfgruppe. You must stop the Soviet counterattack immediately. Good Luck. 

Victory Conditions:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Hold 8 VHs to get a BV/DV, 6 to a V, and 4 to a TV/MV

Note to players:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The fact that your aux units start the scenario without ammo and fuel is probably annoying, but it is not a bug and is indeed intended]
