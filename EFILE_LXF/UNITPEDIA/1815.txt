The 3-inch anti-aircraft gun M3 was an anti-aircraft gun developed from the earlier 3-inch M1917 and 3-inch M1918 guns which served throughout the 1930s, some into early World War II. By the time of the US entry into World War II, the 3-inch M3 was in the process of being replaced and may have seen action in the Pacific during World War II.
