11. MOTUPENA (1 January 1945)

Welcome to 29th Brigade, General! Expected is that in the southern part of Boungainville the Japanese have concentrated most of their operational strength on the island. Most of the agricultural riches of Bougainville are located in the south. To render the Japanese troops useless it is vital that we capture the southern part of Boungainville. The strategic goal is Buin at the southern tip of the island. However we will advance step by step!

The first objectives are the coastal villages of Tavera and Mawaraka. Your battalion will advance along the coast and capture these settlements. Next you have to advance to Motopena and clear the small peninsula where the town is settled. Meanwhile the 2/8 Commando Squadron will perform deep patrolling into the mountains. Good luck, commander!
