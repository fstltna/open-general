The Fortress Falls

03/29/1945

After the German counter attack had been stalled, the Soviets started their final assault on the Kuestrin Fortress. Two Guards Rifle Divisions with heavy artillery and air support were tasked with this important mission.

You have only 2 deploy hexes - both in the fortress. Think twice if and which unit you'd like to deploy - they might become sacrifices while trying to reach the retreat hex.
A loss is no shame (and will also send you to the next scen).
