Our armies are safe, comrade.  Thanks to your excellent rearguard duty slowing down the Polish army in the south long enough for us to retreat to better positions.  The front is stabilizing again locally.  Plus I have orders for our command to be pulled out of the frontline. That means rest and refitting for the first time in months!

Good news, comrade!  The capitalists in Warsaw realize that further struggles with the People's Republic will inevitably will lead their defeat!  Though not all of our claims have been recognized in the cease fire, we now have peace at our western borders!  That means we finally have a border instead of a front!

Sadly that is not true for the southern border...
