09. SEMENOV (10 February 1920)

Early 1920, the Legion was close to reaching Wladiwostok. At Irkutsk the Czech Legion traded the Imperial Gold Reserve and Koltsjak to the Soviets for a free passage further east. Being already east of Lake Baikal, it was thought no more fighting would take place. However these regions, east of Lake Baikal, were never under control by Koltsjak and a Cossack ruler, Ataman Semenov, ruled here. Semenov was supported by Japan and was initially hostile towards the Legion.

You must go further east towards Chita. Our goal remains leaving Russia and get home. Semenov's Transbaikal Cossacks might try to stop you and you have orders not to be stopped by anyone.
