Commander, you have been ordered to the Alieutian Islands. Hopefully the cold air will bring you back to reality. Cincpac has ordered the officers club there shut down in anticipation of your arrival. 
The situation here is critical. The Japanese control Attu and are preparing airbases to assault Dutch Harbor. You will need to disembark your troops on the east side of the island and destroy any Japanese there.
