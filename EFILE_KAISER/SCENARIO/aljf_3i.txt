21. 6. 1849, The decisive Battle at Waghäusel


Lieber Freund,
...the superior prussian Army has pushed us back over the Rhine River, but the People in Baden, and their whole army have joined the Revolution again !
...now, we are encircled by the enemy and we must fight for our lives and the Republic....


ORDERS:
Herr General, many enemies in every direction.....
But we are in a good strategical position, and the Baden Army has joined our side...
We must hold our lines...
If we win this, I'm sure there will be uprisings in all german States...
