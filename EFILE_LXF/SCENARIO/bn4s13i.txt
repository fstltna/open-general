STORY: After the communist inspired mutiny in April 1944 the 1st Greek Brigade was disbanded. The most "reliable" Greek soldiers were then formed into the 3rd Mountain Brigade under the command of Colonel Thrassivoulos Tsakalotos. The new formation consisted of three infantry battalions, a regiment of field artillery and attached support troops, approximately 3000 men. Some of the Greeks were veterans from Albania and El Alamein, but others were yet to see action.

At the request of the Greek Government and with the approval of the New Zealand Government, 3 Greek Mountain Brigade was placed under the aegis of the New Zealand Division. It fought at the Gothic Line in the Battle of Rimini in Italy (under I Canadian Corps), where it earned the honorific title "Rimini Brigade".

The Gothic Line, was a fortified line, running 320 km (199 miles) from Pesaro on the Adriatic to Massa Carrara on the Tyrrhenian sea, thick with Panzers, steel shelters, rock tunnellings of defence positions, deep minefields, etc. From the left bank of the river Foglia it had 2,376 machine-gun posts, 479 antitank guns, mortar and assault guns positions, 120 km (75 miles) of wire and many miles of antitank ditches.

3 Greek Mountain Brigade and the New Zealand troops, made contact with the enemy on September. The Greeks, with the support of Canadian mortars, machine guns and anti-tank guns, were sent into action to gain battle experience. By a perversity of fortune, these mountain troops were committed on the coastal flats, where they relieved a brigade of 1 Canadian Division (Major-General C. Vokes) on a front of about 2 km (1.2 miles).
