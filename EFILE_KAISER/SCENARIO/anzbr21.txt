Brief to Anzac Commander.

"Gentlemen, we may not make history tomorrow, but we shall certainly change the geography." - Gen. Plumer.

Commander, you will be taking part in the Allied 3rd Ypres Offensive.  The opening phases of this action include capturing the dominating heights with which the Germans have held the Ypres salient.  In preparation for this battle, 8000m of tunnels were dug under the german lines, and 21 mines were laid.  They will be detonated after the preliminary artillery barrage.

Your objectives are the resulting craters from the mines' explosions and the cities of Messines, Wytschaete, and Garaard.
