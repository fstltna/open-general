First battle of Doiran

August 9th, 1916

The last months the front has been quiet at the Greek border, but just as we feared the political situation hasn't improved at all. We should have taken our opportunity to conquer Solun when we had it. Well, never mind. Our intelligenge reports confirm that here, at the Doiran Lake, three veteran French and British divisions are preparing an offensive to break our first line of defence and invade Macedonia. You will have to hold our positions, repel the enemy troops and, finally, make a counterattack. 

Intelligence report: The enemy air force is significantly stronger than in previous battles, so be careful.

Victory conditions: Take all VHs.
