07. The enemy strikes at US II Corps - Kasserine - February 16th, 1943

German forces are following up their attack at Sidi Bou Zid with an attack on Sbeitla. You are advised to evacuate Feriana and Thelepte and reatreat to positions that can be defended better. Do not let the enemy break through to Tebessa or Thala. Such a breakthrough would destabilize the complete front.

ORDERS
Hold at least one of the victory hexes at all time. At the end of the 18 turns, hold 6 or more victory hexes for BV, 4 or 5 for V and 2 or 3 for TV.  A Loss ends the campaign.

Expect multiple Squadrons and multiple US and British battalions as reinforcements.

NOTES: 
- Units will not be automatically reinforced to strength 10 at the end of the scenario and you will not be able to acquire new units.
