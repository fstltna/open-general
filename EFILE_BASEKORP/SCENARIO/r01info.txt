01. FALCIU 2 (7 July 1941)

The war is not going as we had hoped for. North of the Pripjat Marshes the front has collapsed. However south of it, we have our front intact but are slowly being pushed back. 

For weeks the Rumanians have preparing their offensive. They will first elimenate our bridgehead over the Prut River at Falciu. Comrade, you have orders not to step back and hold your lines at all costs! If possible we will arrange reinforcements. However the burden of the Rumanian counterattack will fall upon your troops. Good luck, Comrade!
