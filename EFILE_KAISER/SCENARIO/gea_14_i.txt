Negomano. The Day of the Old Rifles

After the battle of Mahiwa, Von Lettow realized that he couldn't afford another battle like that.  This was due to the unsustainable losses of ammunition. His forces were so short of modern ammo that they had to revert to the old Model 71 rifles. These of course used rounds that produced a lot of smoke. To solve this problem Lettow decided to invade Portuguese East Africa.  Here he would capture Portuguese supply dumps.

The Portuguese, under the command of Teixeira Pinto, had established an encampment in the confluence of the Rovuma and Lujenda rivers.  Instead of fortifying his position Teixeira Pinto just waited.   He was convinced that the war was over.   Lettow had other ideas and after making a reconnaissance of the Portuguese encampment, he decided to attack. Part of his forces would cross the river upstream and attack the Portuguese in the rear while the German guns shelled the camp.
