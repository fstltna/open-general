General, Excuse me.............. Marshall! Please sit down.

Marshall, our Italy's existance will be decided within the next ten days!

The Allies have pushed us out of North Africa, and have landed all over Sicily!  Marshall Graziani is leading our counterattack to the South, you and your men have must destroy the Allied forces that are to land at Salerno.  We can not expect, and do not want help from Germany, besides, they are busy being swallowed up by Russia.

Marshall, it has not been made public, but Mussilini has been 'removed' for bringing Italy to the brink of disaster, the facist CCNN troops have are showing great loyalty to Italy as they diband and become the replacements to fill out our regular units.  

We must stop the Allies from gaining a foothold on Italy in order to get them to talk a negotiated peace.  If we can take the landing areas thus trapping the Allied troops inland, they are sure to grant our terms for peace.  You and your men have fought valliangtly for the past 5 years, but never before were you defending the shores of Italia! 

STAFF INTEL: The Allies have ground, air and sea units to repel our counter-attack, we must focus on maneuver towards objectives to be successful.
