Operation Crusader

November 18th - 1941

A lot of armoured units have been spotted in our forward positions. Surely, the enemy is trying to stop our assault on Tobruk, which is completely besiged now. Unfortunately we must halt the attack on Tobruk, to stop the British attack!. On the other hand, beware the enemy units from Tobruk, if you don't take care, they will be able to attack us from behind.

Historically, at this time the DAK was composed of the 15th Panzer Division, the 21st Panzer Division (formerly 5 Leichte Division, 5 LD) plus 6 Italian Divisions (many of them with outdated equipment). Operation Crusader was finally a stalemate, but the DAK withdrew from its positions, and on December the 24th, Benghazi fell again into the Allies hands.
