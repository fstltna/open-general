It has been a difficult battle but in the end the Soviet army has been destroyed and we have forged an alliance with Latvia that will be very important in the future.
During the rest of the winter we won't participate in any large scale military actions. But in spring we'll launch an offensive in Ukraine. If we help Symon Petliura's nationalists to create an anti-Bolshevist Ukrainian republic allied with Poland our eastern frontier will be much safer.
