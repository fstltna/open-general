In the end, God denied us the victory. The British took Addis Abeba ten days later, and Empress Zauditu surrendered. 

The British couldn't enjoy their victory for a long time. While they were occupying our country, the Germans were launching their final offensives in the Balkans and in Italy. The Italians surrendered in July, and Salonika fell soon afterwards. 

In 1919 the Germans finally breached the Entente defences in France and Belgium. Knowing that the war was lost, the British left Ethiopia in April, and we immediately took coastal Eritrea. When the Great War ended, we were counted among Germany's friends. It was a bittersweet ending. We were on the winner's side, but I'm still sorry about my defeat at Bure. I wish I had been able to win that battle. It's a thorn that will rip my flesh until the day I die.
