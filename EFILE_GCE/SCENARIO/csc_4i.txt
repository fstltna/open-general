Batalla de Belchite (Frente de Aragon)

August 24th, 1937

Atencion!, the red forces have launched another powerful strike, this time on to Zaragoza!. We must stop this attack at any costs!!!. The reds have damaged our lines Southwards to Zaragoza, along the Ebro river, and now our troops are desperately resisting at the village of Belchite. Belchite must not fall!, and the Republicans must not achieve the victory here, otherwise Zaragoza will be in a bad position to be defended...

Intelligence reports that the enemy troops consist mainly of the red V corps under the general Modesto.

Buena suerte y viva Espana!.
