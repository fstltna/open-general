Gospodin General, Florina has been secured, and your troops have marched through Seres!  The operation has been a success.  Our allies had hoped that a Russian presence on this front would persuade the Bulgarian soldiers to desert, but this has proven to be false.

During the operation the 2nd Brigade of the Russian Expedionary Corps suffered 1,400 casualties.  Although offensive operations will continue for the Russian brigades on the Salonika Front, your command is required in France, where the other two Russian Brigades have joined the French order of battle.
