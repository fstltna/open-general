BRILLIANT VICTORY

The Japenese attacked feriously, with more troops than we expected to have in total, but the Diggers from Down Under have proven themselves once again! Japan has surrendered, General! Soon all firing on Bougainville will cease as well.

On 15 August 1945 all hostilities on the island of Bougainville ceased. The Americans estimated 12,000 and the Australians 25,000 Japanese troops to be on the island when the Australian Army took over. In fact there were more than 40,000 Japanese on Bougainville. When the Japanese surrendered still 23,500 Japanese were left. During the Bougainville campaign 516 Australians were killed of died of wounds and 1,572 were wounded. The Japanese lost 8,500 in action and 9,000 died of disease or illness.
