Guderian's Gambit for Open General.
As the famous panzer commander you must race your forces to take your objectives. Encircle and wipe out the Poles then move West to destroy the French before taking on the might of the Russian Bear. 
You will engineer some of the most famous victories of all time- Brest, Sedan, Smolensk, Kiev before finally
tasting defeat at the gates of Moscow.
The original Guderian campaign has been re-engineered for Open General and makes use of many of the new and exciting features available. It includes a new Dunkirk scenario and a more realistic ending.
Enjoy :)
