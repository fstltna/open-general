"Sehr geehrte Frau Bistroff!

I've visited your husband again. Unfortunately I don't have much spare time, but I'm trying to see him at least twice per week. He's strong man and the wound is not dangerous. We all hope that he'll be in shape for a transport soon, but now it's out of question, he must stay in a hospital for another week or two. I'm sorry I can't give you better news. I understand that right now you need him the most...

Liebe Dame, let me express my sincere condolences over the loss of your beloved son. Your husband was finally strong enough to speak and he assured me that Erich didn't suffer. I understand that this won't lessen your grieve too much, but I think you need to know that.

Yours sincere Hpt. Fuchs"
