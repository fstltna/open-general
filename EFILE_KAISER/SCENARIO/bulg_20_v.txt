Again, a splendid victory. And I'm glad to inform you that the Romanians have also surrendered at the Tutrakan fortress. All of Southern Dobruzha will be free in a few days! Now you should spend some time reinforcing and regrouping your units before resuming your offensive. Your next goal will be the port city of Konstantia.
