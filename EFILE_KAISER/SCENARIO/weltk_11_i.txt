Kerenski Offensive

Jul 1st, 1917

The Russians must be crazy. After they dethroned Zar Nikolaus in March the country is in a state of anarchy. Many regiments refuse to keep on fighting and desertions are frequent. Under these circumstances Kerenski, the president of the new republican government, should have signed a peace treaty with us and then put his country in order, but he's decided to attack us instead. He thinks that France and the British Empire will grant him the help that he needs, but his allies won't give it for free. They've demanded Russia to give them some kind of military support in exchange for their future aid and, believe it or not, Kerenski has complied with those demands.

So now, at Zborow, the Russian 11th Army has been tasked with breaking through towards Zloczow. That could be a great opportunity for us. A Russian defeat would mean the failure of Kerenski and his government, and they'd be finally forced to sign a peace treaty with us in order to avoid the danger of a marxist revolution.
