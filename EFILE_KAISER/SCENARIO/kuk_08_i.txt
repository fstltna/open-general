Raid in Albania

Jan 30th, 1917

The recent death of our beloved Franz Joseph I can't make us forget that we're still fighting a war that will decide the future of the Empire. Karl I is the new Kaiser, and we must make sure that he won't be the last.

Luckily, we're still resisting the Italian attacks at the Isonzo front. To be sincere, I've already lost count of the times that they've tried to storm our positions. Nine? Ten? I can't tell. I know that we can't resist forever, though. We must send reinforcements to the Isonzo before the spring comes.

In the end, coordinating our efforts with our German, Bulgarian and Turkish allies, we managed to stop the Russian Brussilow Offensive and to defeat the Romanians, but our enemies at the Eastern front are still very strong. We can't afford retiring any divisions from there.

So, instead, the High Command has decided to launch a small winter offensive against the Italians in southern Albania. We know that, recently, they've been forced to retire two brigades from the Balkans, in order to send them to Abyssinia. Last year, Italy was imprudent enough to invade that African country, trying to avenge their defeat at Adua in 1896, but the natives overcame their colonial troops again. Now they fear an invasion of Eritrea, so they've sent some European units to Massaua. 

If we attack now, we can take advantage of the Italian weakness in Albania. We'd improve our position in the Balkans, and maybe our enemies would be forced to divert some units from the Isonzo front. That would certainly help our soldiers there.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.

Intelligenge report:
- Our scouts have informed us that there is a river ford south of the first Italian defence line.

Special note:
- This is a fictional scenario. You wouldn't want another battle at the Isonzo, would you?
