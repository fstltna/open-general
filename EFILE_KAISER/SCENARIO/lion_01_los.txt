Our troops couldn't break the Egyptian lines but, knowing that they would eventually perish if they stayed at the open, the surviving Egyptians fled to the safety of their forts. Although in the following days we tried to assault them, it was in vain. Those positions were too strong. Finally, Yohannes agreed to a ceasefire. He allowed the remaining Egyptians to leave the forts and go back to their bases and, in return, we wouldn't pursue them. After some days, Hamasien, Akele and Guzay were again under Ethiopian control, but the Egyptians still held Bogos.

Yohannes had to settle with that. He would need all his troops to end the rebellion of Ras Wolde Mikael and to force King Menelik to swear allegiance to him. It would be an easier task now that Yohanes's warriors had captured nearly 13,000 Remington rifles, 20 cannons and lots of ammunition, but in spite of that it would still take two more years to subdue all the rebel nobles.

In the meantime, Alula Engida was granted the title of Ras (you could translate it as Duke), and I became a Balambaras (a commander of elite forces). Besides, Yohannes personally convinced me to marry one of the youngest daughters of one important Imperial official, thus sealing my destiny forever. I would never return to Spain. After nearly three years, I had got used to the relative luxury of the court, and staying here for the rest of my life didn't sound that bad. Besides, have you noticed how beautiful Ethiopian women are? Well, let's just say that Yohannes offered me the hand of one of the best girls in the kingdom. It didn't take long to persuade me.

In the following years Emperor Yohannes didn't forget about Bogos, but the Egyptians refused to negotiate a peace treaty for nearly a decade. The war didn't end officially until 1884, when a new enemy emerged in Sudan, and Egypt and the British Empire had to ask Ethiopia for help.
