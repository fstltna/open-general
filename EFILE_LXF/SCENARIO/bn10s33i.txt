
BREAKOUT AT JESUP - 4 JUN 1943

Hinesville, Georgia, United States

In recent weeks we have enough forces gathered to dare the breakout from our bridgehead at Savannah. In the south at the Altamaha River the defense is obvious the weakest and a frontal attack on the strong enemy positions in the West would be too costly. Therefore our plan is to attacks south and outflank the strong defense in the west. However, your troops need to cross the Altamaha River two times to reach the enemy's rear - a maneuver that require determination and experience. Once the enemy is forced to retreat by your maneuver, chase and destroy him!

GOAL: Hold 11/9/7 VH's for a BV/V/TV and let not more then 14 enemy units reach the Exit Points!
