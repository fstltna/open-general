Liberating Ukraine

April 25th, 1920

Well, it's time to assault Kijów and hopefully inflict a decisive blow against the Red Russians. You must break the enemy line near Zytomierz and advance as fast as you can towards the east. If we can occupy Kijów within a week, the Reds might be too shocked to recover. And the Ukainians would be likely to join the forces of the Ukrainian People's Republic commanded by our ally Symon Petliura.
 
Victory conditions: Take all VHs. Keep both units alive.

Intelligence report: In the north and south, your forces will be flanked by our cavalry units. Our 4th and 13th infantry divisions are also on their way to reinforce your flanks but it will still take some time for them to join the battle. 
Be vigilant for the Russian air force! While not particularly strong, they could weaken your units if you don't support them properly.

Good luck!

Note: You have been avarded with flood of prestige. Buy a fighter or a fighter-bomber. Spend the rest of the prestige upgrading the original core units (particulary the plane).  You can buy Ukrainian units in this scenario.
