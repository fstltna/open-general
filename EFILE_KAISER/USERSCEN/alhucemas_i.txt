Disembark at Alhucemas

September 8, 1925

After the battle of Annual, the Berber rebels of the Rif region, commanded by Abd-el-Krim el Jatabbi, felt strong enough to invade the Djebala region in the western part of the Spanish protectorate in Morocco. In the beginning of 1925 they even dared to attack the Uarga Valley, in the southern French protectorate.
That last action convinced both Spain and France that it was imperative to crush Abd-el-Krim´s rebellion against the colonial powers. Both nations decided to make a coordinated assault on the Berber positions.
Thus, while the French attacked from the south, the Spanish army would disembark at the Alhucemas Bay, the very heart of the Berber lands. For the first time in History such an action would be taken with the combination of land troops and heavy air and naval support.
