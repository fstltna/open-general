THE MERSA BREGA POSITION December 1942 L

Disaster! Eight Army was succesful in surrounding and capturing the remnants of the DAK and your Ariete Battlegroup. Prepare for a long stay in captivity.

News: Our troops that landed in Tunisia to oppose the Allied invasion of Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia have been pushed back by French, US and British forces.
