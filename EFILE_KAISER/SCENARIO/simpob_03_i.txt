At the gates of Europe: Ufa

January 6th, 1919

The end of 1918 was very hard to us. At least,  Admiral Kolchak was our new Supreme Governor, and he was doing his best to win the war, but problems arose everywhere. We couldn't trust he Czechs, so most of them were retired from the front, and they were ordered to guard the Trans-Siberian Railway. It was the best possible decision, but it had a great flaw: thousands of armed foreigners were controlling our only supply line. Not surprisingly, they soon started to use the trains to secure their own evacuation, while our men in the front lacked proper equipment and reinforcements.

Most of the soldiers that sympathized with the Socialist Revolutionary Party had already deserted, or even changed sides. And, on top of all, the Bolsheviks kept on attacking us, taking one village after another.

Everything seemed to change at the end of December, when our troops defeated the Red Army in Perm. Pepelyayev and his Siberians recovered the city on December 24th, after routing the communist 3rd Army. That victory gave us hope.

But, south of Perm, the 5th Army continued its advance, and on December 31st we had to evacuate Ufa. Knowing the strategical importance of that city, a few days later Kolchak ordered us to counterattack.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.

Intelligence report:
- Some Bolshevik units have been seen trying to cross the mountains. Don't forget to protect your rear.

Special note: 
- This is a mostly fictional scenario. Actually, the White counterattack was very weak, and there never was a chance to recover Ufa until the spring.
