Liberation of Saigon

April, 1975

Commander welcome again to the front. The war with the western imperialists and their South Vietnam puppets is about to end. As you know, our latest offensives against the so-called ARVN have all ended with an overwhelming victory. The northern part of South Vietnam has been cleared of enemies by the People's Army of Vietnam. Hue and Da Nang along other key cities have been also liberated and now it's time for the heart of South Vietnam: Saigon! We need to end this war as soon as possibe since the enemies ''stratofortresses'' are smashing Hanoi killing many woman and children.

As a reward for your past victories Hanoi wants to give you the opportunity to become the liberator of Saigon. The goal of central command is to make a fast advance on Saigon and continue to surprise the world with our lightning victorys over the enemy.  Maybe we can even trap the Americans on the roof of their embassy.

For Hanoi a Tactical Victory will be unacceptable. To help you in your advance some additional divisions have infiltrated into the South.
