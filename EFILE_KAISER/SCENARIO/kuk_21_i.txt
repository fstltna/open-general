Jerusalem

Oct 31st, 1918

After leaving Syria, Allenby has retreated with his remaining divisions into the fortified area of Jerusalem, where he hopes to stop our offensive. 

You can't let that happen. Conquering the old capital of King David would have a huge impact on the morale of our army, and would allow us to control all the valley of the Jordan. The Turks have been able to reorganize their troops since their defeat at Megiddo, so this time they'll be able to give you some support. However, don't be overconfident. The British are still a formidable enemy. Get ready, General, and good luck!

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.

Special note: 
- You can buy Ottoman equipment in this scenario.
