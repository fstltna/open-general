General,

The General Staff is satisfied with your manoeuvre. You have protected the retreat of the "17 Division d'Infanterie" but the Germans have not stopped and are already putting pressure on our new positions. You must quickly join the rest of the Army for continuing the battle.

Le Chef d'Etat-major général de l’armée (EMGA).

Historical note:

On the night of the 18th/19th of May the retreat of the Belgian Army to its new positions behind the Gent-Terneuzen Canal was protected by the cavalry divisions and the 1st "Chausseurs Ardennaises"/"Ardense Jager" division. When the Germans crossed the Escaut/Scheldt River by using a tunnel not completely destroyed in the Antwerpen/Anvers region fierce battles occurred around Zwijndrecht between the German 208th infantry division and units of the Belgian cavalry. The German infantry was not able to advance further due to the attacks performed by Belgian tanks and AFV's (T13). At the end of the day the Belgian units retreated as ordered behind the Gent-Terneuzen Canal.
