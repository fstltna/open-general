Kindralmajor,

Your defeat at Pskov is a disappointment.  Your troops were saved from disaster by the arrival of Yudenich's further reinforcements.  Despite this serious setback, General Yudenich has announced his goals for a most ambitious operation:  the capture of Petrograd.

Headquarters has yet to determine your role in these operations.  In the meanwhile, your troops are transferred back to Estonia for further training.
