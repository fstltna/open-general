You've got to know when to walk away: farewell to Ufa

May 29th, 1919

The situation was chaotic. The Red Army was approaching from three different sides and nothing seemed to be able to stop them. Rumours indicated that part of the Turkestan Army had crossed the river Belaya north of Ufa. If that was true, the Bolsheviks could cut our only retreat line in just a few days.

The civilians, and many of our soldiers, were on the verge of panic. Nobody thought about the Spring Offensive any more. The defeat of the Red Army, the liberation of Moscow... all of those ideas appeared like distant dreams, like something unreal that we had imagined decades ago. The present was completely different, far worse than anything that we could have imagined. Having thought about victory seemed foolish. There and then, survival was the only thing that mattered.

And, despite all our problems and all our fears, we had to persist. We had to delay the Bolsheviks for as long as we could. If they wasted enough time, we could evacuate the civilians, the wounded, our equipment, and most of our troops. We could make an orderly retreat and, beyond the Urals, we would have more chances to stop the red wave.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.
