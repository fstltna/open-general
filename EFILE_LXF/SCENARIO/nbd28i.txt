Commander, the war in Europe is almost over. The last chance for the Germans to pull out a victory lies with their new advanced weaponry.  We have a chance now to put a stop to some of that weapons development. We want you to launch a quick strike aimed at destroying the famous Krupp Armaments factories at Essen. You can expect to be greeted by some exotic weaponry plus everything the Krauts can throw at you.

To win the scenario you must destroy the two factories.
