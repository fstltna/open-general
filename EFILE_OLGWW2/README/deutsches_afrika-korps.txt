*** Deutsches Afrika-Korps Open General Version ***
By Santiago Fuertes & Pablo Schlegel - LG 2011 - http://gilestiel.nerim.net/lg/

*** BACKGROUND.

Congratulations for your designation as new commander in chief of our expeditionary forces in Africa. Your mission is to aid our Italian partners in their fight against the British, after a bad year of defeats for our allies in Africa.

The Italians have lost most of their territories in Africa, and we cannot allow the British to get complete control of this continent, otherwise, the Mediterranean Sea would be completely under enemy management.

OKH knows that you will be able to stop the enemy, and defeat his plans. For this purpose, we will put under your command the 15th Panzer Division, and the 5th Leichte Division, however, depending on your success, more reinforcements would be sent to you.

As soon as you arrive in Africa, you will feel that the environment is completely different from the Polish or French soil, where you have undertaken actions until now. The terrain there, is desertical, with extremely hot days, and icy nights. The roads are mainly sand stripes made by the wheels of the trucks, drawn between the dunes. The fuel and the water are precious goods, and basically the life is hard in the deserts of North Africa. 

In the other hand, the enemy forces consist mainly of elements from the 8th British Army. Some of the enemy units are the finest of all the British Armies, like the 7th Armoured Division (Desert Rats). The British surely will outnumber our units, but our equipment is better, at least we think that.
