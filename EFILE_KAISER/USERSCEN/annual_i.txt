Defence of Annual

July 16, 1921

In 1921, after thirteen long years, the war that Spain was fighting in northeastern Morocco seemed close to an end. The Spanish army had launched a major offensive in order to subjugate the last hostile Berber tribes in the Rif region. 

But the Berbers from the Rif din´t want to live under the rule of the Spanish protectorate. Lead by the Cadi, Abd el-Krim al Jatabbi, a former employee of the colonial administration in the Office of Indigenous Affairs in Melilla who had been educated in Spain, and leader of the Beni Urriaguel tribe.
Abd el-Krim declared jihad against the Spanish invaders, and in June the spanish offensive halted when the Berbers retook the position at Abarrán. 

From his HQ at Annual, spanish general Manuel Fernández Silvestre saw how the number of enemies grew day by day. On July 16th it was clear that a huge Berber counteroffensive was inminent. Could Silvestre´s troops, unexperienced and demoralized, defend their positions in the mountains of the Rif?
