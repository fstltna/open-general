Halen: Battle of the Silver Helmets  

August 12, 1914

With Liege in German hands, the German 1st and 2nd Armies are pouring into Belgium to defeat the Belgian army and to move onto Paris. The Belgian 4th infantry division is defending Namur while the other 5 infantry divisions - including the 3rd that got hit hard at Liege - have taken position behind the river Gete. Their northern flank is covered by the 1st Cavalry Division of General de Witte. 
The German 2nd and 4th Kavalerie divisions have gotten the task to cross the Gete at Halen - defended by the Belgian cavalry division - and move to Diest via Zelk. If this plan succeeds, the Belgian army will be forced to retreat to avoid getting encircled.
