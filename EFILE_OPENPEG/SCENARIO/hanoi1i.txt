Hanoi, Vietnam

With the People’s Republic of China reeling from the bloody nose they received at Ho Chi Minh City, our forces are poised to deliver a knock-out blow. After a fiercely contested landing, Hai Phong surrendered. The Chinese, though, are dug in deeply at Hanoi and you will need more than a few well-aimed strikes to dislodge them. Take your forces, drive across the Red River to seize Hanoi, and eliminate any vestige of Chinese presence in the region.
