Welcome to the old lands of Mesopotamia, Marshall! For the last months we have engaged the British and later on other Allied forces too here along the Tigris river. Each time there was a stalemate and when we finally assembled enough forces to storm the Allies, they were gone: to the south to erect new lines of defence. Mosul, Tikrit, Bagdad were like it. The Allies have erected lines of defence in the Kut vicinity. They must hold if not they will be driven into the sea at Basra or into the huge swamps! We have got help of Germany. They sent airwings and their 2nd SS "Das Reich" Division after refitting in France and fighting in Russia. Combined with our forces and your men, we will defeat the enemy decisively! This force is all under your command. Not all units have reached the Kut vicinity but you have orders to attack right on. Reinforcements will arrive within days. You must take Kut, and the roads south and north of the Tigris river as well as the road leading south through the swamps. The British, Indians, Americans, and Polish, have and are assembling their troops to hold our thrust and to save guard their oil. Make sure they do not succeed. We and Germany need that oil and besides that the war for Turkey will be won! Good luck, Marshall. We count on you this time again.
