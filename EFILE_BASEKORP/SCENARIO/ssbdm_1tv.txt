The 'Frau's proved their Fuhress right and the Yugoslavian forces were destroyed with aid of the Brits and French.Now instead of Stalin having feet in Checkoslavakia it was the SS and they were there to stay,the "destruction of the Czech Army demanded It and the Sudetenland had to be protected" the Fuhress told England and France.Two Brits conversation after the battle. "Blimey Horace,did You see those girls take out that machine-gun.Hey give me another smoke will Ya? I would have never rushed a position like that.Hard to believe only 4 or 5 of them got hit"." Yeh Perky,they should have waited for that tank to arrive but when that Commander said Go those Krazy Girls acted as if someone had set a fire underneath their bumms.One thing is for sure once they got within distance to toss those stick grenades that was all She wrote.And that injured Guy begging for His life,what did that Broad shout before She cut His throat"?"It was something about not being 'SS/B/Fem/Im' I think,did You see that look on Her face while doing It,Evil I tell You Horace as if She enjoyed the sight of Blood.And afterwards them Girls talking about stuff as cooking and marrying and having a slew of kids as if nothing here had ever happened.I have heard of the Devil but always took that stuff to be a lot of rubbish by the clergy but these 'Fraus in those SS helmets may prove Me wrong"."Hey Perky You know something, we're not SS/B/Fem/Im".
