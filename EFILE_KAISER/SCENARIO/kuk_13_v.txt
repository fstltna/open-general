Thank you, General, you have saved us from a potential disaster. We'll make a strategic retreat to avoid being encircled, but that's not important. We've already got what we needed: the Russian offensive has lost momentum. When our reinforcements arrive, we'll be able to stop our enemies, and we'll recover our initial positions. The Russian offensive won't succeed.

However, it's quite obvious that if we keep on fighting in several fronts, we'll be doomed. Due to the Russian attacks, we've been forced to cancel our offensive against the treacherous Italians in the Alpen. Yes, we may have defeated Serbia, but that's not enough. And now things can get even worse. It seems that the Romanians, encouraged by the Russian offensive, are about to declare war on the Empire. Soon, we'll have a new enemy.
