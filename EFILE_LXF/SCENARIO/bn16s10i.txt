West off Shetland Islands, Scotland

Commander in Chief, Atlantic Fleet informs
After the heavy losses for the Royal Navy in recent months, we were able to establish a supply blockade of the British Isles. Since then, the Grand Fleet has been stuck in Scapa Flow.
But one hour ago was reported that significant enemy forces in Scapa Flow have set sail in north-northeast direction. We will try to intercept the enemy at the height of the Shetlands - may be the British want to face a decisive battle.

The following enemy main units were reported:

- 6 battleships
- 9 cruisers
- 1 aircraft carrier
