
OMSK - 14 OCT 1942

Southwest of Omsk, Siberia

We are very close to establish the land bridge to our eastern allies! The Japanese move with incredible speed - Kalachinsk, just 90 kilometers east of Omsk, has fallen into their hands. Start immediately your attack at Omsk before the Japanese arrive! In Omsk the Russians have pulled together their remaining eastern elite units for a last stand. Air force and armored units are as good as gone and their remaining tanks were entrenched because of fuel shortages. Expect strong resistance - the NKVD will ensure that no troops will surrender!

GOAL: Take all VH's!

Main reinforcements (AI-controlled):
2-5th turn - east, Japanese 12th Infantry-Division
5th turn - east, Japanese 1st Tank-Brigade 
6-7th turn - east, Japanese 9th Infantry-Division
