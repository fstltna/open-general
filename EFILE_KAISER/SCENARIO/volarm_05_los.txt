Finally, after so many months of endless fighting, we've expelled the Communists from the Kuban. Although I must confess that I wouldn't have been able to take Stavropol without Wrangel's timely help.

The remnants of the 11th Army have escaped to the Terek, but their defeat has been so absolute that I doubt they'll recover from it. Surely they'll merge with the 12th Army, that is currently dealing with a cossack rebellion against the Reds. Soon they'll have to deal with us, too. The Terek is our next objective.
