Comrade General, you have broken the Red Army's image of near-invincibility.  The British and their European allies have driven us from the coast of England, and we may never have a chance like that again.  Comrade Stalin is thinking of using nuclear weapons to finish off the troublesome British.  Of course, you will not be around to see any of this.  You, Comrade, are scheduled to report to the barracks in twenty minutes, and after that I imagine the gallows.
