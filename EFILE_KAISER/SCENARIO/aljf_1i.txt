20. 4. 1848, Der Heckerzug (Hecker's Uprising)

Lieber Freund,

...I feel, now the time has come !
I've joined the "Heckerzug" and fight for a free, democratic Republic for all Germans.....

To hell with all those Dukes and Earls !
To hell with all Prussians !
Vivat the german Republic !

ORDERS:
Herr General, free all the Main Cities around the Neckar and take you radvance to the important City of Freiburg. 
Reinforces from every liberated City will join our Revolution Army and the german democratic Legion aproaching in the South.
Hurry up! Our Spies report enemy forces, arriving in the east in a few days.
The Capital of Baden, Karlsruhe, we must take later.

TAKE ALL VH's

ADVICE FROM YOUR OLDEST SERGEANT:
Herr General, we must hurry up: speed is the key; but dont forget our back.....
And before you attack Freiburg, you must gather your troops !

NOTE:
It is only possible to deploy Friedrich Hecker at hex (29,29).
