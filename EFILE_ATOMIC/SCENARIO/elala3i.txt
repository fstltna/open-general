SITUATION:

We now have an airfield close to Alexandria. That will help our advance on the city. But be aware that the British army and their allies still have a large number of troops in this area.

ORDERS: 

Take all VHs in 22/26/32 turns for a BV/V/TV.

NOTES:

Please note that the Aussault Engineer unit of the Folgore Division is able to bridge in this scenario.

The Regia Marina will assist you in this scenario. The British have some powerful battleships anchored in the ports of Alexandria and at sea.

You may buy some strength points or attachments for your two core units now.

Your army fields two supply/healer units in this scenario as well as a staionary hospital tent. Use them to heal and supply your adjacent units.
