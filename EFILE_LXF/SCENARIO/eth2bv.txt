BRILLANT VICTORY

The Ethiopians were demoralized and disorganized, and the Somalis were ready to take part in what was from their point of view another round, Italian-officered, of the centuries-old struggle against the Christians of Ethiopia.

There was a sudden and unexpected visit by the Emperor in person. On 11 November he flew down to Jijiga and drove out at dawn to the picturesque town of Dagghabur, a town of a few thousand inhabitants that lies flat in the heart of the desert on the Tug Jerrer, dominated by its white mosque, the most important in the Ogaden.

There he distributed rewards and punishments. Thus, having in his own fashion steadied the morale of his troops in the Ogaden, Haile Selassie flew back to his capital to consider his next move.
