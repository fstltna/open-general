BRILLIANT VICTORY

Brilliant, comrade. You have taken Kerch and repulsed all fascist counterattacks! The landing near Feodosiya has been an equal success. The enemy was quick enough to retreat and build a new defensive line, but we are in possession of the Kerch peninsula from Kerch to Feodisya and have drained away enemy forces that could otherwise attack Sevastopol.
