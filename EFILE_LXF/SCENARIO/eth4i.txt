BATTLE OF GANALE DORIA

January 6th, 1936 (Juba Region, Sidamo and Bale Provinces, Southern Ethiopia)

The Ethiopian counter-attack.

It was in the southern half of his sector that Graziani realized that he would have to meet a threat. The forces of Bale led by Dejaz Beiene Merid were moving down the Webbi Shebelli River. More dangerous still, the forces of Ras Desta were assembling in Sidamo to move down the Juba River and turn Graziani's left flank.

By November the Sidamo army, at least 20,000 strong, had reached Magallo, north of Neghelli. It was a well-armed and well-equipped force, so well-armed indeed that the Italians were convinced that Ras Desta had been receiving rifles from the British in Kenya. It was moreover working in close co-operation with the forces of Bale, the adjoining province to the north.

It looked to Graziani like a well coordinated movement, particularly difficult to counter because Ras Desta's right flank was protected by the Kenya border. It would become particularly threatening if it was combined with an offensive in the Ogaden.

Fortunately for Graziani's peace of mind Ras Desta's advance through the almost trackless forests and mountains of Southern Sidamo was slow.

By 6 January Ras Desta's forces HAMMERED CONTINUALLY BY THE ITALIAN BOMBERS as they advanced up the palm-shaded valley, were in a semicircle about sixty miles from Dolo.
