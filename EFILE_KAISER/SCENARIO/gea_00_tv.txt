Historic aftermath: After a hard fight, the Germans stopped the British attack and forced them to reembark, leaving more than 800 casualties, against about 50 dead on the German side. Also many war supplies were abandoned, among them enough English rifles to equip three Askari companies, 600.000 rounds and 16 machine guns.
