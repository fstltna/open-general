The assault of Kiev started on 5th November 1943, with the 1st Czechoslovak Independent Brigade leading the attack. Soviet artillery support was immense and the German positions couldn't withstand it.

Czechoslovaks entered Kiev from northwest and fought through the city, killing some six hundred enemy soldiers. Finally they reached and saved the bridges across Dnyepr.

Sources claim that brigade knocked out many German bunkers and machine guns, destroyed several vehicles, including two Ferdinands. Czechoslovaks even shot down an airplane.
