Fighting in Kafkasya: Arhavi- Findikli - Brilliant Victory

The victory was amazing!

Historical outcome
Unfortunately, the Russians attacked earlier than expected, and Erzurum was lost on February 16. The Turkish 3rd Army fielded 140,000 men. Half of them were killed or wounded. Very few became the prisoners of war. The Russian Caucasus Army fielded 280,000 men, and its losses were much lighter. 
The Ottoman forces had to withdraw to the west, not only from Erzurum, but also from the seaside regions. The situation was dire, but the V corps finally arrived, and the 3rd Army's leader gen. Mahmut Kamil was replaced with Vehip Pasha.

If the Russians from Kafkasya joined the British forces in Mesopotamia, the Ottoman Empire would be doomed.
