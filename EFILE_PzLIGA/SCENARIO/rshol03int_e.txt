Capture of Bogor

March, 1942

The Dutch have resisted in this jungle area since January General.  Bogor and other nearby places are the last bases which the enemy still holds on this island. Your command will be split in two groups; your task is to clear the jungle of enemy elements and to seize all other objectives.  Select carefully the jungle paths for your troops.  I think the jungle will be our worst enemy here.
