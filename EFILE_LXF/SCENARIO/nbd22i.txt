Our next target is the Japanese airstrips and port facilities at Hollandia. Intelligence estimates place only one Japanese division guarding the area.  MacArthur wants to strike now, before the Japanese can strengthen the garrison.  It is imperative that you move as swiftly as possible to prevent any reinforcement from Rabaul. Aerial recon has spotted lots of Japanese shipping in Rabaul over the last week and it is suspected that the Tokyo Express may try to run reinforcements in by destroyer. 

Tactical command has been given to you in this mission. You must decide on the proper strategy to best get your troops ashore and to take the objectives in as short a time possible. There are enemy fleet units in the area and we can not bring in your air support until you have captured an airfield in the area.
