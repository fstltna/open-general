Good evening!

Your swift and decisive attack completely destroyed both Soviet divisions; all of Finland is celebrating the great victory!

Now let my Finnish troops show you some much deserved hospitality, the Russians will not return again this winter and rumor has it that Stalin is looking to talk!

Now sir, warm yourself by the fire and let us discuss my plans for a spring offensive, should I get the chance, I am most interested in your critique........
