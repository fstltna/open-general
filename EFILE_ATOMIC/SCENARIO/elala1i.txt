SITUATION:

The British overestimated their capabilities. They clashed against our defensive lines but our men stood their ground. Now it is time to launch an counterattack on the whole front. El Alamain will be our stepping stone to Alexandria. Our army lost some strength points in the recent battle, but the British got hit badly. Hurry up now, start the enginees!

ORDERS: 

Repell the last attacks and launch your counterattack. Take all VHs in 11/13/16 turns for a BV/V/TV.

NOTES:

You may buy some strength points or attachments for your two core units now.

Your army fields two supply/healer units in this scenario as well as a stationary hospital tent. Use them to heal and supply your adjacent units.
