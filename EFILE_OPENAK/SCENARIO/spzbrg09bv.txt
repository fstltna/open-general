"So was passiert? Kommen... Endlich! Gib mir General Otto Bistroff!

Hello Otto! How are you? Listen, kamerad, I've got a big news for you! Come and join me tonight in the Offizie... what? Why, what's happening? Oh, it's today? Nevermind, even better than that, we'll talk about it after dinner. At least we'll speak at rest and without too many ears listening... No, no... everything's fine. I'm glad that I have called, otherwise I'd forget about Pauline. I'm going to a florist's right away. Should I buy roses, carnations, or... Pardon? No, it's not the reason why I phoned. Otto, the machine is somehow noisy, seems like they're repairing the line, if you understand me. We'll talk later. If I hadn't forgotten about the annual party, I wouldn't have phoned at all. See you in the evening! Bye now... Ja, ja... Ja, tschuss!"
