Strike on Kontum

November, 1967

Comrade commander, we again need your men. As you know, our mid year operations in the province of Kontum have gone well, nevertheless there are still several enemy forward bases that we must destroy. Those bases are too close to our supply routes for Ho the Chi Minh trail and our area 609.  For this reason they must be destroyed. In addition in the province of Kontum an enemy offensive is anticipated and our enemies do not have to count on those outposts.

Victory Conditions:

- Hold 5 victory objectives until the end to achieve a Brilliant Victory.
- Hold 4 victory objective until the end to achieve a Victory.
- Hold 3 victory objective until the end to achieve a Tactical Victory.
