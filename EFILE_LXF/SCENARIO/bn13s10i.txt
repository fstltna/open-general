
ARRAS - 21 MAY 1940

Yesterday the German Panzers have reached the Channel. We are cut off from our Armies in the south. But the corridor between them and us is neither wide or strong. We will conduct an counterattack south and regain contact.

Lord Gort, commander of the BEF, has committed forces to help us attack south. These British troops are known as Frankforce. They will capture Arras and push further south while we will attack on their right and assist them. We are facing at least two German Panzer Divisions. But we must succeed. If we do not we will be stuck in the north! Vive la France!

GOAL: Take all necessary VH's! Check out which VH's need to be captured and which can't be lost!
