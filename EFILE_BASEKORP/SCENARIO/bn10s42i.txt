
SABLE ISLAND - 9 MAR 1944

St.John's, Newfoundland

In the last year we have occupied the small Sable Island situated 300 km southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia and build up there a weather and radar station as well as a Naval Air Base and an airstrip for emergency landings. Since then, the base has become an important source of information. Recently, increased enemy activity were registered, which indicate that the enemy plans to attack and destroy this base. We want to deploy some additional forces on the island and increase our air force on Newfoundland to be prepared for an enemy attack. Arrange all necessary things!

Order reinforcement troops for Sable Island (3 units) and your air force to St.John's, Newfoundland and keep yourself ready! 

GOAL: Take all VH's!

NOTE: Bomb no infrastructure, that you may need later!
