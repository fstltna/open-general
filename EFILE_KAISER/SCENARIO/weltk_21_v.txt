Dieppe is in our hands and you've taken thousands of British prisoners. However, despite your victory, that stubborn country still refuses to surrender. Do you understand it? They've been expelled out of France, but they still want to fight! They want to keep their naval blockade on our coast, while they hope for an American intervention. What else do we have to do before they acknowledge their defeat?

Well, we'll deal with that problem later. Right now it's time for us to give the final blow to France.
