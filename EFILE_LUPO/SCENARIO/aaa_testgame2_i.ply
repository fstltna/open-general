Industrial Center
September 1st 1984

The Americans managed to land an invasion force right before a vital soviet industrial city. This action came at very high cost with the lost of the carrier group leaving the amphibious force without air cover but soviet forces could only deploy a reserve division with antiquated equipment as stopgap measure.
The Americans must absolutely remove the factories before the Soviets deploy advanced units to the region.

Destroying all factories or capturing key locations will immediately end the scenario in favour of the USA.
This is a DEMO game to let the player familiarize with the air assault concept.

PBEM version: turn 1 is meant for deployment only.
