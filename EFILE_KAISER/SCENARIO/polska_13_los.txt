Everything is lost. Our army has been destroyed and the Russians have conquered our beloved capital. We can offer no further resistance and we have no other option but surrender. Poland will become a dominion of Soviet Russia. Or at best, if we are lucky and the League of Nations puts pressure on Russia, we'll be allowed to keep a tiny Polish state around Kraków.

In any case, going into exile would be the best thing for you to do General. After this defeat you will be better off in Paris or London than in Poland.
