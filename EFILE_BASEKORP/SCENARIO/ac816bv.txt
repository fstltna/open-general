Come in General......Incredible.....Inconceivable!

This cold winter will not quit......but this did not stop you!

However, We have been called to direct our attacks back, our flanks have collapsed!.....The Russians don't know it yet, but they have cut us off.

We must re-establish contact with our right and left quickly!  Go quickly, tell your men their bravado is remarkable and my gratitude has no end, Italia has a picture of everyone of them in the Rome catherdral, praying for their safety amid this winter! 

God help us all......
