Perfect! From Toulon we'll be able to take most of southern France. Our enemies aren't used to fighting on two fronts. We had to do it for a long time, while they laughed at our army, believing that we were useless bufoons. Well, now they'll know how difficult it is. Do you think they'll be able to manage the situation? I don't. I'm sure that, in a few weeks, France will surrender and the war will be finally over.
