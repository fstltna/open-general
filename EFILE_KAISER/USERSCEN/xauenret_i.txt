Retreat from Xauen

November 15, 1924

After the battle of Annual the political turmoil in Spain became so huge that King Alfonso XIII autorized the suspension of the parliamentary system and the dictatorship of General Primo de Rivera.
The new dictator´s priority was the end of the war of Morocco, but that was not going to be an easy task. The cabilas saw Abd el-Krim as their saviour and liberator, and the number of insurgents grew day by day.
The Spanish garrisons, poorly equipped and scattered all over the Protectorate were in extreme danger, since a general Berber attack would make them fall one by one, causing a massacre. The danger was specially critical in the western part of the Protectorate.
Thus, in 1924 Primo de Rivera decided to retreat all of the Spanish garrisons on the western zone to strong defensive lines near the main towns: Ceuta, Larache and Tetuán. The last step of the operation, and the most dangerous one, would be  the retreat from Xauen to Tetuán.

Victory conditions: You must retreat a total of 25 Spanish units.
Beware: If the enemy takes Dar Accoba on the 7 first turns, you will lose.
