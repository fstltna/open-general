"Hello Otto. I can't tell that I'm glad to see you. So, once again... that request of yours. Hmm... Hmm...

Well, what can I do? All that I could say I've already said. Tank school desperately needs experts of your kind. Many men would pay dearly to get out of the meatgrinder and for the possibility that you've got. Moreover, your health is not perfect and it won't be any time soon. Still, if you wish to return to lead the brigade, I won't be the one who's stopping you. But let me tell you just few last words.

Pauline needs you more than ever before. Think of her. At least for a while.

And one last note. I know what drives you into battle. It has nothing to do with brigade or with the whole war. Well, it's your decision. Again. But know this - you won't bring Erich back from the dead...

I'll sign the papers in the evening. If you change your mind before then... just let me know."


Victory condition: Capture all VHs.

Overall info: (Somewhere in USSR.) After weeks of heavy fighting, the Germans penetrate deeper and deeper to the East, but the flow of fresh enemy units seems to be endless and once again, the Russians have stopped the brigade.
The enemy holds a firm defense line along the river line. Although the Soviets are badly trained and lead, although their morale is low, their equipment is a quality one. More and more of their excellent tanks show up every day. Here they concentrated some fifty of them, including the fearsome T-34s and KVs. This will be the first time our brigade encounters them. Thankfully we know how to fight them and in previous weeks we were lucky enough to acquire nine new eighty-eights. Still: don't underestimate the Russians, especially because their airbases are very close and they can support their ground units. Our pilots need to refuel and rearm their machines and they'll be back no sooner than in few hours. Until then... hold on.
