Good evening, Herr General.
As you are aware, the Allied forces have been destroyed in their attempt to invade "Fortress Europe".
High Command has decided now is the time to defeat England. You and your elite troops have been chosen to lead the invasion of the British Isles.
The Royal Navy is weak but not destroyed so we must move across the channel rapidly.

We are giving you the use of our latest "terror" weapons, the V2 rockets. The British are desperate and will offer extremely defensive tactics.
You must gain the German Army a foothold on English soil!
Good luck, General.
