3rd Ypres - Battle of Pilkem - July 31, 1917

The front line here at Ypres has not changed much in the last 2 years. But that could change.

After the attack at Messines - South of Ypres - six weeks ago, British forces are switching their attention to the sector North and East of Ypres. Your task is to counter all attacks and push the Brits back to their starting positions. Unfortunately 4th Army has positioned your (core) Eingreif divisions quite far from the front line. This keeps them safe from enemy artillery fire, but it also means that they cannot counterattack as quickly as you might like.

Player orders: Capture all victory hexes to win the scenario. Faster, more mobile troops might increase your change for a Brilliant Victory.
