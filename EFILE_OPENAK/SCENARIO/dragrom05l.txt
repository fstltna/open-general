
   T-3 medium tank.

    On 17 October 1942, awared by the poor condition of their allies facing an increasing power of the Soviet armoured force, Germany agreed to deliver twenty-two of their medium-type tanks to the Romanian Army. These included eleven Panzerkampfwagen III Ausf N, the final version of the Pzkpfw III series, produced by Daimler-Benz during 1942-43.
 
    The Pzkpfw III N was of little value against heavy armoured targets, nevertheless it was far more better armoured and armed than the obsolete R-2 tank that equipped the Romanian Armoured Division by the time. The eleven Pzkpfw III tanks, designated by Romanians "T-3" (T being the acronim of Tank in Romanian), formed up a medium tank company in the 1st Tank Regiment.
