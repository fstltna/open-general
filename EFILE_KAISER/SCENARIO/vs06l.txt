The Affair at Nery - September 1914 - L

Disaster. Your brigades had to flee into the woods and your division has ceased to be an effective fighting force.   

Historical outcome September 1st
- 4:30 1st Cavalry Brigade and L battery at Nery, who are bivouacking between the widely separated 4th and 5th Divisions is ordered to resume their march, but zero visibility because of fog made this impossible.
- 5:30 A 11th Hussars patrol runs into units from the 4th Kavallerie Division. The German artillery starts shelling and machine gunning Nery.
- 7:00 The BEF's 4th Cavalry Brigade with I battery came to the rescue of the 1st Brigade. Soon after that the first units of the 10th Brigade/4th Division and the 19th independent Brigade arrived on the scene as well.
- 8:00 I battery silenced the German artillery and the German 4th Kavallerie Division began to draw off, leaving all artillery behind. Its three Brigades got separated, each of them hiding in the woods around Nery for the rest of the day. 
It took several more days before the division was combat ready again. And even then - contrary to the 2nd and 9th Kavallerie Divisions in the Korps - it was kept away from the front line.
The BEF's L Battery won 3 VCs that morning but had to be sent back to England for rebuilding.
