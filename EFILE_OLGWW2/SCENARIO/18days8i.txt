The Campaign of the 18 Days
(10-28 May 1940)

General,

It seems the Germans have reached the North Sea at Abbeville cutting the Allied armies in two. We are now isolated from our supply lines. The battle of the North has started.

The Belgian Army has taken positions on the Terneuzen canal, Gent/Gand bridgehead and the Escaut/Scheldt River. Most of our divisions are under strength and have already lost 1/3 of their material after ten days of continuous fight and several retreats. Some units are close to collapse but the Army in general can still fight.

The "Corps de Cavalerie" has to protect the north flank of the deployment replacing the French troops which are moving back to France. 

The German 18th Army is tempting to cross our lines in several places. Your mission is to hold the line and avoid the Germans creating any bridgehead. 

Le Chef d'Etat-major général de l’armée (EMGA)

Warning: some units may collapse and stop fighting.

Victory conditions: to hold 4 VH for a BV, 3 VH for a V and 2 VH for a TV.
