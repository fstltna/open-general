The First World War - Sarrebourg - 19th, Aug. 1914

Ma chère Fabienne,

I hope that, when you returned home after visiting Denise and saw that I wasn't at home, you didn't worry too much. I wish I could have written a real farewell letter, and not the quick note that I had to leave for you, but the orders from the QG were clear: I had to go back to active duty immediately, in a matter of hours, in fact. The war with Germany is so important for our army, that everything else had to be put aside. I'm so sorry for you, but there was nothing that I could do about that.

I never thought that they'd think about me for an active position in the first line of battle. Too old for that, I said. But some of my comrades, that are currently in the Ministry, think otherwise. They believe that, right now, we need level headed commanders, whose wishes for revenge don't cloud their judgements.

Of course, we both know that if I happen to be less obsessed with vengeance than other veterans of the war against Prussia, it's just because we first met, and we were engaged, during the siege of Belfort. So, despite the humiliation of the defeat, I can't help but remember that time as one of the happiest in my life.

For security reasons, I can't tell you exactly where I am. I've been given the command of a division somewhere in Lorraine, and I guess that soon we'll attack the German positions.  Although, given my experience, I doubt that the'll just stay there waiting for us.
 
Remember me in your prayers. I'll visit you at home as soon as I can. Je t'embrasse,

Jean-Babtiste.
