Failed Uprising

August 4th, 1914

The Kingdom of Poland was occupied by Russians for more than half a century. Polish citizens of Austro-Hungary could develop their own organizations, including paramilitary organizations. In 1908 a refugee from the "Russian" part of Poland, Józef Pi³sudski, took control over these paramilitary organizations and prepared these people to fight against the Russian Empire in the coming war. But war didn't break out in 1908 when Austria annexed Bosnia-Herzegowina. War also did not break out in 1911 when Germany tried to take over Morocco. Finally the Great War began in 1914.

In order to attempt the start of the anti-Russian uprising in Poland, we need to cross the border and take the city of Kielce. 

Victory conditions: Liberate Kielce. Take all VHs. Core unit MUST survive.

Intelligence report: Only light cossack units have been spotted. Our resources are limited, so there will be no additional funds. Volunteers can approach from the south and there is plenty of ammo.

Good Luck!
