Message from General Marina Vega's HQ:

Good work, General. You have wiped out the rebel "kabilas" (local tribes) that menaced Melilla. The Spanish flag is waving on the top of Mount Gurugú and soon we´ll be able to expand our area of influence in the region. 

However the price has been high. We have lost many brave Spanish soldiers, including General Pintos. We can't afford such heavy casualties, or else our beloved fatherland could suffer another anarchist uprising like the recent one in Barcelona. From now on you will have to command your troops more carefully.
