You were defeated. The portuguese camp hasn't been taken in time and we are critically short of all kind of supplies. We must surrender, as we don't have the resources to continue the war.


Historical aftermath: The portuguese army was completetly defeated.  They suffered more than 200 casualties and about 700 prisioners. Teixeira Pinto and part of his staff were killed early in the battle. Even after firing more than 30,000 rounds, they only inflicted 1 german and a few askaris dead. Lettow captured a huge quantity of ammunition and enough portuguese rifles to arm his troops.  Now they could discard the old ones. The german Askaris shouted "This is the day of the old rifles!", refering to their victory with older weapons.
