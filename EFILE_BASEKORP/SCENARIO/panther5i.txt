Strachwitz's Offensive (26 Mar 1944)
Second part of the "Defending The Reich" minicampaign.

STRATEGIC SITUATION:
Since the early weeks of this year, fierce battle is fought for Narva and in the town's surroundings. Soviets built several bridgeheads and they threaten to cut communications towards Tallin. They must not break through the Narva Isthmus, because this could mean a loss of Estonia and subsequent isolation of Finland.

TACTICAL ORDERS:
Your battalion, recently refitted with many new Panthers, was chosen for the upcoming attack against Narva bridgeheads. Commanded by Hyacinth Graf Strachwitz, our group must break through the firmly held lines of the Soviet 109th Rifle Corps, capture the enemy HQ, and hold it long enough for the main forces of the 170th, 11th, and 227th Infantry Divisions to follow in your tracks and entrench themselves.

RECONNAISSANCE:
Movement is hindered in this swampy area interwoven with rivers, and all bridges and major roads are heavily guarded with anti-tank cannons, MGs, and field artillery. The enemy forces are mostly static, and the Soviets lack armoured units. Unfortunately they are achieving strategical air superiority, and Luftwaffe is so much depleted that the Soviet long-range airplanes can attack nearly unopposed both directly on frontline and deep in our rear.

NOTE:
You really need to address the growing Soviet dominance in the air.

VICTORY CONDITIONS:
At the end of the 16th turn hold the required number of Victory Hexes to claim the corresponding victory.
