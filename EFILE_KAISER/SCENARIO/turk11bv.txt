Kut al Amara - Brilliant Victory

Congratulations! You have taken Kut,  almost 10,000 prisioners, caused more than 20,000 casualties, forced the Anglo-Indian troops to retreat to Basra and ....you have humiliated the British army!!!    

Historical outcome: With no further hope of relief - a final attempt by the paddle steamer Julnar to reach the town with supplies having failed - Townshend requested and received an armistice pending surrender talks on 26 April.
