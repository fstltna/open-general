C3 - OPERATION THESEUS August15 1942

With Malta operations at full capacity, the supply situation of our forces in North Africa is  horrible. It is virtually impossible to get supplies to the troops. Before the final drive to the Nile, air and sea basis Malta has to be taken out.

Our troops have been training for this invasion for nearly a year now. XI Corps under command of Student will attack from the air with the Folgore paratrooper Division, 7th Flieger Division and La Spezia Air landing division (the air transportable units in your core). XXX and XVI Corps with most of the San Marco Regiment, a Camicie Nere Brigade, 10th Armoured Brigade and five infantry divisions will land from the sea.

The Regio Aeronautica and the Luftwaffe have moved all available planes back from the desert to regain the necessary air superiority over Malta.

Note: Deploy your air-transportable (eg infantry, light AA, light guns) and air-mobile (eg paratroopers) units in the bottom right corner. You can load up to 10 of them in planes and fly them to a captured airfield on the island of Malta.
