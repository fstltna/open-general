Kindralmajor,

Your victory at Cesis has become a symbol of national pride!  This day will be remembered for generations.

However, we may not celebrate yet.  The German troops have broken through the Latvians' southern flank and are retreating toward Riga.  You must knock them out of the town at all costs.
