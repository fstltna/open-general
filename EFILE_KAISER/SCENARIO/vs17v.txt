2nd Ypres - Gravenstafel Ridge - Chlorine Gas Test - April 23nd 1915 - V

"As this great cloud of green gray gas was forming in front of us, we suddenly heard the French yelling. In less than a minute they started with the most rifle and machine gun fire that I had ever heard. Every field artillery gun, every machine gun, every rifle that the French had, must have been firing. I had never heard such a noise. The hail of bullets going over our heads was unbelievable, but it was not stopping the gas. The wind kept moving the gas towards the French lines. We heard the cows bawling, and the horses screaming. The French kept on shooting. They couldn't possibly see what they were shooting at. In about 15 minutes the gun fire started to quit. After half an hour, only occasional shots. Then everything was quiet again."

With most of the French on the run, our objectives were easily met. HQ must not know how far we have advanced already. Rather than have us continue the attack towards Ypres, they want us to wait for another gas attack.
