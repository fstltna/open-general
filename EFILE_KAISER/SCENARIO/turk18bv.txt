Battle of Sakarya  - brilliant victory

This has been the end of the Greek offensives. They have nothing else that they can throw into us. Ankara will resist, and now we can use our growing reserves to recover all the land that Greece took away from us.

Historical outcome 
The Greeks lost the initiative of the war after Sakarya. Although the battle ended in a stalemate, Greece missed her only chance to annex large parts of Anatolia. The Turkish rebels of the Grand National Assembly had become too strong, and the Western Powers started to see them as valid interlocutors.

Soon after Sakarya, France signed the Treaty of Ankara with the rebels, ending all hostilities between both sides, and the Soviets showed their disposition to have a peace agreement with Turkey, too. That allowed the rebels to concentrate more troops against the Greeks, while the Hellenes had already exhausted all their reserves. 

Although Greece still had more soldiers on the field, their morale was decreasing quickly. Maybe, if they had settled for Smyrna, the Greeks could have kept that region for themselves, but they had been too ambitious, and now they were going to pay for their folly.

Finally, in August 1922 the Turks started a counteroffensive, with the aim of driving the Greek army out of Anatolia.
