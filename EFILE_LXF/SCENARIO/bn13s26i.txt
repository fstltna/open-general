
MULHOUSE - 14 NOV 1944

After the liberation of Southern France your forces move north and eventually link up with US forces from Normandy. You have been assigned the extreme right of the line and have the honor of freeing Alsace from the enemy. Your main objectives (from south to north) are Belfort, Mulhouse, Colmar and Strasbourg; first you must capture Belfort and Mulhouse.

GOAL: Take all VH's!

NOTE: There are large concentrations of German units between Belfort and Mulhouse, so you should capture Mulhouse from the south rather than by a direct assault.
