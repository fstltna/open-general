The First World War - Hundred Days Offensive - November, 1st, 1918

Ma chère Fabienne,
I am delighted being able to write that our brave troops have broken through the German Hindenburg line! The Hun is in full retreat. 

Austria-Hungary is dissolving. The Ottoman Empire has signed an armistice and Germany is expected to do the same soon. The smell of victory is in the air.

Marechal Foch wants us to keep on attacking in Flanders to force the Germans to surrender. I hope not  many more of our fine young men have to pay the ultimate price in the final stages of this Grande Guerre.

I promise that I will come home for good soon.

Je t'aime,
Jean-Babtiste.
