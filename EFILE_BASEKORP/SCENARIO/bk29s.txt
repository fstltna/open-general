With von Paulus's breakout from Stalingrad and your victory at Novgorod we have the opportunity to take Leningrad.  You are given this task, do not fail. Ah ... Herr General, a late communication from the front lines! The Reds have launched a massive attack on our forces near Leningrad. You must hold them long enough for your troops to take Leningrad. Capture all the ports so the Reds cannot reinforce. I recommend 4 days holding the Red advance then rapid withdrawal before your troops are overrun. Remember General you must hold the Red advance until we are in the city. The Russkie troops will not reach your positions for 2 days.
