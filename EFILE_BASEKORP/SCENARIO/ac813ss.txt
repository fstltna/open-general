Welcome General, climb in, we will talk in my command-track as we march East.

We have broken through across the whole frontier, and are racing to complete another encirclement that closes at Smolensk.

As we cross the Dnipr, your troops will support the main thrust by screening the flanks of my XXIX PzKorps.  The left flank should require little attention, however the Russians are approaching us from the South in strength, do not underestimate this threat!

Glad to have your men with us General, make sure they know the great demands to maintain speed.........and General, be sure to carry your own SMG, there are Russian stragglers everywhere!

STAFF INTEL: The Russian attack developing from the south is composed of two full Soviet armies, we are GREATLY concerned General.
