Mersa el Brega 1942

January 21st - 1942

The time for the counteroffensive has arrived. After the first victories in the past year, the British have again recaptured Cyrenaica.  Now we are in a good position to attack Mersa el Brega, and maybe then, Agedabia. If we can retake these points we will be able to siege Benghazi again and maybe recapture Cyrenaica, restoring the front lines of the past year.
