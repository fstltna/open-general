   "The Air Korps has let Us down" 02/02/42
  Ground Frau Commanders had come to expect it.How could all the SS Forces along the vast Russian Conflict Zones have Air-cover.Slowly the Fighters showing in the Skies were the weak 'Kris models as the Frau-Z's and others needed maintenance.So far nothing dramatic had happened.Was this the incident that was going to cause a little more Caution to the Frau's movement.In Moscow Joseph Stalin hoped so.So the 10th Guards of 'Helmonchek had been reinforced with some Armor of the Brits and French plus even a Group of Americans had arrived.The Frau's wore out as they was had made a Dash to not let the 10th Guards separate them from other SS forces.SS/BdM Air units had intervenned but not in the numbers the situation called for so the 10th Guards moved in to cut off 'Elfi's Gruppe.Russian Commander Borisko Lutt Helmonchek expected some aid from stragglers of the 51st Shock but most who had fought and escaped were useless,they didn't want to tangle with the Nazi Bitches again.Even shooting them to motivate them did no good.So Helmonchek would have to do it on His own with a few Allies there to Spy on the Red Army so He would make plans for His 'Friends to be used as 'Panzer Fodder' while attempting not to have His Forces become another 51st.
