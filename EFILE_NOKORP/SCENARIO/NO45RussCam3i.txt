All right, this time we've really breached their defenses: Intelligence says it's smooth sailing from here to the outskirts of Moscow.
Russians are struggling to regroup and fortify their capital.

Right now your primary task is to capture that industrial town west of there and destroy the armament factories north of it.
Your secondary task is to clean the area of all resistance and secure all landmarks we'll need for our war effort. I've marked them on your map.
You don't get any auxiliary troops, you won't need them: It will be an easy fight.



Instructions: Capture all VHs.
