01. PEARL RIDGE 2 (30 December 1944)

Operations in the central sector continue. All American troops have left Boungainville and all is up to us Diggers! To ensure the best defense positions in the central sector it is vital to capture Pearl Ridge from where we can look out to the ocean on the otherside of the island. Right now the Japanese are able to overlook Torokina and spot our movements: this cannot last!

All current positions have to be held. Air support will be given by RAAF 5 Squadron. 9th Battalion has been replaced by 25th Battalion, also under command of 7th Brigade. Good luck, General!
