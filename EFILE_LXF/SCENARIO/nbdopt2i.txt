Commander, due to your splendid performance here in Africa, we have been able to arrange a little rest period for you and your men at our HQ in Gafsa. Sorry we couldn't send you back to Casablanca for some real action, but there is a Hospital (Sorry, Boys, but the Nurses are Nuns), a church and a Juice bar. 

The Main Purpose is for you and you men to rest up and you will have a chance to reequip your tired units. Sorry but replacements are limited and you can't add new units, only upgrade.

However, we have managed to capture a lot of enemy equipment. Take your time perusing the inventory and see if there is any equipment you might find useful. Some of it is top quality, but once again you can't add new units, only upgrade.

Warning: Do not overstay your welcome. The Luftwaffe has been staging unpredictable raids all over the region from long-range bombers out of Pantelleria.
