51 B.C. : The big state parliament

All the army leaders have appeared to the great state parliament in Alesia ..... this has not happened for generations .....
Vercingetorix orders an advance into the heart of the enemy: We will cross the Alps with all our men and advance straight to Rome ..... All the enemies foolish enough to stand in our way, will be destroyed ....

Vercingetorix has to remain in Gaul for strategic reasons, in order to bring some isolated fools, still loyal to Rome, to their senses, and to take care on all the small uprisings.
He gave the supreme command for the revenge campaign ......... you!

As once our great ancestor Brennus, we will take Rome, and this time there will be no geese on the Capitol detaining us.....
Vae Victim! ... as the Romans say .....
Let the Carnix sound for the departure!
On to the Alps!
