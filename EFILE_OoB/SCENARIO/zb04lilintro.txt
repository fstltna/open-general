Lillehammer

....

The British have landed troops at Åndalsnes while the Norwegians continue to offer strong resistance on both sides of Lake Mjøsa. 

Join the Kampfgruppen advancing along the shores of the lake and drive them forward to capture Lillehammer quickly, before the enemy can establish a strong defensive position there and at the entrance of the Gubrandsdal.

KG Fischer is advancing up the Østerdal on your right flank; KG Zanthier will link up with you from the west.
