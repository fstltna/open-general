Antwerp - von Beseler's Mistake - September 4th 1914

Extensive reconnaisance has shown a lot of Belgian activity along the Mechelen-Dendermonde railroad. Our spies near the Belgian coast have reported that more and more English troops are entering Belgium. These and other signs indicate that the Belgians and the English are plugging the gap between Antwerp and the North of France. We expect that the Belgium Army will conduct another sortie from Antwerp to support these plans.

We are sending three columns to intercept this Belgian attack:
1. The whole of [IXReserve] corps will operate on your left (off-map) and will move NW towards Dendermonde.
2. Your 6.Reserve Division of [IIReserve] Corps will also move NW to intercept troops coming from the fortresses South of Antwerp and to prevent other troops from retreating that way.
3. III.Btn/35.Res.Inf.Rgt (of your division) will move NE to blow up the bridges over the Willebroeksche Vaart and block a Belgian retreat in that direction.

The 5.Reserve Division of [IIReserve] Corps will guard the approach to Brussels from Mechelen - where the first Belgian exit took place.
