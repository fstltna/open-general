06. Besieging a Citadel (5 November 1944)

Thanks to the success of our attack on October 28th, another attack will be made on Dunkirk.  We hope to persuade the German commander into surrendering since we lack the strength of doing this by only military means.  Therefore, once again, a limited action will take place like the previous assault.  This time the Germans might not be as surprised!  Good luck.
