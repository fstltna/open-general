05. SORAKEN (11 March 1945)

After advancing through rough terrain and jungle, we stand now at the Nagan River. The area around the village of Soraken is important to the Japanese because of the food production. The area has considerable garden cultivation and its loss would be a major blow to the Japanese position in northern Bougainville. 

For this operation most of your battalion will cross the Nagan River from Down's Hill. However two companies, that have embarked at Puto, will land at the western side of the Soraken peninsula in order to cut off the route of retreat if the Japanese on the peninsula would try to flee. You must take the entire Soraken area and advance to the outskirts of Buoi. Good luck, General!
