"Otto! Otto! Come here! You know what tovarish leytenant spoked about with the guards? Guess what? Stalin had died! Otto, this is great news! Maybe we'll be finally repatriated! It's my only hope, because I won't survive another woodcutter season, I feel it in my bones. Mein Gott, if only this was true!"

"My best holiday experience.

Since the beginning of August my grandma was very nervous and she cried very often. She told me that my grandpa will return home. She showed me his photograph and many times I couldn't go out with other girls, because grandma wished to talk with me about grandpa and it was sometimes boring.
Then finally a day has come when grandpa returned. He came back in a train with a red star  on the front. There were many people on the railroad station, because other soldiers also returned. They came out of the train and the mayor talked with them for long. When he spoke with my grandpa he named him Herr Gelb Marschal which is strange, because my grandpa's name is Otto.
Then finally they released him. Grandma ran to him and she cried and they talked much.
Then grandpa looked at me and he also started to cry. It was very embarrassing. I told him to not cry and I also told him that I don't like him, that he was much younger on a photo that grandma showed me and if he's really our grandpa and if the Russians didn't give us a false grandpa. He laughed much and then he hugged me and kissed me and it was so strange that now it was me who was crying. But it wasn't that embarassing, after all I'm just a girl, but my grandpa isn't.
Then we've climbed on the wagon and went home. Grandma asked him what he wants for a dinner, that she may either cook a cony or a chicken. Grandpa said that he doesn't care, but that he wants a beer and yet something else, but this I didn't understood.
I am very glad that my grandparents are together. They don't have anyone else than me, so once I'll merry, they won't be alone."
