Alam Halfa Battle

August 31st, 1942

High Command thinks that it's time to strike the enemy again, like in the past, surprising the Allies from the South. Your task is to surround the enemy from the South, and capture the Alexandria Supplyline. The Alam Halfa ridge is an important and strategic place, you must secure it also. Viel Gluck!.

Historically, the Germans had an important lack of supplies, fuel, and tanks. This attack was ordered due to political pressures, a quick victory was needed...
