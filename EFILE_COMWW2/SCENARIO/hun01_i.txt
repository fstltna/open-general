March 19, 1939

General, as you know, we regained some of the territories that we had lost by the Treaty of Trianon after the Great War. The First Vienna Award (one of the consequences of the Munich Agreement) separated 12.000 km2 territories from Czechoslovakia and awarded them to Hungary on November 2, 1938. On March 14, 1939 the Slovak people proclaimed their independence from Czecho-Slovakia. The very next day Wehrmacht invaded Bohemia and Moravia, and Hitler gave us permission to occupy the rest of Subcarpathia (10.000 km2), north up to the Polish border. This mission has just been complished. In our interpretation, the eastern Slovak boundary was only an internal Czechoslovak administrative line, not an internationally recognized boundary, and therefore in need of defining now that Subcarpathia has passed into our hands.

General, Governor Horthy is afraid that negotiations would make no sense and Germany will guarantee current lines as Slovakia's borders. So you must act quickly! Attack the unprepared Slovaks, push the frontier back to a safe distance beyond the western watershed of the Ung Valley and protect Ungvár and the key railway to Poland.
