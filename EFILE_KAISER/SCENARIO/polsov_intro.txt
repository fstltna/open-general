Following the end of WWI, an independent Polish state was established in territories that had previously been part of the Austro-Hungarian, German, and Russian Empires. These territories had existed since the partitions of Poland in the 18th century.

The new 2nd Polish Republic quickly reclaimed territories that, although populated by Poles, were under the rule of the Soviet Republics of Russia and Ukraine. Poland's President, Józef Pilsudski, thought that since the Russian Civil War was at its peak, the Red Army would be weakened and it would be possible to expand Polish borders to the east.

The war that followed was a terrible test for Poland which was on the brink of disappearing due to the intense pressure from the Red Army. However, the Polish were able to recover and finally managed to conquer many Eastern territories that would become part of Poland until 1939.
