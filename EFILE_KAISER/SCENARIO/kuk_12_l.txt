Things were going quite well before they wounded you. Don't worry, with the help of the Germans we'll manage to break through the Russian lines. In the following weeks nobody will be able to stop our advance. Soon, we'll liberate Premissel, Lemberg and all of Galizien. Besides, if they want to rebuild their lines, the Russians will have to retreat from the Warschau salient, too. When the front line stabilizes, we'll be fighting inside the Russian Empire. There is some bad news, though.  Italy will declare war on the Empire before the end of the month, so we'll have to deploy troops on three different fronts. 

But don't think about it now. You must heal from those wounds first. It will take just a few months. Before you can notice, you'll be back on the front line.
