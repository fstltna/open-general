The situation in New Guinea has reached a standstill. Our advance has reached Saidor, but the Japanese 41st Division has dug in along the route of our advance and brought our offensive to a stop. Commander, you will relieve the 32nd Division and break the Japanese defenses. The Japanese grow more fanatical as they are gradually losing ground, so expect them to throw everything they have at you.
