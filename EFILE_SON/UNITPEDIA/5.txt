It is a High-Caliber Battery, with large range, heavy attack and weak defense values. It has three special skills: it can capture a flag hex, it can attack naval targets and it can use rail transport (RTP).

This gun was the heaviest field artillety weapon of the Hungarian Army. At the beginnings of the Revolution only a few pieces of 12-pdr guns stationed in the military warehouses.
