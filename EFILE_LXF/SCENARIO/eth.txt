1934-41 THE WAR OF THE NEGUS
Ethiopian Campaign

The Italo-Ethiopian War is often seen as a precursor to World War II.

The fascist dictator of Italy, Benito Mussolini, had long held the desire for an Italian Empire to rule over the Mediterranean.  He often talked of building a new Roman Empire.

Ethiopia was a prime candidate of this expansionist goal for several reasons. It was one of the few African nations not currently belonging to a European power and it would serve to unify the Italian held Eritrea in the North-West and Italian Somaliland in the East. It was also considered to be militarily weak and rich in resources.

You will take the command of the ill-armed and poorly trained Ethiopian army.

Enjoy!
