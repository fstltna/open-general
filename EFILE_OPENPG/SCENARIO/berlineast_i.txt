The war in the east has not gone well. The Soviets have proven to be unstoppable, and are now advancing across German soil. You must stop them and push them back along the entire front by taking all objectives, however, if you can hold onto a minimum of six objectives, we may be able to obtain tolerable armistice terms. This is the final battle; you face either death or glory.
