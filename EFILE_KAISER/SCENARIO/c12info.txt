SEVASTOPOL (11 November 1920)

It all does not matter anymore, comrade.  Strategy?  We want victory!  The Tsarist monarchists know their fate.  Their dream of a Russia full of slaves they can control is gone!  The people have stood up against this injustice and united itself to drive out the capitalist oppressors!

There are clear signs that the capitalists from London will send the Royal Navy to Russia and attempt to evacuate Wrangel and his forces.  Comrade, this shows the lies told by the British and Wrangel.  How are they to evacuate a massive army?  Most likely they will only bring him and a few others to safety while the rest await the mercy of the glorious people's army!

Now, go forward and hunt down the criminals of the people of Russia before they can get away!
