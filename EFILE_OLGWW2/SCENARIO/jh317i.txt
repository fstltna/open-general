Herr Feldmarschall.  We have obtained an armistice with England and the United States.  Bravo!  But while we were conquering England the Bolsheviks treacherously broke our armistice with them and invaded our allied territories in Eastern Europe.  With the bulk of our forces in England and Afrika the situation is critical. Your forces are the only units standing between them and Berlin. You MUST stop them.
