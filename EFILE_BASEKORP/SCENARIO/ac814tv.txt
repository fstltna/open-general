General!

Your troop's attack on the left managed to support the conduct of this encirclement, however I am concerned over your losses.

You and your men fought bravely and are a great example of Axis cooperation, I would however like you to sign this after battle report that specifically mentions that our tanks are having increasing problems in dealing with the Russian heavy armor.....

With luck, we can soon end this war as we hope to take Moscow.
