I felt great happiness when the Reds surrendered and the cossacks entered Orenburg. With the liberation of the city we could finally control the railways that we needed to communicate all our battle front from north to south, so as long as the Czechs did their jobs we could send supplies and reinforcements very quickly to any sector that could need it.

The Soviets knew that their situation was desperate, so when May started they launched a massive counteroffensive. It was their last chance to prevent us from reaching the Volga, but they didn't have time to plan their attacks thoroughly and in most places it was easy to repel them. However, they succeeded in retaking Chistopol, on the left shore of the Kama. If the communists consolidated that position our chances to recover Kazan would be gone. Since we had already dealt with a similar situation in Orenburg, Kolchak sent us to liberate Chistopol.
