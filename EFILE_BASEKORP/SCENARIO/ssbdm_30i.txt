    The Factories at Kolshaznol 
  SS/BdM Air Fuhress Inga Stercghassmann had Her Bomber Fleets up and running now.The Kondor's of the Fleets were getting the Point across to Stalin that in time He would lose the War if He did not stop the Flying Fraus.With Frau-Z recons dashing across the Skies 100's of kilometers behind the Lines and reporting back for Inga to survey what She wanted obliterated Stalin knew the Nazi Fleets had to be stopped.The Russians still had plenty of planes and Pilots of course but Stalin made a request to His Allies to aid in the Skies over Mother Russia in better numbers.American and Soviet planners knew attrition should in the End get both the Sneaky Japs and the SS Bitches if the casulties weren't too outrageous which of course the Soviets were.In Berlin the War Cabinet knew Joseph Stalin's procedures of Fear and Death towards His own People that the Horrendous numbers lost at the Fronts meant if the Great Cities of the Soviet Union was in the hands of the SS Stalins grip on them and especially Soviet officers would be the Soviets End and the Country would revert into Civil War causing it's downfall. Leningrad was already in SS Hands,another few months and Moscow would be if the Soviet Armor showing up in the Center Front could be in lesser numbers.The Destruction of the Factories at Kolshaznol was part of the Answer.

This a "torched earth" policy and everything must be destroyed before we leave the area.
