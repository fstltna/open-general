German and Axis Campaign 1938-1946
You take command of Axis troops from the civil war in Spain, to the victories of early World War II and beyond.
This is not a "blitzkrieg" campaign. Battles are hard fought and won.

Sometimes it is best to bypass the enemy instead of trying to destroy him.
Paras are not essential but are helpful. 2 is all that is required.
Repair crews, saboteurs and mineclearers are also useful units for this campaign. One of each is adequate.
Germany is the main country but other Axis nations are support countries and the campaign could be played using any of these countries. 

You can play all 47 scenarios or a lot less as this is a modular campaign.
This is a different campaign from Base AAW.
