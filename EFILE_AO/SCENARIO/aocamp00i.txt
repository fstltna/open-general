July 30th, 1952
Outskirts of Thule Air Force Base, Greenland
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Morning, Commander.  I hope you're rested and ready because today the high and mighty are throwing your men right into the shit.

We took this goddamned iceberg from the Danes during the war and we're sure as hell not going to give it up now.  Construction on the airbase at Thule has been underway for at least a year and it might take another just to lay the finishing touches.  When it's done, this base is going to give us one of the straightest shots for a bomber run into mother Russia herself.

That's why the higher ups are getting a bit antsy, Commander.  We've lost contact with some of the smaller villages east of Thule, and the only intel we've got is a broken radio report of armed soldiers entering one of the town squares.  There's obviously some kind of paramilitary threat out there, and we need to put it down.  

You and your boys will be making an amphibious landing on the northern end of the inhabited area, where you will rendezvous with some MP units maintaining control there.  Reinforcements are on standby to come in if the situation turns out to be FUBAR.

Not much to go off, Commander, I know.  But I assume the brass trained you Anomalous Operations guys for a reason.  If you need anything, just ask for Carter.  I'll be around.

Carter out.
