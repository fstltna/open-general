Herr General,
You are to continue your drive West towards Amiens.


Reform your Corps around the Sissone-Mountcoronet region and push westwards towards Laon and capture the city. Laon should be held as it is vital to our lines of communication and supply.

Cross the Oise river and take Saint Quentin where we will setup HQ for the next push.
