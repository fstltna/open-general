VICTORY

Several days of heavy fighting have taken place with both sides having lost thousands of men and hundreds of vehicles. But in the end the fascists couldn't drive us into the Prut River. We still have our bridgehead over the Prut River near Jassy. Preparations for the invasion of Rumania are taking place.
