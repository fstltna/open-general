Good work comrade Zhukov. But unfortunately, even though we managed to encircle the 1st Panzer Armee and capture Kamenets-Podolsk, the Germans have counter-attacked, cutting off our forces, thus their breakout attempt continues. You have been re-assigned as STAVKA coordinator to both General Rokossovsky's 1st Belorussian Front, and General Zakharov's 2nd Belorussian Front...
