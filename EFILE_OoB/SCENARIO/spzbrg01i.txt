Lesser Poland

Part 2/4 of the "Blitzkrieg" minicampaign


"Hauptmann! Hauptmann Bistroff! Are you alright? Fine... Now listen carefully!

You're far behind the Polish defense! Coil back to the lines of contact and attack the rear of the enemy! Make sure... Hauptmann, are you there?! What? Ah so! Is it better now? Listen! Air recon says that the Poles are holding the bridge! You must capture it intact, understand?! Once you secure the bridge, follow further south, still further south! Poles are retreating towards you! You must clear the whole area! Hauptmann...! Hauptmann! I don't hear you!

Listen! THEY! HAVE! TANKS! Do you hear me? Hauptmann! DO YOU HEAR ME! They're moving from the borders deeper inland! Hauptmann! Oh! Hauptmann Bistroff! I don't hear you! I don't hear you! Scheisse!

Hauptmann, are you there?! TAKE BLOODY CARE OF THEIR TANKS! WE'RE SENDING IN THE LUFTWAFFE!

Over!"


Victory conditions: Capture all VHs.

Hint: The rest of your battalion needs to refuel, they'll follow you in one hour. Luftwaffe is on their way. So are our comrades of the Slovak rapid brigade. Run forward to your objectives, don't worry about garrisoning the VHs, the stragglers can guard them.

Core reinforces (1/3): For the rest of the Polish campaign, you'll command an armoured battalion.
