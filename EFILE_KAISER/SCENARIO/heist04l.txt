The retreat from Narva has turned into a rout.  The 4th Narva regiment has all but ceased to exist as desertion and defeatism spread through the ranks.  The German forces have pulled out of Estonia completely, leaving us to our own fate.  With the capture of the regimental HQ, which you miraculously avoided, you have been given the opportunity to re-form the regiment in the rank of Kolonel.  You must make way toward Tallinn to prepare the final stand of the republic against Soviet agression.
