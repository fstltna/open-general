The White forces during the Russian Civil War

The Red forces roam over most of Russia. All that you have learnt to love seems to be dying under the Bolshevik yoke. But you, along with a handful of fellow officers, are determined to make a last stand and save your beloved motherland. You won't leave without a fight. In the end, the Communist hordes will be defeated, or you'll die trying.
