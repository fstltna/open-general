Yes, yes, I can't believe it either. After so many years of service, after surviving so many dangerous situations, after so many victories...just a few weeks away from retirement, the General was killed in one of the last engagements of the war. It seems that his car was shelled by some unspotted German mortars. It's a tragedy. The war is already won, but a man like him would have been very useful during the peace time. May his soul rest in peace.
