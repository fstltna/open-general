Gospodin General-Leitenant, expending the last possible reserves, you have pushed your men to achieve their objectives in the face of stubborn Austrian resistance - and even offensive action.  The tactical successes of the South-Western Front's Carpathian offensives during the winter and spring of 1915 have not approached the strategic goals set by Stavka.  Plagued by severe ammunition shortage, manpower attrition, and a chronic disarray of the armies' supply structure, the Russian offensive came to a grinding halt.

Realizing little of the precariousness of the situation, Stavka continued to plan for dual offensives by the North-Western and South-Western fronts for the summer of 1915.  In the hopes of continuing the offensive, no significant effort was given to the construction of defensive works along the front.  By May significant portions of active units had withdrawn to the rear to refit, leaving dangerous gaps in the line.
