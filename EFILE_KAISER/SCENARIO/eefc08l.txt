LOSS
-----------------------------------
Our losses have been appaling. The Turkish redoubts proved to be too strong, and this attack again ended as a great failure.  Our forces have been weakened too much, so we can't hold our line against a possible Turkish counter-attack. So retreat to our starting positions is the reasonable choice.

By the way, I heard rumors that General Murray is going to be relieved from his post after these two disastrous battles. Hopefully, our next commander in chief will do better.
