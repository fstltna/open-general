The way to Vladivostok

August, 1944

We have finally reached the northern chain of mountains that is our last obstacle on the way to Vladivostok and surely to wars end.  The Germans have re-taken the offensive on the European eastern front, and the USSR is in a bad position now.  They are isolated fighting against the Axis.  The Trans-Siberian Railroad is cut, and now it's time to drive to Vladivostok by passing thought the mountains.  The soviets have made some fortifications but they won't be strong enough to deter your forces.

The new ''White Russians'' brigade made with anti-Bolshevik Russians captured in Khabarovsk is now under your direct command.
