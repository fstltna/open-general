Commander, I'm sorry for keeping you in the dark.  My wounds from Aberdeen weren't lethal, but they incapacitated me long enough to keep me from attracting the attention of that deranged computer.  Once I realized what was going on I figured it would be better to lay low and find the right moment to strike.

The power sources you secured previously went not towards the time machine but towards the repair of several decommissioned weapons plants outside the city, which Pegasus used to construct its army.  The time machine is still fully functional.  It always has been.

This is a future that we can't abide, Commander.  It's time to head back and make it right.

We're all ready when you are.  Carter out.
