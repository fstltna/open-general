Cuba: Las Guásimas

June 24th, 1898

A nice day, isn't it? Finally, we have a great opportunity to expel the Spaniards from Cuba. Over the past 50 years, we tried to buy the island many times, but they always rejected our offers. The three hopeless wars against the Cuban independentists, the thousands of Spanish soldiers that have died, and all the money that they've spent don't seem to matter. Spain has refused to leave Cuba and let us be in charge. 

Well, the time for peaceful solutions is over. The Spaniards didn't want to negotiate, and what have they achieved? A war. Our ships have been bombarding the Cuban and the Philippine coasts for two months and now the land operations have started.

Disembarking in Siboney was extremely easy. Now we're supposed to flank the other brigade of our division, but you know what? We've spotted some Spanish troops in Las Guásimas, guarding the road to Santiago. Wouldn't it be good to have some action after that terrible journey by sea?


Victory conditions:
- Take the enemy VH.
