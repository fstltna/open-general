1916 Anyera campaign

June, 29th, 1916

Message from General Gómez Jordana's HQ:

General, welcome back to Morocco. You haven't missed much action these past two years. Spain is determined to remain neutral in the Great War that is devastating Europe, and among other things that means that we must keep the local "status quo" in Morocco at all costs. If we started huge military campaigns that would undoubtedly affect the French interests in Morocco. We wish to avoid that, so things have been quite calm here. 

Anyway, it's time to do something with the Anyera "kabila". The Anyera are ferocious and independent people, who obey neither Spain nor the Sultan of Morocco. Their territory is very close to the Spanish town of Ceuta, and the control of the area is vital for securing the roads to Tangier and Tetuán, so we must end the rebellion there.

We will attack the Anyera from Ceuta in the north and from Tetuan in the south. You will command the northern attack. On the south we'll have the support of our old enemy, El Raisuli. The Anyera don't follow him, either, so he sees this campaign as an opportunity to gain more power and wealth. Besides, his past defeats have convinced him that he'd better see Spain as an ally, not as an enemy. At least for the moment, we can count on him.


Victory conditions: Take all VHs.
