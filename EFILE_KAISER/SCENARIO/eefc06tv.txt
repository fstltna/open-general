TACTICAL VICTORY
---------------------------------
Praise the Lord! A last minute victory! When news arrived that a Turkish relief force was approaching from the east, it was decided to call off the attack and retreat back towards El Arish. However, as evening approached and orders were being issued to disengage, your troops mounted a final and successful charge against the Turkish redoubts.

The storming of the earthworks at Magruntein was immediately followed by the collapse of the whole enemy resistance. The Turkish reinforcements withdrew when they discovered the fall of the position. With victory at Rafa, we are now in a position to advance into Palestine, but to do so would require the capture of the Turkish fortress of Gaza...
