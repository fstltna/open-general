November 30 1939

Good Morning Major. The situation with the Soviet Union has rapidly deteriorated. As you know, they have been demanding 2700 square kilometers of our territory in the Karelian Isthmus, as well as some of our islands in the Gulf of Finland and the town of Hanko in the south coast. Stalin has offered in exchange the Porajarvi and Repola districts in East Karelia. After the last negotiations on Nov 13, Molotov was overheard to say, "Since we civilians can't achieve anything, the matter has to be left to the militairy personnel". Then, on Nov 26, after falsely accusing us of shelling their militairy base at Mainila, Stalin has demanded that we should apologize for the incident and  move our forces 20-25 kilometers from the border! The Soviet Union is looking for any little reason to attack us, and we will not give in to their demands, so Major, be on your guard!
