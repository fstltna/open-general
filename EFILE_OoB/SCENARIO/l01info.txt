01. FORTRESS HOLLAND (10 May 1940)

To the commanding officer of 22. ID (LL):

After months of preparations the Wehrmacht will launch its offensive in the West. Your division has been trained as gliderforce and received the extension "Luftlande" to its name. At X-Zeit, 0355 hours 10 May 1940, Germany will attack!

The attack on the heart of Holland, Fortress Holland, will be performed by 7. Flieger Division and your 22. ID (LL) supported by Luftwaffe formations. The plan is as following. Gruppe Sud will capture the Dordrecht and Moerdijk Bridges, which will be executed by fallschirmjager only. Gruppe Nord will capture the city of Rotterdam and its airfield, Waalhaven. Gruppen Valkenburg, Iepenburg and Ockenburg will capture the airfields carrying the respective name. All attacks against the airfields will be made by a fallschirmjager landing followed by clearing the airfields so the Ju-52 carrying your division, can land and unload. We are unsure about the Dutch strength but expect the worst, both in the air as on the ground. But let nothing stop the landing of the Ju-52s! 9. Panzer Division will link up with your forces if the Dutch refuse to surrender.

RULES: 
- Do not upgrade, sell or buy units - nor upgrading transports.
- Only deploy IR-16, IR-47 and IR-65 (all your REGULAR "Infanterie" units)

NOTE: In order to load your units into airtransports you have to right-click on your unit and click on "Embark". Your airtransports can ONLY land at airfields.
