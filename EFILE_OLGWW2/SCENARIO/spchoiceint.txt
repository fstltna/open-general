This is a choice scenario, after the fall of Egypt and the defeat of the Allied invaders of the Vichy France African territories, you should decide where the Deutsches Afrika Korps will go this time. We have made two different plans;

BV: This means to select the plan proposed by our Italian friends: the recapturing of Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somaliland, and then, going towards the South following the Nile river.

V or TV: By selecting this path, you will go to ensure the Mediterranean Sea, the oil paths and the chance to open a second front in the Caucasus, piercing into Persia.

The fate of Afrika is in your hands.
