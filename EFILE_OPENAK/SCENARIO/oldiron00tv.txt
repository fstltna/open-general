00. Operation Torch - Landing at Oran - TV

French batteries and ships of our invasion fleet exchanged fire throughout November 8-9-10-11 and French troops defended the area surrounding Oran stubbornly. But heavy fire from HMS Rodney brought about Oran's surrender on 11 November (2 days later than was the case historically).

In Morocco a coup d'état of pro-Allied General Antoine Béthouart failed, but French troops surrendered on November 10th after heavy fighting on the beaches and a Naval battle at Cassablanca.

French opposition at Algiers was extremely light and the city surrendered at 18:00 on November8th - the day of the landings.
