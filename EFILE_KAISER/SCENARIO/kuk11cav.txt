NOTES:
- The HQ Inf represents your headquarters. You must keep this unit alive during the whole campaign!
- There is a 1 SP "trap" unit in each scenario to prevent a sudden victory by killing all enemy units. Please don't kill it if you discover its position.
- Use the gathered PP on reinforcing your units (don't keep it, if you are near the cap), at the end of the scenarios they won't be refit automatically.
- Units lose 25% of their actual experience when upgraded.
- All core units are free (don't count against the cap).
- You can't purchase new units, but you can repurchase the lost units -- though losing a core is not recommended.
- Attachments are available. They give +1 bonus only, but no malus.
- It's an Austro-Hungarian campaign, don't expect an "all BVs" record :)
