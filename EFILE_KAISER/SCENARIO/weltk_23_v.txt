Victory! The war is over! Knowing that their Empire could be at risk, the British government has accepted our proposal for a Peace With Honour. 
Under the terms of this treaty Britain will acknowledge our gains from the war, whilst we'll respect the imperial possessions of Britain, Japan and Portugal. Our former colonies will be returned, and our allies will obtain significative territorial gains, too.

These past five years have been terrible. The war has strained the economy of every country and proved the weaknesses of both Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire, but in the end Germany has become the main military power in the world and, if we act wisely, soon we'll be the richest country, too.

None of this would have been possible without you. You'll be remembered as one of the greatest German heroes of all time. And I know that the Kaiser would be glad to appoint you as the next Chief of the General Staff. What do you think of that? Would you accept to serve your country for a little longer? Whaterver your answer is, let me say this: Feldmarschall, I salute you.

The campaign is over. I hope you've liked it and thanks for playing.
