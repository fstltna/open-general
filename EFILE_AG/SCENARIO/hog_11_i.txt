51 BC. : Bella Italia

We have crossed the Alps and are here for the first time on Italian soil .....

In the plain, a Roman army is waiting for us ... in fact, it is a consular army: it is personally led by one of the consuls!

[The Supreme druid approaches towards you:] 
.... the Romans seem quite desperate to send their consul to us personally .....!
But there are always TWO consuls .... I think the Romans will again use one of their favorite strategies: as we turn to the consular army in the plane, there will surely be a second in our back .....!

We should be very careful, and protect our back through many scouts and a large reserve ....
