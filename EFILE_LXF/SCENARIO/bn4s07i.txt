
METSOVO PASS - 19 APR 1941

South of Grevena, West Macedonia

After your breakthrough at Lake Kastoria we could not hold open the gap for long time and only a few troops could escaped. You have now the Germans before and behind! A German SS unit, passed Lake Kastoria before, is already on their way to Metsovo pass and there is now the opportunity to attack this force from behind! Prevent the blockade of the Metsovo pass and allow further comrades to escape!

GOAL: Take all VHs!

NOTE: Due to the short time between the missions at HQ no new units can be recruited!
