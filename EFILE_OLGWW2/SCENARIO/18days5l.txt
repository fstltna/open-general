General,

You have disappointed us. If you are not able to stop the Germans in well prepared positions, less will you able to command troops in the offensive.  

A new mission is waiting for you. Go to the canteen and let's hope you are able to cook a good "Carbonnade flamande".

Le Chef d'Etat-major général de l’armée (EMGA).

Historical note:

The troops at the "Ligne KW" (Dyle position) river were not particularly hard pressed and two attempts to cross the Dijle/Dyle River around Leuven/Louvain were fairly easily beaten off.

However, as a complete surprise, on 16th May the BEF started to leave their positions at the Dijle/Dyle river. Soon orders came for the Belgian army to retreat. The Germans had broken trough at Sedan and were racing towards the coast threatening to cut of the Armies in Belgium from the main body of the French army.
