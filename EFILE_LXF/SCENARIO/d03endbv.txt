BRILLIANT VICTORY

Contact has been established with Samarinda once again and elite demolition teams have been evacuated. The oil fields are blown up too. Good thing you spotted those Japanese Marines cutting off your route of retreat before it was too late. More and more Japanese are landing and Balikpapan will soon be Japanese. You and your men must march south to Bandjermasin where you will be picked up and be transported to Java for the final battle for the East Indies.
