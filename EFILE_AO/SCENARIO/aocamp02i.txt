October 25th, 1953
Outskirts of Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Commander, something very unusual has happened.  All forms of communication with Holloman Air Force Base have been down for almost twenty four hours, and the higher ups have no idea why.  We dispatched an infantry company to Holloman several hours ago to ascertain the nature of the problem, but they never reported back to us either, and a huge sandstorm is preventing the operation of aircraft within the region.

So we're sending you in.  We are completely uncertain as to the nature of the problem, Commander, but it's possible that the Soviets have decided for some reason to hit this airbase.  If this is true, we may be on the verge of a nuclear war.  Take your men in, secure Holloman, and if there is indeed a threat, hold your ground until heavier reinforcements can arrive.

Local weather conditions seem to be clear for the moment, so if you have any pilots itching to get their flying time in, now's as good as ever.  Don't expect any help from the other airbases though; their lungs are still filled with sand.

Carter out.
