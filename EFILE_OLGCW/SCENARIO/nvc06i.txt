Attack on Khe Sanh

January, 1968

Good morning comrade commander. As you know, our campaign of attacking enemy forward bases continues.  Khe Sanh is the provincial capital and the key towards controlling our national Route 9. Your mission is to coordinate the attack against the Yankee base at Khe Sanh. That base is a constant threat against our supply routes through Laos.

After crossing the Ho Chi Minh trail you must deploy your troops to the north of Khe Sanh.  Clear the hills of any enemy troops and then undertake the attack on the enemy base. Reinforcements from the west and the east will arrive to help in the struggle against the enemy positions.
