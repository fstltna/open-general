Although we defended ourselves quite well at Landrecies and Grand Fayt, our retreat was too hasty. We left the II Corp's right flank exposed, so they nearly got trapped by the enemy at Le Cateau. We could do nothing but follow our march  to the South: fortunately the enemy dared not to pursue us for a few days.
