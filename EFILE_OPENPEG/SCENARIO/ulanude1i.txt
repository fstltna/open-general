Ulan Ude, Siberia, Russia
The People’s Republic of China finally realized where the greatest danger to its plans lies and has managed to reinforce its armies in Siberia. A considerable force has assembled at Ulan Ude and is fortifying its forward defenses. Fortunately, control of the Trans-Siberian Railroad has allowed the Russians forces to move rapidly into position and they will join your army in an assault on Ulan Ude. This joint effort will establish positions along the Trans-Siberian Railroad and secure vital industrial centers on the Selenga River.
