Serbia is falling

Oct 7th, 1915

Finally, the time has come for the decisive offensive against Serbia. One month ago, Bulgaria joined our side, and now they are ready to fight, just like the Germans and ourselves. To make things better, the French and the British have been too slow, and their troops are still in Greece. They won't arrive in time to save their ally. 

We'll attack Serbia from all sides. The Bulgarians will come from the east, taking Nis and Macedonia. The German 11th Army will invade northeastern Serbia, and finally we'll cross the Drina and the Danau from the west and the north. This time our enemies won't have a chance.

Since you already know the area, you'll command the operations against Belgrad. The city is fortified, and their defences include some pieces of heavy artillery, but with the help of the German XXII Reserve Korps it will be easy to outflank and destroy our enemies. Go ahead, General, the victory will be ours!

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.
