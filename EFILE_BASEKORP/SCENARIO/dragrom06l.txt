    Panzerkampfwagen IV was designated as T-4 in Romanian Army service.
On 9 October 1942, 1st Tank Regiment of 1st Romanian Armored Division received 11 T-3 (Pzkpfw III N) and 11 T-4 (Pzkpfw IV G) tanks, that formed two medium tank companies. During the battle of Don's Bend, 1st Tank Regiment lost 10 of the 11 T-4 tanks.

    In early 1943, Romanian Ministry of Army Endowment and War Production placed an order of 150 T-3 and T-4 tanks and 56 self-propelled guns, quantities that had to be delivered by Germany within two years. The delivery was slow and by August 1944 only a total of 110 T-4 tanks had been received.

   Delivery included PzKpfw IV F, G, H anf J models. Some of these tanks were already worn as they were conveyed from 23rd Panzer Division. Thirty T-4 tanks serviced in the Mixed Armored Group "Cantemir", formed on 24 February 1944, that actioned on Moldavian front until April. Thirty-two pieces serviced in the Fast Armored Detachment, a training and intervention unit formed on March 28 1944, which also actioned on Moldavian front. Forty-eight T-4 tanks endowed 1st Regiment of 1st Armored Division. During the fights between 19 and 23 August 1944 in Moldavia, 1st Armored Division suffered heavy losses.
