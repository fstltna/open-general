AC 072 - Battle at Firmum Picenum (Schlacht bei Firmum Picenum)

Look at one: We know them yet! In front of us are the contracted troops of Lentulus, Gellius and Arrius, or what's left of it them. It's time to destroy them finally …

Historical:
After the turn to the south, Spartacus met the newly organized Roman legions, probably under the joint command of Lentulus, Gellius and Arrius. They again experienced a setback. 
So Spartacus stood shortly thereafterbefore Rome. He did not lay siege to the city and moved even further south.
It took half a century that an enemy,  the Visigoth Alaric,  again stood an enemy army before Rome.
