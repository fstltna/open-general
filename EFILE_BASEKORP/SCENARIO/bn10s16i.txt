Basra, Iraq

After the fall of Basra, the last Commonwealth troops in Iraq withdrew on the Faw Peninsula and wait for their evacuation. Due to the loss of the port in Basra, only a small harbor at Al Qushlah remains for embarkation. If we act quickly it should possible to capture most of these troops. Air support for your attack is ensured - Iran has allowed the use of their airfield at Abadan by our Luftwaffe.
