August 3rd, 1952
Thule Air Force Base, Greenland
----------------------------------------------------
Cat's out of the bag, Commander.  The Soviets know we're on to them and they seem to have thrown their whole little covert invasion force directly into the open;  the Reds have established several beachheads near Thule.  The stragglers who survived your initial assault have linked up with the guys on the beach, and I'd be willing to bet they're planning to seize the airfield.

Commander, you know how important this base is, and you know we can't let Ivan have it.  It'll jeopardize everything we've worked for.  Take your men and push west towards your objectives; we've got a couple pieces of armor stationed near Thule that should help you gain the initiative, so you should have a fairly easy time of it.  Drive Ivan off our island.

Carter out.
