You are here, General. Just in time! Since December the Russians have started a major counterattack against the German front: our friends have problems but will manage. Days ago Russian forces started another counterattack in the Caucasus region to recapture Batumi. We are holding on, but the Russians are not stopped yet: they have conducted an invasion near Trabson, some 100 km beyond our lines at Batumi! Roads are rare and the main supplyroute goes along the coast. The Russians are planning to cut it off so that an entire Turkish Army wil be cut off at the Batumi front. Our navy lies at ports in Greece, Western and Southern Turkey and at Cyprus, so no large naval help will be at your disposal. However submarines are heading to the area as well as air support and a number of ground forces coming from everywhere. Your forces, that were meant to be for the Batumi front, have to stop the Russian invasion force and drive them back into the sea. Good luck and remember: the attack on Egypt has been delayed because of this situation!
