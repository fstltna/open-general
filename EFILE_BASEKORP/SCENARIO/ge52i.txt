Herr General,  it is your privilege to lead our attack here, south of Novgorod, in the Russian heartland.  A successful offensive here will sever communications between Moscow and Leningrad and trap several Soviet armies. It is, of course, imperative to take your objectives quickly.  Our thoughts are with you.
