Spanish-American War

August 13, 1898

General, since the naval defeat of our fleet by Commodore Dewey's U.S Asiatic Squadron in the waters of Cavite (Manila Bay) on 1 May 1898, Manila has been surrounded both by US vessels and by Aguinaldo's Filipino rebel ground forces. The U.S Army under General Merril has now disembarked and it is moving towards Manila to assault and occupy the city.

As you know, Rear Admiral Cámara's relief squadron has been ordered to return to Spain to face possible U.S. Navy operations against Spain itself. Therefore, do not expect any help from the Metropolis. 

The American commanders, General Merrit and Commodore Dewey, have dared to propose an outrageous agreement to surrender Manila after a "moke" battle consisting in a brief naval bombardment and infantry assault. It goes without saying that a Spanish officer and gentleman cannot accept such a humiliating offer. We count on your sharp fighting to defend the Spanish flag. 

The objective of the defence of Manila is not only a question of honour but also to tie down and divert as many enemy forces as possible to give us a stronger bargaining position at the peace settlement.

Victory conditions: To hold 7 VH for a BV; 5 VH for a V and 3 VH for a TV.
