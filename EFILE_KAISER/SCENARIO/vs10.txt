Antwerp - The First Exit - August 24th 1914

II.Btn. of 24.Reserve Inf.Rgt. that is occupying Impde castle reports that they are attacked by a regiment size Belgian force. This must be either a Belgian reconnaissance in force or the Belgian Army is trying to draw in our reinforcements that we would otherwize be able to commit to two other ongoing big battles:
- the battle of Mons where von Kluck's 1.Armee is clashing with the BEF.
- the battle of the Ardennes where Albrecht von Saxony's 4.Armee and Kronprinz Wilhelm's 5.Armee are fighting the French: Ruffey's 3.Armee and Langle's 4.Armee.

You can deploy 5 ground units and your air unit(s) to help out II.Btn/24.Res.Inf.Rgt. You will be given the opportunity to deploy the rest of your units later in the scenario.
