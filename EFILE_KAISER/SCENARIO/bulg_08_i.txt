Battles of Kukush and Lahna

July 2nd, 1913

I'm glad to see you and your refreshment troops, indeed. This new war hasn't started well for us: Our divisions haven't recovered from the losses that they suffered fighting against the Turks, so right now the Greeks have numerical superiority. They stopped our offensive rather easily, and now they are about to launch a massive counterattack against our lines.
Likely we'll get outflanked east and west from here, in Ser and Dojran Lake, so we'll have to make an orderly retreat to safer positions.
In order to achieve that goal, you and your veteran troops will have to confront and delay the Greek first wave here, between the villages of Kukush and Lahna. The terrain is good for defence and small counterattacks, so you could inflict the enemy heavy casualties. If you do that, we'll be able to retreat undisturbed to the mountains.

Victory conditions: Destroy 15 Greek must-survive units (there are 19 in total). You have 10 turns for a BV, 14 turns for a V, and 18 turns for a TV.
Keep at least one of your VHs.
