Good Morning General
The time has finally come to smash down the walls of "Fortress Europe". Welcome to Operation Overlord. Our part in this Magnum Opus is to estabilish a bridgehead on the beach code named "Juno". This is an 8km wide stretch of beach bordering Saint Aubin, Bernieres, Courselles-sur-Mer and Graye-sur-Mer in occupied France. After clearing the beach, drive as deeply into enemy held territory as possible, capturing all key points of enemy resistance. Good luck General...
