Asian Clash

July, 1967

As you know, commander, our positions near Tuy Hoa are right next to the South Korean troops who are supporting the western invaders. Some of our men, are shortage that exists an operation denominated by the Koreans like ''Hong Kil Dong'', that consists of eliminating our defences in the zone.  We must defend the entire area at all costs, thus avoiding the enemy driving us out of here. However, if you need to retreat some units from the battlefield, there are some underground tunnels ready for your men to avoid annihilation... if needed.

Your current situation near the Ho Chi Minh trail will allow you to request units from the PAVN when you have enough prestige to do it. 

Victory Conditions:

- Hold 4 victory objectives until the end to achieve a Brilliant Victory.
- Hold 3 victory objective until the end to achieve a Victory.
- Hold 2 victory objective until the end to achieve a Tactical Victory.
