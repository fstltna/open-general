General. You and your men fought bravely, but the Bolsheviks stopped our attack. Our tanks have increasing problems in dealing with the Red heavy armor. Unfortunately, Governor Horthy is disappointed and your performance has become an embarrassment to him politically. You are relieved of your command and stripped of your awards. I am sorry, comrade.

The Western borders of Romania were guarded by weaker "training divisions" against a possible Hungarian attack in the fall of 1944. When the Germans and Hungarians did attack in September 1944, these units performed way better than expected, and managed to delay the Axis troops until the arrival of the bulk of the Soviet forces.
 
On September 11, 1944, the 4th SS Division attacked the border posts south of Temesvár (Timisoara), the capital of the Bánát province. It had big strategic importance as a communications hub, and its capture would have allowed the Axis to establish a strong defensive position along the Southern Carpathians.

On September 12, the Hungarian 4th Corps crossed the borders and advanced toward Arad, the Northern gate of the Bánát. The city was captured (liberated, by Hungarian terms) on September 14. On September 15-16, Axis troops tried to seize Temesvár from three sides, but all attacks were repulsed.

By September 18, the Soviet 53th Army and the 18th Tank Corps arrived in the area and routed the desperate Hungarian divisions within two days. The last Hungarian troops retreated from Arad on September 21. The following day the Red Army crossed the border and Hungary became a battlefield for months.
