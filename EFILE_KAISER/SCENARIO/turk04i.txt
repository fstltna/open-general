Battle of Kirk Kilisse - October 22th, 1912

Italy isn't the only country that covets parts of our Empire. Now our former vassals, Serbia, Greece and Bulgaria have made an alliance for seizing our remaining provinces in Europe.
Among all our enemies, the Bulgaria Army is the largest and the most disciplined. They'll attack us in Eastern Thrace, between Edirne and Kirk Kilisse, and they'll try to break our line of defence. They know they have numerical superiority and that, right now, we won't be able to receive any reinforcements, but we can use their overconfidence in our favor.
You'll take command of our right flank and make a quick counterattack in the villages near Kirk Kilisse. If you manage to defeat and outflank the best units of Bulgarian 3rd Army, they'll have to stop their advance or, at the very least, slow their march. That will give us enough time to prepare a solid defence line.
But be careful. Bulgarians are on the offensive west and north of you, so you could clash with them if you advance too quickly.

Orders: Take all VHs.

Special note: There is no possibility to deploy your Hamidiye cruiser, but she will be handy in the next scenario, so you should keep it.
