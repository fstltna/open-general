The First World War - Hundred Days Offensive - early November, 1918 - L

Général, 
Even though you did not reach your objectives, the Germans have signed an armistice! The war is over! 


HISTORICAL EVENTS:
Multiple Entente offensives in September 1918 retook the land in front of the Hindenburg line that was taking by the Germans earlier that year. In October the Hindenburg line was penetrated by attacks of Belgian, British and French forces. 

The Germans had to give up most of Northern France and a substantial part of Flanders, having to abandon increasingly large amounts of heavy equipment and supplies, further reducing their already low morale and capacity to resist.

The armistice took effect at 11:00 on November 11, 1918.

Thank you for playing this campaign that the four of us made between April 2017 and June 2018. You are very welcome to post feedback on JP's Panzers Wargame & History Forums.
