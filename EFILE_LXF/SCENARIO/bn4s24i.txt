
FIRST BATTLE OF GRAMMOS - 18 JUL 1948

Mt Grammos, Pindus Mountains

The battle for the Grammos mountains raged for nearly a month and the Athenian fascists send more and more mercenary troops into battle. We have no choice, we must abandon the Grammos mountains temporarily and dare the breakout! To achieve this, you will carry out a concentrated attack on the center of the enemy forces! Beat a breach in the enemy's ranks and lead our troops in Northeast direction to the Vitsi mountains!

GOAL: Retreat 9 ground units via Exit Points!

STORY: Operation Crown began on 20 June 1948 witn the intent of breaking "the back of the bandit gangs this year". Its objective was to gain complete control of the Grammos Mountain region, the "nerve center of the Communist military forces in Greece." Greek
intelligence sources indicated that the estimated 7,500 guerrillas in the area would defend at all costs.

The operation had three phases. First, GNA forces were to clear areas near the guerrilla main base. When these clearing efforts were complete, the Greek army was then to attack and occupy positions along the DAG's outer defensive line. In the third phase, GNA units were to cut the lines of communication between Grammos and Albania, then conduct a general offensive from all directions against DAG's second defensive line.

Markos, however, knew of the GNA's plans well in advance and reinforced the two defensive lines. In the Epirus region, he kept a 3,000 man force; its mission was to cut the GNA's supply lines once the GNA launched its offensive.

The GNA launched its attack on 20 June. The going was tough and slow--the Greek army was battling over mountainous terrain against a well-prepared defense. Markos's Epirus force harassed the GNA rear areas, forcing the GNA to dedicate units to hunt the raiders.

Nonetheless, Van Fleet determined that the slowness of the operation was due to the incompetence of the "B" Corps commander. On 27 July, Van Fleet recommended that a new corps commander be appointed. The Greek prime minister concurred, but then asked Van Fleet himself to name the new commander Van Fleet, perhaps knowingly accepting the prime minister's challenge, nominated the GGS chief of operations, Lieutenant General Stylianos Kitrilakis. GGS agreed.

On the seventeenth day of Operation Crown, the GNA finally seized the outer defensive line; phase three could at last begin. After twelve more days of hard fighting, Markos ordered a retreat. The overwhelming numbers of the GNA were at last threatening him from both flanks. Some rebels fled to Albania, while the bulk of the rebel force, some 8,000 men, headed towards Vitsi. The GNA's inability to rapidly close a planned pincer movement once again allowed DAG forces to escape.

Despite the slowness of the operation and the escape of the guerrillas, there was much optimism in the US government after Operation Crown. Van Fleet warned, however, that 17,000 rebels remained in Greece. The war was not yet over.

On 21 August Operation Crown officially ended. The GNA left one division in Grammos to prevent guerrilla reoccupation of the area. One reinforced division attacked guerrilla fortifications in the Mourghana region. The next major fight, however, was against DAG forces near Mount Vitsi.
