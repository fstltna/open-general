THE WASTES

Ryburn's Diary - October 5th, 2053

"I never thought I'd see this zone; never hoped I would either.  The contaminants out here have desertified the landscape..."

"Phoenix says the contaminants can't be carried back, that they're not contagious.  That the real problem is in the soil.  I guess we'd better believe him.  But god, I hope he's right."

"The bigger problem right now is reaching the airfield with the equipment we need.  We're in range of Arm aircraft, and there's strange noises we keep hearing out there.  Phoenix said to stay alert, because anything could be living in this area."

NOTES
------------
*Take all hostile victory hexes to win.
*Stick to the roads and the hills if you want to maintain better supply.
