04. ENNS LINE (3 April 1938)

The Enns Line has been successful in holding down the German offensive in the Danube Valley towards Vienna. However at the southern part of the Enns Line, close to the Alps, the commander of the 2nd Infantry Division, Felmarschalleutnant Haselmayr, has been under heavy pressure from German elite units. Due to this, elements are still on the other side of the Enns River and cut off. Even worse, the Germans have directed their 1st Panzer Division, veterans of the Rhineland campaign, to the area and have crossed the Enns River and are very close to breaching the Enns Line. 

Finally the Italians have send forces to support our cause in accord with our treaty. However Mussolini is not willing risk anything with Hitler and the troops are here as volunteers. We do not know the quality of the Italians but any help is welcome. They will be directed to drive the Germans back over the Enns.

Your force is detached from the northern sector and will march south west and join the Italians and our 2nd Infantry Division and you have orders to hold the Enns Line and drive all German forces back over the Enns River!

NOTE: THE ENNS RIVER IS NOT PASSIBLE ON THE ENTIRE LENGTH BUT ONLY ON SEVERAL PLACES.
