General, your handling of the Suvla Bay landing has been one of the worst fiascos in the history of the British army. Even though the Turks were totally outnumbered, they have been able to delay your advance until reinforcements arrived. Their fresh forces pushed us back into the sea. You are instantly relieved of your command and will be send to India for garrison duties on the Afghan border...

HISTORICAL OUTCOME:
While Stopford, the commanding general at Suvla, went to sleep on HMS Jonquil, the landing in pitch darkness ended in great confusion with units becoming mixed and officers unable to locate their position or their objectives. 
In the morning, General Stopford refused to advance without substantial artillery support - giving the Turks enough time to bring two divisions from Bulair to Suvla. General Hamilton, dismayed by the lack of progress and the absence of any drive from Stopford, intervened on 8 August. But precious time had already been lost, and when 32nd Brigade approached the summit of Tekke Tepe on 9 August, they met with strong Turkish reinforcements that virtually annihilated the brigade in a matter of minutes by a bayonet charge.
Hamilton wrote in his diary:
"My heart has grown tough amidst the struggles of the peninsula but the misery of this scene wellnigh broke it... Words are of no use."
