08. CRIMEA CHOICE SCENARIO (15 December 1941)

This is not a regular scenario but a so called 'player choice scenario'. 

For the next scenario, two scenarios can be played. You can choose which one it will be: Kerch of Feodosiya. Both are similar scenarios, both having an amphibious invasion and followed by ground fighting. No matter what your choice will be, after you played the chosen scenario, you will play all scenarios. Your choice won't affect the further continuation of the campaign, nor the scenarios you will play.

So make a choice. Take a regular "Victory" by taking the first hex to play Kerch. Take a "Tactical Victory" by taking the second hex to play Feodosiya.
