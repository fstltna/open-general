At the outbreak of WW1, Australia and New 
Zealand pledged troops to help Mother 
England in her war effort. The convoy left 
Australia and played "Cat & Mouse" with the
German raider Emden across the Indian Ocean.
After sailing thru the Suez Canal they 
received news that there was no
accomadation in England for them and so
they were disembarked in Alexandria.
At this time the Eastern front was in danger
of collapse and Russia on the brink of a 
rout. The Turkish army had invaded thru
Armenia so Russia sent out a plea to her
allies for supplies and a deversionary attack
to relieve the pressure. The supply route to
the Black Sea ran along the Turkish coast up
the Dardanelles and past Constantinople(now
known as Istanbul). Protecting the 
Dardanelle strait the Turks had formidible 
coastal guns which withstood a naval 
bombardment. 
A seabourne invasion was planned to 
neutalize the guns and allow the Royal Navy 
to steam up the straits and attack 
Constantinople thus forcing a Turkish 
surrender. The British Army was almost fully 
committed to the battles in France, so it was
decided to use the Australian and New 
Zealand troops who were training in nearby 
Egypt. These troops were organised into a 
Corp and set sail for the conquest of the 
Gallipoli peninsula and so began the history 
of the ANZACs:
The Australian and New Zealand Army Corp!!!
