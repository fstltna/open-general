The Furher has decided it is vital we take Sweden and have complete control of all the Nordic states. The Finns have found the best route for a fast drive staight to the port of Stockholm. If we capture this port and the airfields rapidly we will be able to force the Swedish government to capitulate.
Unfortunatley, the Swedes have ambushed our Finn allies and we must help them. We have intelligence reports that the Swedes are throwing all their reserves at us. Expect a flanking attack.
