EL AlAMEIN OPERATION SUPERCHARGE November 1942 BV

Our anti-tank screen holding out at the Rahman track and the heroic performance of Ariete have allowed the DAK remnants to retreat. Unfortunately we had to write off most of the non-motorized X (Brescia, Folgore, Pavia) and XXI (Trento, Bologna) Corps. The remnants of your XX Corps are renamed Battlegroup Ariete. 

With strong Allied mobile forces on our tail, the first really defendable position is El Agheila - more than 1000km to the West.
