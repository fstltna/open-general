Attack on Stalingrad
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Now that Sevastopol has fallen our next objective is Stalingrad.  This is an important road and railroad nexus.  Also capture of a city named after the Bolshevik dictator will hurt their morale.  Our intelligence report that there are two tank enemy armies approaching Stalingrad from the north, expect them in our area in a couple of days and make your preparations. This is a critical assignment, Herr General, you must take Stalingrad quickly.


[Confidential Update] Our campaign in Afrika has been halted.  Feldmarschall Rommel's serious illness required his evacuation to the Fatherland for treatment.  He is recovering but will not be able to return to Afrika for some time.  Meanwhile his successors have been unable to continue his advance on the Suez Canal. The continuous loss of convoys to Allied air strikes has undoubtedly contributed to this loss of initiative.
