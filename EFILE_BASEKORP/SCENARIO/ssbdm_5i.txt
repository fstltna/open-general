  "We got 'Em.tell the 'Hood to sail". 
  "Are You apprehensive about this Ilse" Frau SS/KM Admiral Tina asked."It gives Me Nightmares.The Brits on the sea have always been better,that's a fact.Jutland,are We back to Jutland?Of course they've always had the numbers too.I know the Days of ships,especially battleships are numbered with the advancements of the Flyers and Carriers.Soon they will be a liability and not worth even building. 'Frau Biss and 'Frau Tirpz,if We can get them to sea We will be in a lot better position to harras convoys,but that's a few months away.I don't think the 'Pikar Wohr or 'Frau Eni will survive this,if they do it will be a Miracle.I'm hoping those Optics and Range-Finders on board the ships are a class above the Brits.The 'Hood involved though,It is a Mighty ship.Of course did the Brits ever add more Armour to it's structure?I know it was suppose to be up-graded.With a few Shells hitting the right spot maybe We can force the Brits to retreat or maybe chance will let Us 'Cross the T'.If not then Frau Admiral Izzy Zera aboard the 'Wohr and Frau Admiral Puttie Seigerr on the 'Eni will be taking a lot of Our Girls for a Cold swim.Then that Lard-can Prime Minister on that worthless Island will gloat until We knock on His door when We invade.Maybe Our Air Korps will save Us here"?
