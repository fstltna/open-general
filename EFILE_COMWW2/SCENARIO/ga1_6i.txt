Good Morning General
Today we will be pushing on towards Caen. It is imperative to the mission that we capture Carpiquet and its airfield. This will provide us with a forward base from which the attack on Caen can proceed. Bomber command is due to catch up with us in a few days, and will lend it's support in driving the Germans out of the occupied cities. Good luck General...
