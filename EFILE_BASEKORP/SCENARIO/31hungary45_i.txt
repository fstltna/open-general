Herr General,
Our situation in supply of crude oil is critical after losing the Romanian and Hungarian oil fields.
You must occupy the oil field and ready yourself before hard counter attack, because enemy will try obtain these fields at any cost.
The whole of Germany is depending on you. Don't disappoint us.
