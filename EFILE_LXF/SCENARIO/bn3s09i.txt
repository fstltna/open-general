HQ 11th Corps, Province Hupei
CO General Katsuichiro Enbu

General, the GHQ is seeking a faster solution to obtaining a Chinese surrender.  They order you to move directly down the Yangtze River to the relocated Chinese capital, Chongqing.  In order to succeed we need to capture the critical towns in Hubei province, Tsaoyang and I-chang.  Advance south and capture the city of Tsaoyang to prepare our main attack against I-chang.  The enemy will try to cut your forces, so counterattacks are expected, also in your back, but we will provide you with timely reinforcements.

ORDER - Capture & protect all VHs!
AUXIN - 1 Infantry-Brigade
NEW    - 1xTk, 1xRcn, 1xInf (28 core units)
