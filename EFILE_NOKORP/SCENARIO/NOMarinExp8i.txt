Sorry for tearing you from the champagne and the fancy diners, but we have a situation here.
British commando forces have infiltrated Crete and are stirring up the already quite quarrelsome inhabitants: We have a qualified insurrection going on.

Yes, I know, I know, a naval taskforce isn't the best choice for chasing Partisans in the mountains, but due to that infantry division we sent to Port Said, we are terribly short-handed right now. Our troops are stretched too thin.

A piece of advice: Since you are in Berlin and the hero of the day, you should use the opportunity to ask for more troops (or upgrade those you have). Who knows when you'll have the opportunity to do it again.
Do that and come back to your taskforce as quickly as possible: The insurgents are besieging the strategically important city and port of Chania, and you must relieve our garnison there ASAP. The loss of Chania would trigger the general insurrection of the island and we can't afford that right now.


Instructions: Get rid of the British and greek insurgents and capture all VHs.
