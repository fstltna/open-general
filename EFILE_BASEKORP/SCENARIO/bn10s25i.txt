
SARATOV POCKET - 16 JUL 1942

Eastern bank Volga River, Northeast of Saratov, South Russia

The Russians have learned not to repeat their mistakes of '41. North of Saratov they try to escape encirclement and to save at least their mobile forces. Several pontoon bridges were built protected by strong air defense that allow their troops to escape across the Volga to the east. Your order is to destroy these bridges and close this loophole as fast as possible!

GOAL: Destroy 8 of 8 enemy MSU's (pontoon bridges) and prevent the escape of more than 5 enemy ground units via Exit Points!
