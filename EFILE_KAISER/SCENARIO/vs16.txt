At Neuve Chapelle - March 10th 1915

General, now that your old troops have left for the Eastern Front, you have gotten command of [VII] Korps which is part of Crown Prince Ruprecht's 6th Army. Divisions under your command are the 13th and 14th Infanterie Divisions and the Bavarian 6th Reserve Infanterie Division with a young Corporal that is to make history some day.

Three of your battalions are holding a 2km front at Neuve Chapelle - 35km South of Ypres. In front of them are British forces of Sir Douglas Haigh's First British Army. Contrary to the French that keep on attacking in the Champagne area, the Brits have showed rather passive the last few months. They do not seem to share the French idea that the war can be won with 'grignotage and percee' - knibling at the front lines and breaking through.

Your troops have dug in in shallow trenches. The ground here is flat and cut by many small drainage ditches. Behind our lines is the Bois de Biez, with even further back, Aubers Ridge - barely 20 feet higher than the surrounding area but giving an observation advantage.

Player orders: The scenario is 12 turns long. Hold onto 5 hexes for brilliant victory, 4 for victory and 3 for a tactical victory. In case of an enemy attack, the rest of the corps is available to execute a counter attack.
