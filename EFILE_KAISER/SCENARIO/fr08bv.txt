The First World War - The Gallipoli Landings - April 1915 - BV

Général, you have been magnificient! Even those snobbish British generals had to admit that it has been the French Army that has defeated the Turks and taken Krithia. It is a pity that we can't continue our advance to Constantinople and you could enter the Hagia Sophia as a modern-day Napoleon. But the Turkish reinforcements are just too much for our depleted forces. We have to dig in and hold our position for the time being.

HISTORICAL EVENTS:

After the costly setbacks during the initial landings, the allied advance on Krithia was stopped by the Turks on April 28th, and in some places the British and French were even driven back to their starting positions. Another 3,000 allied troops lost their lives on a devastating day that left the infantry men exhausted, demoralized and virtually leaderless due to an appaling breakdown of command. The high hopes for a swift and crushing victory at Gallipoli vanished and the whole campaign turned into trench warfare.
