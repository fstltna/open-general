Narva: German Advisors
February 21, 1918

Major, just recently Estonia has declared her independent status from the crumbling Russian Empire.  At this time, Germany has launched an offensive against Russia to force compliance with the Brest-Litovsk terms.  Germany has agreed to guarantee Estonian independence.

The German have deployed the 439th and 406th regiments of the 205th division.  The 439th regiment (raised from Baltic Germans in Wilna during 1917) is supported by an armored train (Panzerzug) and has the objective to capture Narva.  Use this as an opportunity to learn warfare on rails.  Apart from artillery and assault wagons, regular units may be embarked onto railroad cars for rapid transport (as is the case with the III/439 German battalion).  Armored trains are very powerful units on the battlefield, but they become severely vulnerable when encircled.

The German 406th regiment - a landwehr formation - is tasked with capturing Slantsy.  Intelligence reports that the Bolsheviks have retained control of elements of the experienced 6th Siberian division.  In addition, the Bolsheviks are amassing loyal sailors for a counterstrike from Narva.

Historical note:  Ten years after this battle, the date Feb. 23 was proclaimed to be the official birthday of the Soviet Armed forces.  Dybenko's stunning defeat was masked by the Communist propagandists.
