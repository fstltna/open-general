We have moved your troops into Hungary and it is time for you to lead Operation Waldteufel, the attack to retake Budapest. You must take all of your objectives by March 25th at the latest. However, an earlier completion of your mission is necessary if we are to continue the counteroffensive and drive the Soviets back to Russia.
