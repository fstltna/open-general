14. SLATER'S KNOLL 2 (27 March 1945)

The Japanese activity was not merely meant as diversion. Forward posts have been attacked at Slater's Knoll. Even upstream the Puriata River the Japanese have seem to begin a general counterattack. You must hold Slater's Knoll and the frontline at the Puriata River! Good luck, General!
