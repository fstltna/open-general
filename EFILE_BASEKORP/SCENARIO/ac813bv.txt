General!

Our successful encirclement at Smolensk trapped two full armies!

Your troops screened the flanks of my Panzerkorps so well that the main thrust surged forward at great speed! Your forces on the right fought valiantly against the hordes that pressed in to stop us and stopped them cold!

Bravo to you and your men!
