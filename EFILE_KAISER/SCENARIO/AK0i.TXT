Trentino: Col di Lana - July 4th, 1915

Liebe Anna,

My unit has arrived in the Dolomite mountains, ready to support our Austro-Hungarian allies against the Italians that have betrayed us by declaring war on the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

We have taken positions on and around the Col di Lana - a mountain that dominates the area. I need to go now, but will write again soon. I expect to have plenty of time to do so because the Italians would be crazy to attack in this terrain.

Küsse,
Dein Hugo

ORDERS: Major Hugo Bauernschmitt, The Austrians have not much more then a handfull of local StandSchütz militia and some Gendarmes to defend the mountain passes because most of their mountain units are in Galicia. The newly formed Alpenkorps is the right unit to support them. 

Two and a half additional infantry battalions are preparing to join your forces in a few days.

OBJECTIVES: At the end of the 12th turn, hold all 8 victory hexes for a BV, 5 or more for a V and 2 or more for a TV.
