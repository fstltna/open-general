Amazing work, General! Though we can't win this war, the Bolsheviks are astounded by the success of your offensive against their over-extended forces, and Red Army lost initiative in this region. British will liberate Transdanubia and Hungary will be a democratic country in the future.

As planned, the offensive got under way on March 6, 1945. It was spearheaded by the German 6th SS Panzer Army. Despite the muddy ground conditions, the Germans managed to attack effectively and take the Soviets by surprise. Impressive gains were made for an offensive launched at such a late date in World War II, with some groups penetrating as far as 40 km (25 miles) from the start point.

However, by March 14, Operation Spring Awakening was in serious trouble. The advance of the 6th SS Panzer Army was well short of its ambitious goals. The German 2nd Panzer Army did not do so well south of Lake Balaton as the 6th SS Panzer Army did, north of Lake Balaton. Army Group E met fierce resistance from the Bulgarian 1st Army and ultimately failed to reach its objective of Mohács.

On March 16, the Red Army counterattacked in strength. Within 24 hours of the Soviet counterattack, the Axis troops were driven back to the positions they held before Operation Spring Awakening. On March 22, hopelessly out-numbered and with few armored vehicles remaining, the surviving Axis forces withdrew to prepared positions elsewhere in Hungary. The Soviet counteroffensive continued and these positions were soon overrun.
