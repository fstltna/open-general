Escape from Vung Tau

December, 1964

Well, comrade commander, you have done very well. Nevertheless, at the first light of day our agents in Saigon have reported that the puny so-called ''ARVN'' will sent a large number of troops to clear the Vung-Tau area of our men.

The central office of the Viet-Cong thinks you must undertake an organized withdrawal to safer positions at the jungle. Your men must not be killed or taken prisoner since they must fight another day against the dirty imperialists. It will be at a more adventageous location of our choice. However, I know the central office would also be happy if you are able to show some resistance to the enemy.  This can be accomplished by holding one objective until the end of this mission. One final thing comrade. Our agents have also reported a heli crash near your positions. At least one company of marines have died in the accident, but we are sure that reinforcements will fly over there to recover the corpses.

So, the choice is save all your fighters or hold a position until the end, the decision is yours.

Victory Conditions:

- Hold one victory hex until the end will be considered as a Brilliant Victory.
- Or retreat at least 5 units to fight another day (the red boardered hex is the retreat point).
