Congratulations!

Despite fierce enemy opposition, you have brilliantly delivered supplies to Bayamo. You will be promoted to "Comandante".

A new assignment is waiting for you.

Historical background:

At Peralejo Cubans used for the first time its tactic of cavalry charging at the beginning to force Spanish troops to close up ranks. This allowed Cuban infantry to move into position and to fire into massed squares of Spanish troops. Despite the myth of the "machete" (heavy knife) as Cuban's favourite weapon, in Peralejo, as in many other the battles, the rifle, and not the "machete", was the main weapon. 

It is difficult to consider Peralejo as a victory of any side. The number of casualties on either side was, as usual, in dispute but they were high for both sides, by the standards of the war in Cuba. Estimates of Spanish casualties are 28 killed and 98 wounded, including the death of General Santocildes. The Cubans suffered 118 casualties. However, the Spanish were force to withdraw from the field, something they rarely had to do.

Peralejo was important for a number of reasons. It produced a flood of volunteers to the Cuban Liberation Army, forced Spanish to move in larger columns and allow the revolution to consolidate its hold on east Cuba.
