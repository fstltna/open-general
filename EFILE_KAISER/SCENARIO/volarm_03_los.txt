(...) And step by step, working hard, we made most of those dreams come true. We did it once, and now we'll do it again. This revolution won't defeat us. We may be a little older, but by no means weaker than when we started our story.

Our victory in the Kuban is almost complete. Ekaterinodar is ours at last, and our army is growing. I was wounded in the battle and I couldn't lead the main operations, but don't fear. It's nothing too serious, and in a couple of months I'll be fully recovered.

It won't be long until we can meet again. Hopefully, just a few months. I miss all of you very much, but I must still  be patient. Don't forget to tell Yuri and the girls that his father thinks about them every day. Tell them how we're fighting for our country, and for their future.

Goodbye, dearest Katya, my first and only love...Believe me ever to be your devoted and loving husband,

Sergey
