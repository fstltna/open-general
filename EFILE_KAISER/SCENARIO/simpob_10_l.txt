My troops were too tired to advance fast enough, so when July came we didn't have taken all our objectives. The High Command had to send its reserves, and thanks to them the area of Kazan finally fell under our control.

I was extremely happy. We were recovering our homeland step by step. Siberia and the Urals were safe, and now it was time to consolidate our positions on the Volga.

We had received excellent news from southern Russia, too. Denikin's forces had finally been able to advance into the lower Volga, and had taken Tsaritsyn. That meant that our two armies were separated by less than 150 Russian miles. If we managed to liberate Samara and Saratov, the two main clusters of anti-Bolshevik resistance would finally be united. Kolchak knew the importance of that goal, so he ordered us to plan a summer offensive against Samara.
