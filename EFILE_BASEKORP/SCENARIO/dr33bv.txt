Battle for the Grebbelinie - Brilliant Victory

Herr General! Good work! The Grebbelinie turned out to be defended by ill equiped and badly motivated Dutch troops that were no match for your skills. Utrecht is ready for the capture by 207th ID and SS Regiment Deutschland. 

Your are ordered to take command of your old regiment that is located south of us: SS Regiment Der Fuehrer. Your task is to assist 9th Pz Div in its drive towards The Hague accross the bridges captured by Student's troops. 


HISTORY
- The Grebbelinie: was a defensive line covering the heart of the Netherlands. The line was protected by many flooded areas. The area in front of the Grebbe Mountain at Rhenen was not protected by flooded land, so the Dutch had strengthened the area with more troops, bunkers and artillery than in other parts of the line. 
- May 10th: SS Regiment Deutschland reaches Wageningen in front of the Grebbelinie.
- May 11th: The Regiment captures all outposts.
- May 12th: The Regiment penetrates the main Ducth defensive line. 
- May 13th: A major Dutch counterattack fails and with the help of one infantry regiment of the 207th ID, victory is achieved. The Dutch evacuate the complete Grebbelinie.
