14. TORNIO (1 September 1944)

TO: Grossadmiral
SUBJECT: Counterattack at Tornio

---As Italy betrayed us in 1943, Finland has done so in 1944. They have signed an armistice with the Soviets and are fighting now our German troops still in Finland. The Fuhrer has given order to evacuate Finland and pull our units back to Norway.

The Finns however are not satisfied with our speed and have landed at the Baltic port of Tornio, close to the Finnish-Swedish border. The Kriegsmarine was using this port to evacuate troops and now many of our forces are trapped in Finland. This asks for measures.

The Finnish have send a flotilla of small ships, due to a lack of larger warships, to land and support their invasion force which consists of veterans of the years of Soviet-Finnish wars. The garrison of Tornio is shattered in the countryside. Reinforcements from 20. Gebirgsarmee are underway to limit a Finnish advance inland. Your flotilla will destroy the Finnish Fleet and land the Marine Corps to retake Tornio. Speed is essential. These northern sectors of the Baltic Sea freeze in the winter and the winter is coming. The Kriegsmarine cannot afford the loss of your flotilla.---
