Second Battle of Gaza  - victory

Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) infantry brigades succeeded in entering our trenches at multiple points, but we were able to repulse them with heavy losses on both sides. Well done General.

Historical outcome 
Ottoman forces were able to repulse the weakened EEF troops from the trenches that the EEF infantry brigades took in the initial assaults. British losses were about 6,000 men. Ottoman losses only a third of that. Moral in the Ottoman Fourth Army was high. The EEF dug in and stayed in the trenches opposite Ottoman forces for six months.
