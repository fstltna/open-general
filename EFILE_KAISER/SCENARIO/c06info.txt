BATTLE OF ZADWORZE (17 August 1920)

Comrade, let me quote something for the French socialist newspaper "L'Humanite" from early August.  "Not a man, not a soul, not a shell for reactionary and capitalist Poland. Long live the Russian Revolution!  Long live the Workmen's International!"  As you can see our struggle against the capitalists is not going unnoticed.  The eyes of the socialists all over the world are upon us!

Now back to the battle situation, comrade!  There will be time for rejoicing after our victory is certain!  I know I have been saying this for days but Lwow is now really within our grasp.  We stand some 50 kilometers from Lwow and it appears that there is little between us and the city.  However we cannot take a city, always a very hostile terrain for cavalry, without infantry support and better supply.  Hence, it is vital that we capture the railroad junction of Zadworze.  What the capitalists can gather to resist, I cannot tell. What I can tell is that within days we will be marching into Lwow!
