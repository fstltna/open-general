Orléans

Dec 3rd, 1870

Despite the efforts of the Army of the North and the defenders of Paris, the main threat for the Prussian plans was, without any doubt, the southern Army of the Loire. Commanded by General d'Aurelle de Paladines, on November 9 it had managed to surprise and defeat a Bavarian contingent at Coulmiers. That had been the greatest victory of any French army during the war, and it had allowed them to retake Orléans and to give hope to the Parisians.

Decided to crush that growing menace, Prussia sent reinforcements to the area. On December 3, four German Army Corps, plus some attached divisions, were ready to counterattack and divide the Army of the Loire in two. The French outnumbered the Germans almost three to one, but the Prussian generals believed that their more experienced troops would eventually overcome their enemies.
