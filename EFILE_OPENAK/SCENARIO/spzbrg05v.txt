"Major! Major! Calm down! Maybe I should remind you who's whose boss in this room?!

Now... I understand that you don't want to leave your comrades and that the men of your unit feel the same, but honestly, I don't give a damn about your hurt feelings and even less of those of your tankists. OKH decided that they need you in France, so the rest of our Norway campaign will happen without you... Sit down! Frantsche, komm! Bring us tea! And rum!

So, the decission is yours. Either you may take a rest and in the morning you'll board the plane that takes you home. Or, and now listen very carefully, I may throw you into jail for the rest of night and in the morning I'll send you by the very same plane back to Germany, but this time handcuffed. Choose wisely, Herr Bistroff."

"Welcome home, Herr Major! Oberkommando is very pleased with your results. Follow me, please, there's a work to be done...

I've heard that you've missed the enemy tanks most of the time up there in north. Others weren't that lucky. We've done some tests with captured equipment and we've been very surprised; no need to mention that the surprise was rather unwelcome... This way, please...

Thankfully I'm not one to cudgel my head, but I don't envy your situation. Moreover, because there's not much time for complete rearmament... Up the stairs, please. Go ahead, I'll come up after you. 

So, we very well know of your great experience. We hope that you and other experienced tankmen could find a way to counter the British and French tanks. Sit down, please, I see that we're the first. Good decision that we've gone so early in the morning. That wooden leg of mine is not the best thing that happened to me and I hate when everybody must wait for me to grovel."
