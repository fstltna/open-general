After three days of fighting, during which I was badly wounded by a Dervish spear and nearly died, we finally reached the left shore of the Nile River, where we could send a ship to rescue General Gordon. But all our efforts were in vain, the Dervishes had murdered Gordon and his remaining troops just two days before our steamer arrived in Khartoum. With great sadness in our hearts we returned to Korti and some days later we were back in Egypt, where I could recover from my wound. For the next thirteen years the Dervishes were the true masters of Sudan.

For me, those years were peaceful and happy. I didn't fight in the Ashanti Wars, and I dedicated myself to my family life. I became an avid reader, mainly of military books, but also of British authors, from Stevenson or Conan Doyle to Lord Tennyson or the Cardinal Newman.

My career also improved. In 1890 I was promoted to Major, and six years later to Lieutenant-Colonel. But more importantly, Evelyn and I created a loving and safe home as our family grew; Christine was born in 1886, Thomas in 1889, Margaret in 1890 and finally, ill-fated William in 1893.

My poor William! It's been sixteen years since he died at the Somme, and I still can't write his name without sensing my hands tremble and tears coming to my eyes. His death was the hardest blow that I had to endure as a soldier. But certainly not the first one. I still have nightmares about what happened in 1898, when we went back to Khartoum to crush the Dervishes once and for all.
