Operation Blücher-Yorck - Belleau Wood - June 6, 1918

Operation Blücher-York brought us closer to Paris. But now our attack is checked by US and French forces. Your task is to get us moving again. Success here will bring us to Paris, or at least will draw British reserves away from Flanders. That will give us another chance at swinging around Ypres, reach the Channel Ports and force the British out of the war.
