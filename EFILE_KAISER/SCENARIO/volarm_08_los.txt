My strategy failed. Tsaritsyn would have held, were it not for Wrangel, who took command and managed to conquer the town. Now we're marching along its streets while many peope cheer us. I wonder if they cheered the Bolsheviks before, too. 
In the west, in Ukraine, we've also taken Kharkov. We've found tons of weapons, guns and ammunition, and the number of our soldiers is greater than ever. Now we're truly the Armed Forces of Southern Russia.

Now it's time for thinking on our next move. Against Wranglel's objections, Denikin has decided that we won't try to join Kolchak's forces. Instead, he has ordered an offensive on Moscow. I don't fully agree with him. It's true that if we go in search of Kolchak we could lose the Donbass, the Kuban and the other cossack territories that we control right now. But united we would be stronger. We could defeat the Bolsheviks more easily, and even inflict them a definitive blow. Later, we could always recover the regions that we had to leave behind. 
I fear that if we're divided the Reds will have an advantage on us. We'll have to take more risks and, if anything goes wrong, we could pay a very high price.

Well, there is nothing that I can do. Denikin is in my commander in chief and the decision is made. He's told me that he'll send me to the west in a couple of weeks, but first I must talk to the popes. Anatoly and Olga want to marry in Tsaritsyn in a few days, and I must make some arrangements.
