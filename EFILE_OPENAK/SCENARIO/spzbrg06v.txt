"Ja, Herr General, I was just told that the city is captured and the Dutchmen routed. But we've had great losses. Looks like some scouts reported very badly and many of our troops fell into some sort of trap. And in the chaos that reigned there, our pilots even bombed several of our units. Yes, yes, I know, very frustrating, but this just happens. Nein, mein Herr, I won't tell this to the survivors... Pardon? Oh, the name of the officer that saved the situation? I really don't know, but I'll do my best to find him out!"
