Port Said

Aug 16th, 1919

Here we are, at the gates of Egypt. Just one year ago the Ottoman Empire nearly collapsed, after losing all of Arabia, Mesopotamia, Palestine and Syria under the British pressure. But then, when everything seemed lost to them, our offensives in Greece and Italy forced the British to retire most of their troops in the Middle East. They achieved nothing, but that decision allowed the Turkish to counterattack and, with the help of some Austrian and German units, they managed to recover most of the lost ground, including the Sinai.

That gives us a great opportunity to attack the Sueskanal. If we block British ships from crossing the kanal, keeping control over India will become an impossible task and the Empire  will be lost. Before that happens the British will finally sign a peace treaty. So,  Feldmarschall, your mission will be to assault the Sueskanal and take Port Said and Damietta.

Your arrival has been kept a secret, so you'll be able to surprise the Australian divisions that guard the area. Yesterday our sturmtruppen took strategical positions on the eastern shore of the kanal, paving the way for your final attack. Go,  Feldmarschall, and good luck. This could be the last battle of this war.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.

Special note: Once you take Port Said your ships will be able to reach the ports of El Matariya and Damietta.
