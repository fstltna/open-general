After their failure at Núi Bop the French considered retreating from the Luc Nam valley, although they finally rejected the idea. They couldn't afford being humiliated by the "yellow savages", so they sent even more reinforcements to the area, determined to take Lang Son once and for all.

For our part, this victory didn't alleviate our supply problems, and knowing that the final battle for Lang Son was imminent we left Núi Bop and marched to the north, where the roads were better. It was a risky decision, but it was our only alternative.
