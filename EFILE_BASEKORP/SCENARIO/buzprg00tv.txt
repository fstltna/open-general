So, your mission, the "Battle of Buzuluk" is over. Hopefully your result wasn't too dissapointing.

At first, there wasn't enough equipment and weaponry for the Czechoslovaks. Soldiers wore civilian clothes and trained with wooden rifles and make-believe artillery for a very long time and it was only in the end of November 1942, when the final cargo of necessary stuff reached Buzuluk. 

They were also indoctrined by communist propaganda and this led to many frictions and even open hostilities - like the one that happened when Klement Gottwald, head of Czechoslovak communists in Soviet exile was told to "shut up" while he held a speech during his visit of Buzuluk.

You may leave the camp now and start your real campaign FROM BUZULUK TO PRAGUE!
