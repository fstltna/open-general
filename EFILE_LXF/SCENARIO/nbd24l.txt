Commander, it is not a pleasure to meet with you on this occasion. Your tragic loss to an already beaten and demoralized foe has made the United States Army a laughing stock in the World Press. Even worse, a Japanese counterattack has recaptured the island that was your objective and your troops, what few survived, were mostly eaten by the natives. Your actions were not only incompetent but treasonous. Be prepared for a nice long confinement at Leavenworth, following a "fair" trial of course.
