AC 073 Battle at Vesuvius (Schlacht am Vesus)

Spartacus - Months have passed and your followers entreched at Vesuvius. Gaius Claudius Glaber by now received the order to put down the rebellion.
Spartacus ! Now it's your turn to avert this threat. The first real battle is to win !

Historical:
Propraetor C. Claudius Glaber drove with 3000 recruits Spartacus and his bunch before him, up to Mount Vesuvius, where he wanted to starve out the slaves. Spartacus was not discouraged, raided one night foolhardy the besiegers, who thought they were safe, and put them to flight.
The arrogant error of Glaudius Glaber, to dispense the usual fortification with wooden palisades, retaliated strongly. The frightened recruits fled and Glaber barely escaped. This sensational victory not only caused more slaves, but also impoverished farmers, farm workers and adventurers to join Spartacus.
