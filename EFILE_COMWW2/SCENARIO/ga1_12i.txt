Good day General
Your men, along with elements of the 8th British army , have been ordered to join the Fifth U.S. Army in the drive for Rome. You must break the German defenses from Cassino to the Tyrrhenian Sea and advance up the Liri valley. Reconnaisnace of the area reports that the rivers are still swollen and raging from the spring rains, so capturing and using the existing bridges will be imperative to your success in this mission. Good luck General....
