Second Battle of Gaza - April 19th, 1917

The British Army completed the capture of the Sinai in February. In March they moved into Palestine and attempted to take Gaza but failed.

With the railway extended to Deir el Belah, they were able to bring in more artillery and tried again. Your task is nothing more than to prevent them taking Gaza.

Orders: 
- At the end of the scenario, holding 7 victory hexes gives you a brilliant victory. Hold 5 for victory and 3 for a tactical victory.
