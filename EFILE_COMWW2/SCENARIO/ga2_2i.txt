Herr General, the Fuhrer has had a sudden change of mind! You are to now abandon the drive for Kiev and instead move south east towards Bila Cerkva, a strong point on the Stalin Line. Capture all objectives and the encirclement  of two Soviet armies and part of a third in the Uman area will  soon be complete!
