Operation Perch v1.2

At the 6th june 1944 the operation "Perch" starts, with the goal to take the city of Villers-Bocage. Nobody calculated with a Tiger commander of the 101st heavy SS-tank division. When Michael Wittmann at june 13th spotted a english military convoi outside the city, he rapidly attacked the enemy with 5 Tigers and almost annihilated a whole brigade of the 7th TD "Desert Rats".

Is it possible to stopp him or will he cause even more damage???
