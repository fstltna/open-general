Canada is big enough to stage a Deep Defence right out of the manual. It will be a long war, but not for you. We have other plans for your naval force.

One last task avaits you though: Since you're already there, you will capture us the city of Montreal which is a little further up the St. Lawrence. Our land troops will take it from there.

Unfortunately up there the St. Lawrence river isn't deep enough for your big ships and your aircraft carriers. But now you have enough land troops and can capture and hold conventional airports so this shouldn't be a problem.


Instructions: Capture all VHs. You won't be able to deploy all your ships due to the shallow depth of the river. Deploy your planes on a conventional airfield.
