Tutorial Scenario Lupo 3 

Commander, 
the capitalists caused an uprising in Leningrad with false propaganda and large infiltration forces. 
We must restore order within hours. 
It's key to retake all operational airports and the enemy HQ, beware we sent a tank regiment to attract most enemy forces so expect though resistance in the south but also expect some surprise at other objectives, they seem to have restored some old equipment from our depots, especially fighters and a few small ship.

We've sent our finest pilots to assist but this a one way only trip for them, so be sure to grant them a landing before they run out of fuel.

Our fleet should be able to assist in the assault and deal with the few ships they stole.

good luck
