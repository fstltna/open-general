20. HEL (9 September 1939)

TO: Korvettenkapitaen
SUBJECT: Submission of Hel

---While the German armies rumble across the Polish planes towards Warsaw, the Baltic coastline is still not secured and under German control. Westerplatte and Danzig are ours again but Polish troops still hold out near Gotenhafen and the peninsula fortress of Hel.

The Army has send the 207. Infanterie Division to clear the area around Gotenhafen. The Marinekorps has been ordered to capture Hel. Fortress Hell has several light and heavy coastal artillery batteries so be careful when approaching it. However, this operation will show to the Fuehrer how useful and effective the Marinekorps really is! Luckily the old battleship KM Schlesien has been attached to your flotilla for additional fire support.---
