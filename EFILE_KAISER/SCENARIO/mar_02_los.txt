Message from General Fernández Silvestre's HQ:

General, after your past victories near Melilla I really did expect more of you and your men. You have lost a very important town. No matter if we recover Alcazarquivir in a few weeks, our military prestige is seriously damaged. Now more and more men will join El Raisuli's harkas and our task here has become more difficult.

I don't forget your past services to our fatherland, but you must leave Morocco immediately. The war is over for you. I'll make sure that you are sent to a bureaucratic position in some Spanish province.
