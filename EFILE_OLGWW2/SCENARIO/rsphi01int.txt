Lingayen Gulf

December, 1941

Konichiwa General. I just want to wish you good luck for this new mission. The puny occidentals have held these islands for too long, and now we are going to clean another Asian place more from the foreign presence.

I have visited the Philippines in the past, and I can say the Lingayen Gulf offers good beachs to disembark your troops, select carefully where you are going to deploy your men, and the victory will be easy and swift. Also, I should say the high command has decided to land some of your troops nothwards from here, so, some of your command will come from the North.

Kitto-Katsu General!.
