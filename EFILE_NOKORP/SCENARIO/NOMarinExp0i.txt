Commander you have the honor to lead our new amphibious assault force! Your first mission is easy:
We need to keep the sea routes to our iron supply in Norway clear. Now it happens the Britsh have installed a small naval base at Karlsund that will be a thorn in our side. You will take out this annoying naval base hidden near the Swedish coast.

But first you need to neutralize the radar installation on the peninsula of Mariestad. This will allow our fleet to move unnoticed.
It's an easy task, the peninsula is barely defended, and since it lacks any protected harbor, there won't be any ships stationed there. It's a walk in the park and a great opportunity to test the training of your men. Don't tire your troops too much though, you won't have the time to rest them before Karlsund, where they should be in perfect fighting condition: Karlsund will be a tough fight.

One last word: Be careful with your carriers, commander. We definitely can't afford to lose them. Given the time it takes to build one, if we lose any of them, we lose every chance to control the seas for the years to come. The enemy knows it and will certainly try to do his worst. You have been warned.



Instructions: Occupy all VHs and neutralize all enemy forces present.
Check your ships, they all have specialties. For instance, "Küstennebel" is carrying 210 mm Nebelwerfer artillery and will allow you to soften up enemy coastal defenses before assault.
Caveats: Don't let any of your two carriers get destroyed. (And better don't lose any of your two Marine companies, they're unique and you'l miss them dearly later on.)
