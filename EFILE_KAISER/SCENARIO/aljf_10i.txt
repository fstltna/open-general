August, 28., 1862 Retreat at Bull Run


Dear Friend,
General Lee fought his way trough all our armies and stands now close to Washington....but more bad news: the enemy uses our famous strategy and flanks us.... we must draw back to better positions.... 
An orderly retreat...: one of the most difficult manuveurs...


ORDERS:
General, an enemy army, coming from the South !.... If we hold the actual positions, our Army, Washington and maybe the whole war is lost !....we must draw back and build a defense line on better positions...

HOLD ALL THE VH !

NOTE: In this Scenario "Skip first Player Turn" is activated : The Confederates starts...

ADVICE FROM YOUR OLDEST SERGEANT:
Dont forget: we must hold ALL VH's !
