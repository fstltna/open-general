Very good, commander. Task accomplished, despite the presence of a much greater force than expected. Could it be the enemy has broken our secret communication codes? Anyway, your main task is now wthin reach: The bay of Karlsund and its naval base.

Your men are a little worn out, but unfortunately we don't have the time for R&R: The attack window is very small and time is very important. We will try to keep you supplied, do your best.
