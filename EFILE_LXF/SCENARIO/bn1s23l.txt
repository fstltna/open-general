General Kurt Student

Our plan has worked! Your Paratrooper Forces are destroyed, but we could agree an armistice with the Russians. After so many long years, the war in the east is finally coming to an end. You and your paratroopers have been selected to lead the peace parade in Berlin. Good job, General!

Thanks for playing the GREEN DEVILS! I hope you enjoyed the campaign and maybe we will see each other again here, or in another of my campaigns.
