Although we have been defeated, the liberal army withdrew. They lost General Concha, who was killed by one of our shots. Although an enemy, he was a capable and courageous man. We will pray for him.
But the enemy will come again. The republican army outnumbers us. We can only hope for a miracle and that the political situation in Spain changes favorably to our interests.
