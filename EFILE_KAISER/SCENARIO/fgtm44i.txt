Brusilov Offensive:  The Kowel Operation
22nd July, 1916

Gospodin General, heavy rains hamper our communications, and the advancing front's support is not able to keep up.  Brusilov has gathered the remaining forces assaulting Kowel into an ad-hoc Osobaya (Special) Army.

Germany has responded to Austria's plea for help and began transferring divisions from the west to stop us.  You must carry the momentum forward and dash the Prussians' hopes of aiding their ally.
