07. RURI (9 May 1945)

The time has come to advance across the Bonis peninsula to cut off Japanese troops on the peninsula and prevent communications with the Japanese concentrations at Numa Numa and on southern Bougainville. For this advance you have been ordered to capture the village of Ruri on the eastern side of the base of the peninsula. Patrols are indicating that Japanese opposition is getting more tenious. Good luck, General!
