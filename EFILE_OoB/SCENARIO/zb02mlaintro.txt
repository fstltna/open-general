Battle of Mlawa 

Herr Hauptmann, your new posting is to the operations staff of General der Artillerie von Küchler's Third Army in East Prussia in preparation for Fall Weiss.
....

This past summer the Poles have been busy at work constructing a line of blockhouses just across the frontier at Mlawa; it is no Westwall however, and beyond that is open countryside, perfect terrain for our panzers! 

[Note: You can trade in your Italian hire car from Spain for a nice new German Kübelwagen (VW Typ 82) via the upgrade panel.]
