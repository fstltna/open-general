Welcome Herr General
To prevent a British naval blockade we will seize the Norwegian coast before the Allies can. The invasion of Denmark and Norway will consist of several task forces heading for specific ports. Your task force, Gruppe 1, will head for the northern Norwegian port of Narvik. 

The Norwegian Navy will not be much of a problem. However an British flotilla has been sighted and will likely engage your units, so speed is of highest importance.

Good luck, Herr General.
