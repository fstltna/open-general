Congratulations, Herr General, an outstanding performance. Our Finnish allies want to retake their lost territory from the Bolsheviks.  Because of your brilliant performance helping them as a 'volunteer' in 1939, they have asked for you to lead their attack.  We have decided to grant their request, so Feldmarschall Paulus's forces will now take over and capture Stalingrad.
