
SEDAN - 13 MAY 1940

After months of sitting idle, the German Army has gained the iniative and started its offensive in the West! The enemy has attacked on a broad front from the Netherlands to the Ardennes: just as expected. We will conduct our Dyle-plan. Some of our Armies, including the British Expeditionary Force, will move into Belgium to prevent the war from reaching French soil. Meanwhile the Maginot Line will defend Alsace and Lorraine. Our 9th and 2nd Armies, you part of the latter, will defend the area in between: the Ardennes sector.

French cavalry and Belgian troops have reported German troops moving through the Ardennes towards the Meuse River. Most likely they will attack somewhere. The 55e Division d'Infanterie will defend Sedan. You will defend the Meuse south of Sedan. Whatever the enemy is up to, you have orders not to let him cross the Meuse. It is unlikely that the Germans will be able to do this without heavy artillery support but we can take no risks. 

Defend the Meuse River! Vive la France!

GOAL: Hold 3/2/1 VH's for a BV/V/TV!

NOTE: Buy an air defense weapon!
