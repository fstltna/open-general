Port Novorossiysk, West Caucasus
CO General Vittorio Ambrosio

General, it seems so, we have the Russian underestimated! They have launched an Airborne Assault on the Port of Novorossiysk. At the same time a massive attack at our South-West Caucasus Front take place to link up with their airborne troops. Your Italian Corps must protect the Port and annihilate the Russian Airborne troops!
