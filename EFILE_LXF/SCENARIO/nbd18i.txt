Faced by the impossibilty of wresting control of Guadalcanal from our forces, 
the Japanese have sprung a surprise on us. A special landing force 
designated the Solomons Assault Group have landed on Rennell Island 
and captured the key cities of Vinegau and Tuhungganggo and are awaiting 
reinforcement.  Last night, the Tokyo express landed heavy reinforcements on 
the far side of the Island.  These units make up the elite "Kosshoku Guards 
Armored Division."  Their leader, the feared General Kosshoku, is well 
noted for his brutality. Some survivors of the assault have made their way to 
the coastwatcher station down the beach from Vinegau. It is imperative that 
these survivors be saved. If the armored column manages to get over the 
Vinegau Bridge, there will be no way to save them.

Your mission is to destroy the bridge at Vinegau and the Kosshoku Detachment when it arrives. The bridge is heavily defended by AA so an air assault or bombers is not recommended.
