Herr General! The Piedmontese army started to blockade the fortress of Peschiera about a month ago. The besieged fortress suffered heavy bombardment and it is almost out of ammunition and food. The Papal forces aren’t eager to fight and the defeated and disillusioned Tuscan volunteers returned home. Now you have a good chance to break through the Piedmontese defense lines at the River Mincio and send your troops north to relieve Peschiera.
