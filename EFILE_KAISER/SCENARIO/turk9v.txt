Dardanelles, April 25th 1915 - BV

Congratulations! British and French troops are trapped in small areas without any possibility of further advance. They will be forced to re-imbark sooner or later. You have done a very good job!

Historical outcome: After the initial landings, not much advantage was taken of the situation and most troops stayed on the beaches. The Turks had time to bring up reinforcements. The subsequent failure of the Entente's offensives, the persistent lack of progress, and the entry of Bulgaria into the war on the side of the Central Powers opening a second Mediterranean front at Salonika, made the Entente's position untenable and forced the evacuation of the peninsula.
