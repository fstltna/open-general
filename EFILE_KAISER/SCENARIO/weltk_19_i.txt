To the Marne!

Mar 2nd, 1919

The time has come. During all of these months, after our victories in Eastern Europe and Italy, we've been preparing ourselves for this. Our Great Spring Offensive against France, the Kaiserschlacht. We've gathered everything we have: men, weapons, ammunition, everything. This time we have a large and mobile reserve ready to attack as soon as you open a gap in the enemy lines.

We've chosen the area of Saint-Mihiel to launch our main attack. Although the French have had time to establish a strong defence in depth, when you overcome their positions it'll be hard for them to stop you before you reach the Marne, because their mobile reserve is quite weak. Once the Eastern bank of the Marne is secured we'll be able to encircle the defenders of Nancy and Verdun, and we could even threaten Paris.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.
