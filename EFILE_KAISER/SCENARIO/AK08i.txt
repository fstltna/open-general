Flandern - April 25th, 1918

Dearest Anna,

Everyday I wake up thinking that this time, with one final push, our enemies will be routed, the way to Paris will be open, and this war will end at last. I can almost feel it. We are so close... one last, bold effort and all our sacrifices will have a reward. We just have to try a little harder, a little longer, and we’ll make it.

At least, that’s what I hope. Maybe when the spring ends we’ll be able to be together again. Forever.

Love you,

Hugo.

ORDERS: Herr Oberst, your orders are clear: your men must assault the French defences at Kemmelberg and open a gap in the Entente lines, one that we can exploit to capture the Channel ports and encircle Paris. The outcome of this war may depend on you. Good luck!

OBJECTIVES: Take all VHs.

INTELLIGENCE REPORT: Beware of the enemy artillery batteries.
