Brief to Anzac Commander.

Jerusalem has been under Muslim rule for centuries and the High Command strongly desires it's 'Liberation'. This will provide a great morale boost to our troops and Allies. Your objectives are Jerusalem and it's airstrip, The city of Jaffa in the north with it's airstrip and the railway station at Lydda.
