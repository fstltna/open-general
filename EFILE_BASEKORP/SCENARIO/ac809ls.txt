General!

I have just had the most humiliating meeting with Hitler!

I had to suffer his tantrums about giving the Yugoslavs advanced notice of the invasion and then his tirades about Italia's pathetic troops that can't seem to deal with the miserable token resistance that the Yugoslavs produced.

You are stripped of all titles and property, the 4th CCNN awaits you, volunteer, now get out of my sight!
