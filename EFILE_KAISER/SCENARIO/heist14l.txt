Kindralmajor,

Your raid on Krasnaya Gorka has turned out to be a resounding failure.  No mutineers have been rescued, and your troops suffered heavy casualties.  Nonetheless, the Red Army has received a tactical shock, and we must carry this momentum forward into the upcoming offensive, Kindralmajor.
