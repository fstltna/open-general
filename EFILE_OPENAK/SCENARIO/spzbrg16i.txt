Algerian Borders

Part 2/3 of the "Afrika" minicampaign


"Herr Generalmajor, as you already know, the Anglo-American forces captured Algeria and hence Tunisia is under a direct threat of an invasion. High Command decided to send your brigade westwards and hold the enemy advance towards the capital.

The American units are well equipped, however they lack any significant combat experiences. I order you to smash them into nothingness. After you make harmless the most immediate threat, you'll recapture Algeria in a series of fast operations with the final goal being a total control over North-West Africa. No other result is possible!"


Victory condition: Capture all VHs.

Hint: We have a huge air dominance over the region, as the enemy airplanes must fly from a distant airfields. Americans once again launched an amphibious operation and there were even the gliders spotted above the sea, but most of their units comes from the west, where they broke through our lines. Their British and French allies are in the southwest and their advance guards already crossed the rivette.

With our superior equipment we are able to repel the enemy, but take care of traps and anything unexpected!

Warning: This scenario uses a bit limited deployment, use the "View the Strategic Map" feature first!
