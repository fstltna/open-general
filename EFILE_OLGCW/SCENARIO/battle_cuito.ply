The FAPLA, the armed wing of the angolan MPLA, the people's party for the liberation of Angola, has launched a strike on the UNITA (the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, supported by South Africa) positions near the village of Mavinga, in the South-Eastern Angola. However, the intervention of the South African Defense Force became too much for the FAPLA, and soon, the angolan communists found themselves into a desperate withdrawal to seek secure positions behind the Cuito river.

However, Castro has promised to the angolan movement to increase the current support they are receiving from Cuba. Indeed, a cuban general, Ochoa Sanchez, is managing the operations, and the cubans are preparing some more than sole advisors to be sent to the battlefield. Can the FAPLA/Cuba forces turn the tide?.
