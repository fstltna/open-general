Part of Battle of Nanchang
(Japanese victory)
Mid-February - Early May 1939

HQ 11th Corps, Province Hupei
CO General Neiji Okamura

General, your occupation of the important railway centre of Nanchang obviously does not sit at all well with the Chinese.  They have started a strong counter offensive!  Presently all of our troops are committed to other fronts so no reinforcements are available.  You must intercept the attack alone.  Under no circumstances are you to relinquish Nanchang!  We are counting on you!

ORDER - Capture & protect all VHs!
AUXIN - 7 Battalions (4 late)
NEW    - 1xInf, 1xTB (21 core units)
