General,

Your troops really deserve to be considered as the elite of the Belgian army!

All German attacks have been repelled and you have retreated the forces under your command in an ordered manner. Your defence has enabled our army to safely take positions on the "Ligne KW" (Dyle line).

A new mission is waiting for you.

Le Chef d'Etat-major général de l’armée (EMGA).

Historical note

During the 12th and 13th of May the temporary line at the Gete River was heavily attacked by the German infantry at Halen, Geetbets and Goetsenhoeven. All attacks (in total eleven) were repelled and the Belgian cavalry divisions only retreated when they discovered that the French on their left had already retreated. This defence enabled also the BEF to take positions on the "Ligne KW" (Dyle line) without being attacked by the Germans

In most cases the retreat of the Belgian army towards the Dyle River succeeded without too much difficulty but for some divisions it was a very hazardous undertaking (e.g. the evacuation of the 3rd and 2nd division from Liege (Luik) or the encirclement of the 14th division at Lummen).
