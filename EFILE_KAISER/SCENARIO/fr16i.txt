The First World War - Spring Offensive - Battle of the Lys- Mont Kemmel (Kemmelberg)- Apr 25th, 1918

Fabienne, ma chère épouse,

I've just read your last letter. It has saddened me deeply how much the news that you read in the papers have affected you. Calm down, I beg you. I can assure that we have motives to be optimistic, despite what the journalists say.

Now that the Americans have deployed their forces, the war is won. It may take some months, or even one year, and, sadly, many people will lose their lives before the end, but the fact is that there is nothing that the Germans can do to defeat us. No matter if they are magnificent soldiers. No matter that they've already defeated Russia. They lack the resources to win the war in the Western Front. Sooner than you think, they'll be suing for peace.

I admit that now that they're wounded and desperate they've become extremely dangerous, as any other cornered wild beast. But if we have patience and don't lose our minds, we'll overcome this last German offensive. Once that it is over, everything will be better. Have faith, Fabienne, the worst months of the war have already passed by. Verdun and Chemin des Dames were the hardest times. Now I'm starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel. We just have to resist a little longer.

I'll see you again very soon. I promise you that. I'll retire fron the Army and we'll spend the last years of our lives together, in the countryside, receiving the visits of our grandchildren. I pray for long, happy and peaceful years by your side. And now I know that they'll come soon.

I love you,

Jean-Babtiste.
