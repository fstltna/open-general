Gospodin General-Leitenant, your daring raid across the Niemen River has been a stunning success!  Throwing the German Landwehr units back into the waters, you have forced the enemy to commit his reserves to push toward Wilna.  Your action has bought valuable time for our defenders, as they prepare for the German assault.
