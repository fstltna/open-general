Ah General!

Your attack impaled itself on the communists, as we speak our forces retire to regroup and survive the winter.

We have missed a great opportunity to end this war.  

Mussilini has thankfully promised me more troops under General Graziani.  You, I understand, are to report immediately back to him...............and a lot of Italian mothers...
