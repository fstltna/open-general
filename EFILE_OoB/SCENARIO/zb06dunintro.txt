Dunkirk

The Haltbefehl has been lifted! We are again free to drive the enemy into the sea!  

[Important note: Following turn six all units from 1.Pz, 2.Pz, 3.Pz, 6.Pz, 8.Pz, 10.Pz, 29(mot.) and SS-VT divisions will disappear from gameplay; prior to this however, 9.Pz and 20(mot.) divisions will arrive to begin filling their places on the line. (In 1940 those divisions were withdrawn at that moment in preparation of Fall Rott - the conquest of France.)] 

[Designer note: This scenario features only the units engaged in attack/defense of the Dunkirk perimeter; there were additional German and French units in the map area covered on the bottom right (e.g. 7.Pz, French 4eDI, etc.); these French forces were cut off and driven into a second, separate pocket at Lille (just off the map) - this pocket surrendered May 31st. 

(Belgian forces capitulated May 28th.)]
