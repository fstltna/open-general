Choice

Now you must choose which path you will follow for the next two scenarios:

If you take the British flag, you will keep on fighting against the main British forces in the center of the colony, first in Kondoa and next in Kisaki.

If you take the Belgian flag, you will face a Belgian invasion of Tabora in the west and then you will meet the British again in Narungombe in the south.

If you take the Portuguese flag, you will go south and will fight against the Portuguese in Nevala and then against the British in Kibata.
