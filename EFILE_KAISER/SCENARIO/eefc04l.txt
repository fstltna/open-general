LOSS
-----------------------------
What a disaster, General! Even though the Turks were not able to overcome our positions, your failure to defeat them has left them in a very strong position. Our casualites have been servere, and we are expecting another offensive by Johnny Turk in the near future.

But this may not concern you anymore. ..

 I must inform you that you have been instantly relieved of your command. You are called back to London to give a full report of this operation. The Prime Minister has called you an "example of unbearable military incompetence", so don't expect to see further action in this war...
