You did the impossible, Citoyen General! You stopped the imperials! The Austrians are tired of the war and unable to cope with long supply lines. The defenders of Komárom have inflicted a terrible loss upon them. The court in Vienna is also worrying about the success of the Russian army. This situation is forcing the young Franz Joseph to negotiate a peace settlement. I’m afraid we should forget the complete separation and made a compromise to keep at least our internal independence. Perhaps the NDC should have chosen another General to command our army...

Thanks for playing my campaign!
