Operation Luettich - August 1944 L

American forces are moving fast through the gap that you failed to close near Avranches. The US VII and XV corps are moving East to the South of us, threatening to surround us now that the Brits have broken through North-East of us near Caen. Retreat East towards Falaise to save your troops.
