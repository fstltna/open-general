Inverness

Orders:

Most of Great Britain is under controll. Now we push further north. Inverness is the key to the Highlands. You need to take the city and the surrounding area. Intel reports only few enemy units in this area. Our ships did not make it in time as the way around the northern tip of Great Britain is much to long.
