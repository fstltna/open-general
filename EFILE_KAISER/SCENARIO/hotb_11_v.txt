The German and Austrian defenders have been completely destroyed by our combined attacks. The coordinated use of artillery, tanks, infantry and planes has been devastating, and I'm sure that's the way the wars of the future will be fought. We've taken almost 15,000 German prisoners, hundreds of guns and tons of ammunition. Even though the Krauts were already planning their retreat from the salient, our attack took them completely by surprise. What a fine victory! 

With each successful battle our allies respect us more and more, so now they count on us to strike the final blow to the Hindenburg Line. We won't let them down, will we?
