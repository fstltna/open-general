BACKGROUND

Knin operation in 1944 was launched by Yugoslav Partisans 8th Corps from 7 November to 9 December 1944 with purpose of destroying German, Ustasha and Chetnik formations in the area of Knin. It is often refereed to as much larger Partisans offensive which liberated most of Dalmatia covering all operations from Zadar to Dubrovnik.

After difficult withdrawal from Dalmatian coastal areas during operation HERBSTGEWITTER (1944), headquarters of German 15th Mountain Corps (which was based in Knin until 19 November when it moved to Ostrozac near Bihac transferring defense of Knin to commander of the 264th Division) was ordered to hold Knin at all costs. German units were ordered to defend Knin to the last round and to the last men in order to stop advance of 8th Corps towards Lika and Bosnia. Knin was strategic point in defensive plans of German high command as part of the line going from Srymia over Sarajevo and Mostar holding the end of that line.
