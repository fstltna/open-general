Excellent! Outstanding!

You have officially won, mastering the "Get'Em" challenge brilliantly. I do hope you had some fun breaking free from any historical constraints and simply had fun.

If you want, you can play that last scenario again: Click to end this scenario, and you'll be presented with a black choice screen with flags: There you can chose to either leave well enough alone (and claim your victory), or to play the Boss scenario again.
Or even a more difficult version of it...
