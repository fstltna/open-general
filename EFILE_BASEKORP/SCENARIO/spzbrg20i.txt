Zitadelle in Ruins

Part 3/4 of the "Zurueck in USSR" minicampaign.


"It's over, gentlemen. Since I've got the news of my promotion, I knew that we're in serious trouble. But now it's official. Nevermind. We were in a wish-wash times before and we may still save the brigade. But it will cost many lives; not everyone makes it to the safety. I want you to immediatelly start with organization of the withdrawal. We must hold the bridges as long as possible, lest they all will be trapped.



Victory conditions: After 12 turns hold five VHs for a BV, three for a V and two for a TV.

Hint: The Soviets have overwhelming superiority. You can't do more than hold the lines for the time ordered. Soviet units are strong, experienced and omnipresent.
