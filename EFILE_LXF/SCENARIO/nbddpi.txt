You have been assigned as the reserve force for an allied landing at Dieppe. British and Canadian planners have asked if we would participate and we agreed out of political concerns. Make no mistake, the Joint Chiefs regard this mission as suicidal and on their own would never approve such an operation. That is why you have been chosen for this task, your units are the only ones that the high command considers expendible.  

As expected, the mission is not going well and the allied troops are facing annihilation. The coastal batteries that were the intended target are still in operation. You will land your troops and complete the mission assigned. The batteries must be destroyed and then we will try to evacuate any survivors. If you do not succeed?  Well, death or a POW camp are the most obvious choices.
