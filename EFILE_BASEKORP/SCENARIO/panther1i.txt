Relief of Kholm (5 May 1942)
Second part of the "Blitzkrieg!" minicampaign.

STRATEGIC SITUATION:
With the success of Soviet winter counter-offensive, many Axis units were trapped in cauldrons.  In January 1942, German troops in Kholm were surrounded by Soviets in one such a pocket.

TACTICAL ORDERS:
Soon after acquiring fresh new Panzer II tanks, your battalion was ordered to attack the Soviet positions east of Kholm. Our men still hold the town, but they are in a desperate situation. Airdropped supplies are running low, as many of the JU 52 transport planes were shot down by the enemy. You need to act quickly, and completely dismantle the enemy. Destroy the Soviets east of the city, thus cutting off their frontline units in Kholm and its vicinity by severing their supply lines, then secure the eastern approaches so that a save evacuation is possible.

RECONNAISSANCE:
Soviet forces consist of two battlegroups. The main force holds the outer lines east of Kholm, and it is your task to destroy them and thus facilitate liberation of the cauldron. These are formed of infantry with some light artillery and AA support. The second, smaller group, is assaulting the town, and they are supported by light tanks and infantry guns. Destroy their rear before they overcome the defenders of Kholm.

NOTE:
There are enough planes already grounded, don't waste the air support needlessly.

VICTORY CONDITIONS:
