Perfect, just as planned. We'll assault Bukarest before the enemy defences are ready. The Romanian army will have to surrender or, at most, their remnants will have to flee to Bessarabien, where they'll join the Russians. Either way, the crossing of the passes has been a magnificent victory for us.
