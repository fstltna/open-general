03. BALIKPAPAN (24 January 1942)

STRATEGIC SITUATION:
The Japanese wave south seems unstoppable. Tarakan has fallen and the next target, again an important oil region, is Balikpapan. The Japanese have landed east of Balikpapan City and have cut the road between Balikpapan and Samarinda. You must make contact with the cut off forces at Samarinda where special demolition teams that are blowing up the oilfields are assembled too. It is essential that these specialists are rescued. Also you must make sure the route of retreat remains safe.

TACTICAL ORDERS:
Hold your line at Balikpapan City and retake the airfield. Next you must clear the Balikpapan-Samarinda road from Japanese so that our forces there can be saved. Further on you must be able to escape south west to Bandjermasin so hold a close eye on that road. The Japanese are known to appear where they are not expected. They are excellent jungle fighters.
