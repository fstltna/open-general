You start in 1939 as a colonel of the Turkish Army. The Turkish Army lacks proper equipment and training. The old comrades from the Great War, the Germans, are in war with France and Britain. Both countries have agreed to support each other. When Germany attacks the Soviet-Union Turkey will also join the war, relying on its training and better equipment and its Allies. Can you conquer the Caucasus, drive the British out of the Middle-East and unite all Turks into an giant pan-Turkish Empire?
