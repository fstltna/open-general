"Commo,pluck that officer out of the water".The Italian crew pulled the officer aboard the launch."Captain Sentra,this officer is a Admiral"."Well salute Him and bring Him here".British Admiral Vian was brought to the Captain."This Day has not favored You,has it Admiral.You no longer have a Royal Navy and We the Italians now own the Sand and the Sea.The Glory of Rome is once again shining for all the World to admire.What do You say to that Admiral"? "I cannot deny We Brits have failed.And today is as sorry a day as I will ever see thanks to Your Navy.As far as the World admiring Rome I feel You are wrong on that count.I believe the 'Frau's of the SS is what the World is seeing shine and also alarmed about and their Insane Evil Leader in Berlin.You Italians are playing second Fiddle and I imagine as soon as Russia falls Fraulien Koch will turn Her attention towards You and 'Il Duce and do what She has done to all the other Males She has encountered,walk all over them in Her High Heels and grind them into the dirt". "Don't be Stupid Admiral,Women ruling the World. Us Italians can handle Women,even those in the SS"."Yes Captain,keep thinking that.We thought that.The French thought that.Stalins learning now.And don't forget 'Il Duce's friend Hitler.I am sure You Italians can stop the SS Frau's when No-one else has.The only ones with a slim chance to stop the Frau's would be the Americans but their Time is short too with what's happened in the Solomons".
