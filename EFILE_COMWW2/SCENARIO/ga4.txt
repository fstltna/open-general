Zhukov: Red God of War

"Georgi K. Zhukov's way of fighting a battle, (and it may have been a way dictated as much by necessity as by design), was to let the enemy extend himself; to wait until the last moment  of enemy offensive momentum, and then to grind them down in terrible bloody exchanges as they moved in for their objective. Meanwhile, despite fearful Soviet losses and dangerous enemy penetration, Zhukov cautiously, carefully, and painstakingly massed reserve armies which he refused to commit to action, no matter what the peril at the front. Then, at the moment when German strength was spent, he would unleash the counterblow with dramatic rapidity-often within 48 hours of a German pause, and before the Nazis were able to estabilish a reliable defence."
