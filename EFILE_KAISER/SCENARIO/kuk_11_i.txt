Duklapass

Jan 26th, 1915

The time goes by, and our comrades in Premissel are still trapped, besieged by the Russians. We can't leave them there. We must keep on trying, until we open a gap in the Russian lines. Our casualties are horrendous, and our men are exhausted, but we won't abandon our brethren while there is a spark of life in our souls.

This time you'll try to storm the Russian positions at the Duklapass, on the Karpaten. From there, we could send our divisions to liberate Premissel. Besides, it's a strategic position that the Russians will use, sooner or later, to invade the Hungarian Plains. If we control the area, we could be confident that our enemies will never attack the heart of the Empire.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.

Special note:
- Don't forget that you can buy trucks for your light units.
