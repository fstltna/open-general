Kresna Gorge

July 27th, 1913

Despite your successful maneuvers, by now it's obvious that we are going to lose this war. We counted on a quick, decisive victory against Serbia while holding out the Greek Army before our other neighbours could react. But nothing of that happened. Still weakened after the war against the Ottomans, we had to go on the defensive in all fronts, and Romania and Turkey mobilized their troops sooner than we expected. In fact, the Turks have just retook Odrin, and the Romanians are at the gates of Sofia.
Now we need an inmediate peace treaty at all costs. With every passing day without a peace agreement, the conditions will be harder on us. We must convince our enemies that a cease fire is good for them, too.
We have a great opportunity for that here, at the Struma Valley. Recently, our 4th and 5th Armies managed to stop the Serbian counterattack at Kalimanci, so they have been able to send reinforcements to us. In the meantime, the Greek Army of Thessaly, commanded by the very King Konstantinos, is marching through the narrow Kresna Gorge, with little space for maneuvering. While you hold the bulk of the Greek army, our flanks will try to envelope the Greeks. If they fall into our trap, they will have to stop theit offensive and peace will be their best option.

Victory conditions: Take all VHs.
                              
Note: If you wish, you can deploy two core units in your left flank.
