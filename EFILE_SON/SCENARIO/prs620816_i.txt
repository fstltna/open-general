Battle of Reichenbach
August 16, 1762

After defeating the Austrians at Burkersdorf, Frederick II instantly proceeded upon Schweidnitz. The Austrians had improved the fortifications of Schweidnitz to prevent its capture by storm; thus forcing the Prussians to undertake a formal siege, which began on August 8. The Prussians deployed a covering force in continuous positions all around the fortress to prevent the intervention of any Austrian relief force. To break the encirclement of the fortress, Feldmarshal Daun ordered the Austrian troops to attack the Prussian entrenched positions near Reichenbach.
