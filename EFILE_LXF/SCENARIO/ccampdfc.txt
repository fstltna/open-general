1938 FALL GRUEN
German Campaign

The United Kingdom and France agreed to Germany's demands for the annexation of the Sudetenland, belonging to Czechoslovakia, at the Conference of Munich. Now, on 1 September 1938, German forces will cross the Czech border on a wide front. In contrary to what historically happened, the Czechs will not lay down their arms without a fight. This time they will fight. The Czechoslovakian army is the most modern of Central Europe. This invasion will be the first fighting campaign for Germany since the end of the Great War. The German army is not prepared and is inexperienced, in contrary to the German army that would overrun France only two years later. The Czechs stand alone, so are the Germans. Can the Germany succeed? It is up to you and your men!
