I was at last about to greenlight your next assault of Egypt but something very bad just happened: Americans are landing  in Morocco and Algeria, and, as expected the Vichy French have betrayed us...

This means we are henceforth facing a two-front fight: The Americans are west of here, the British east of here, and the impenetrable desert south of us.
You can't fight on both fronts at the same time, and the Italian troops on our west border are lacking both numbers and quality to successfully repel the Americans. If we don't do something immediately, they will overrun Libya in a week or two and fall on our backs.

Fortunately those American troops are totally inexperienced and unorganized - But if the last war was any indication they won't stay it for long.
Our only option is to take advantage of the fact our Italian auxilliaries have solidly dug in here, hope we'll be back before the British realize we're gone,  and to rush capture French Tunisia and beat the still inexperienced American troops decisively. Decisively enough so the Italian troops can take it from there and chase them back into the sea, while you rush back to El Alamein and finish throwing the British out of Egypt. This will be a busy month.
