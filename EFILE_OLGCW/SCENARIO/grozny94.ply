Three years after the dissapear of the USSR, the rebel republic of Chechnya, now known as the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria leaded by the former soviet air general Dzhokar Dudayev, continues out and far from the Moscow control. In August of 1994, the opposition to the president Dudayev was armed and supported by the Federal Russian Army, but this force was not enough to throw the rebel goverment of Grozny. Some months later, in December, the russians decided to begin the full scale assault of Chechnya in a limited war exercise carried out mainly by unexperienced recruits. Soon, the russians realized that the chechen irregular forces and their guerrillas could become a major problem for modern conventional forces.
