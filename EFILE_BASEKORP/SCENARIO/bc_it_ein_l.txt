LOSS

Well, that wasn't so cunning a plan was it?  The German Army that was supposedly on its knees somehow managed to stop our advance to the Rhine, our airborne chaps have suffered tremendously at Arnhem, and the Germans are now threatening to cut across our single road of advance.  This is a crisis.  A large crisis. In fact, if you've got a moment, it's a twelve-story crisis with a magnificent entrance hall, carpeting throughout, 24-hour portage, and an enormous sign on the roof, saying 'This Is a Large Crisis'. A large crisis requires a large plan. Get me two pencils and a pair of underpants.
