LOSS

This was the major battle of the Ogaden, the only large-scale fighting that took place there, confused as it must be when the ground is such that it is impossible to talk of a front, only of a series of separate combats, and when the climate is such that fighting has to halt while both sides seek water and rest.

The men of Illubabor, Gemu Gofa, and of Kulu had traveled so far to fight. Where men on foot fought with men on foot, the battle swayed homerically first to one side, then to another. 

But Nasi had formed mechanized columns to encircle the Ethiopians.
