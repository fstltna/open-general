Commander, this victory was very costly.  Our troops are facing critical shortages and General Kasshoku somehow made his back to Tokyo. Many in Japan have gained heart at the escape of their greatest hero. As for the Military, it has steeled their resolve to carry out the war until the bitter end. It has also been reported that Tojo himself has offered a sizeable reward to the soldier who can kill or capture you. Be careful, Commander, the enemy is growing fanatical and some Japanese soldier may try to collect that reward!
