I'm glad that you managed to escape alive, General. It's a pity that so many of our brave men can't say the same. The Russians are taking tens of thousands of prisoners, and are finding tons of equipment that we had to leave behind. Don't feel bad for it, it's not your fault. Obviously, we had underestimated our enemies. Or, maybe, we had overestimated our own strength.

Now the High Command believes that we'll have time to build a solid defence line around the fortress of Premissel. After seeing how Lemberg fell, I'm not so optimistic. It'll be better to build a second line on the Karpaten. It'll be easier to stop the Russians there. I hope I'm wrong, but I think that we'll need it.
