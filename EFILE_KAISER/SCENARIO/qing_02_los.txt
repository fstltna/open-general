The Chinese counterattacks were useless. The French conquered Lang Son four days later, and for some time they even fought against the Chinese at the Zhennan Pass. Luckily, they were suffering from tropical diseases, hunger and lack of ammunition, so they finally had to stop their offensive and, fearing that we could harass them and outflank them, they left Lang Son and returned to Hanoi.

Most of northern Tonkin was now in Chinese hands, except for Tuyen Quang, where a French contingent had been besieged since November of 1884. Desperately in need for a victory that could make them recover their morale, the French decided to send a relief column to Tuyen Quang and rescue their defenders. Naturally, the Chinese would do their best to thwart the enemy's plans.
