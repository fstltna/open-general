The tide turns: Chistopol

May 26th, 1919

The spring wasn't over yet, and it seemed that we were about to repel the last counterattacks made by the Bolsheviks. Reaching the Volga wasn't a long term plan anymore. Victory was so close that I could almost grasp it. 

But there was a last effort that we had to do. Most of the Second Red Army had gathered in Chistopol, and it had launched a new, desperate counteroffensive against us. I trusted my men, but I knew that the attack of our enemies was dangerous. If we didn't stop the communists Bugulma would fall, Ufa would be in danger, and all our front could fall apart. That could not happen. Not then. Not when the Volga was so near. We had to prevail.

Victory conditions:
- After 19 turns, you must hold 5 VHs for a BV, 4 VHs for a V, and 3 VHs for a TacV.
