Metemma - Mar 9th, 1889

"And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof"
Rev. 5, 5

When Emperor Yohannes decided to attack the Sudanese before dealing with Menelik's insolence, he had said: "if I come back I can fight Shewa later on when I return. And if I die at Metemma in the hands of the heathens, I shall go to heaven". We would soon learn that those were truly prophetic words.

Initially, I was optimistic about the outcome of the battle. Yohannes had mobilized an army of more than 100,000 infantrymen and nearly 20,000 horse riders. Most of them were levies with little combat experience, but not all of them. My own troops, for example, could be compared favourably to any colonial unit of that time, due to years of training and hard discipline.

The Mahdists feared us, and they fortified themselves at Gallabat as soon as they knew that Yohannes's army was on the march. It would be hard to break into the town, but we were determined to overcome the Saracens forever. Destroying that stronghold was all we needed.

Victory conditions: 
Take all the VHs.
