Liberating Manchuria

Nov 16th, 1900

The Russian strategy in Manchuria relied completely on controlling the Chinese Eastern Railway. Although some parts of the line didn't have been built yet, it was a formidable piece of engineering that would soon communicate Chita and Vladivostok with Harbin and Liushun. Without that railway, the Russians wouldn't be able to remain in Chinese territory.

That's the reason why we planned an attack against the Russian stronghold of Mukden. Thanks to the railway, it was the most important base of operations that our enemies had in southern Manchuria. The Russian presence there was a permanent threat to Peking, so recovering that town was vital for China. But first the Qing soldiers would have to fight the many Siberian regiments and Cossack squadrons that were defending Mukden and its neighbouring area.

Victory conditions:

- Take all the VHs.
