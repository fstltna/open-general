PEREKOP (28 October 1920)

Quickly, comrade.  We have almost made it to the Perekop isthmus.  If those Tsarists are willing to make a stand against the glorious people of Russia then they will do it there!

While other armies are mopping up enemy criminals that have been encircled, all of the remaining people's army not occupied with that task is being directed to the Perekop isthmus. They will be placed under your command as soon as they arrive in the region, comrade! In Moscow they regard you as a military genius!  The Revolution is driving the proletariat to great acts!

Your horses are the most mobile force that we have, comrade.  Dash to the isthmus and force your way into the Crimea!!!
