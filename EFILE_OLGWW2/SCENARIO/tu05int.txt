Mareth Line:

March 20th, 1943

We are facing a terrible situation, the British 8th Army is going to attack our last bastion and our scout units say that Monty has sent the 2nd NZ division through the mountains, at the same time, he is going to launch a full frontal attack against our lines.

Avoid his success at all the costs !
