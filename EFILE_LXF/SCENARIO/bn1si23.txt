5 Mar 1945

Hypothetical German airborne assault on the city Ufa at the Ural Mountains. The plan was created 1942 by paratrooper General Kurt Student for the destruction of war industry and the interruption of the Soviet main supply route, the Trans-Siberian railway. Execution failed finally on realities. In addition it would have required 150 large transporters (Me323 Giants) and 300 gliders as well as the total air control.
