Message from General Sanjurjo Sacanell's HQ:

Axdir is ours! Our glorious army controls the territory of the Beni Urriaguel "kabila". Abd el-Krim and some of his men escaped at the last minute, but it doesn't matter. We have won this war, after so many years!

Of course, it will take some months to pacify the country completely, but the indigenous police will be able to do that without our support. Abd el-Krim will be captured sooner or later, he doesn't have anywhere to hide any more.

You are a hero, General. Your inspiring leadership has been decisive to obtain this victory. Now Spain will have peace, and hopefully for many years. Congratulations, General!


The campaign is over. I hope that you have enjoyed it. Thanks for playing.
