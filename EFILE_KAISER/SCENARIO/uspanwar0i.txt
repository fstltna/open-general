The Margallo War
(2 October 1893)
v.1.0
The sunset of the Spanish Empire - The Spanish-American War 1898

Teniente,

Congratulations on becoming a Commissioned Officer!

As you know, the fortifications surrounding Melilla (one of our cities in North Africa) are being expanded and new redoubts are being erected. Unfortunately a holy place has been demolished and Moroccans across the province (known as Rifians) have rushed to arms against Spain and called for a jihad.
 
Some 25,000 Rifian warriors have descended from the mountains and attacked Melilla's garrison (about 3,000). The situation is critical. Troops are retreating to Melilla which may be soon under siege.
 
Your first assignment will be with the relief troops.

Victory conditions: Hold 7 hex for a BV, 5 for a V and 3 for a TV.

Paqueo,
December 2013
