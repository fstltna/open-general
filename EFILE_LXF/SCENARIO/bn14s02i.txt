STORY

Chiang, hoping to remain on the offensive, had all uncommitted troops thrown into the Kiangsi sector. Included were the fourth class of officers graduated in October from Whampoa Academy and rushed north to lead new recruits from Hunan and Hupei. The revitalized NRA began to crack Sun’s rather demoralized defense and to move forward. First Sun’s southern line sagged under the assault of the Second Army and the Fourteenth, a unit that had defected from Sun early in the Kiangsi campaign. By October 27, Sun’s units from southern Kiangsi were in retreat north through Nanchang. As the campaign entered November, the NRA gathered along the Hsiu valley for a push against the Kiukiang-Nanchang line defending the railway. Reinforced by the Fourth Army’s Tenth Division under Ch’en Ming-shu, the Seventh Army again swept down on the lowland defenses at Tehan. When the line crumpled there, the NRA cut the arterial rail line, which isolated Sun’s troops south along Poyang Lake. The capture of the ports of Kiukiang and Huk’ou on the Yangtze further strangled the provincial capital of Nanchang. By November 9, Nanchang had fallen and Sun’s troops were in general retreat down the Yangtze valley. As the momentum of the NRA offensive swept Sun’s remnants from Kiangsi, Chiang again sent his agent to offer Sun a role in the revolution and the coming unification of China.
In the Kiangsi campaign, both sides had thrown their best troops into the intense two-month battle; the casualties were among the highest incurred in the Northern Expedition. According to official KMT records, the final week’s push to take the Kiukiang-Nanchang Railroad cost the NRA 20,000 casualties and the enemy 40,000. The longer preceding period of bitterly contested setbacks for the NRA may have cost it an other 100,000. Victory for the NRA had also meant the capture of large amounts of needed arms and ammunition, which greatly expanded its fighting potential. At Nanchang alone, although the NRA suffered nearly 4,000 casualties, it took 15,000 prisoners and 20,000 rifles - enough to arm an army corps. The victory had been won despite the lack of heavy artillery, and thereafter other warlords would face a larger, better-armed, and battle-hardened enemy.
