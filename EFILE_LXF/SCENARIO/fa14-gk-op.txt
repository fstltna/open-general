02/11/1940   Trench Warfare

Hey, you're an Everstiluutnantti now. Not long and you've got me...
The Soviet artillery has ploughed up the whole front in this sector. It's just like the Great War with the 27th Jaeger battalion.
Situation report: The situation is very critical here between my 3rd Corps and Kenraaliluutnantti Oehquists 2nd Corps. You are our only reserves and the Russians are advancing in strength.
Enemy: 17th and 142nd Rifle divisions reinforced by squadrons of aircraft. The Reds are said to be testing a new super heavy tank here.
Our forces: You will strengthen the 2nd and 8th Divisions with your units and the bombers of the 4th Aviation regiment are under your command. Unfortunately any fighter protection is left up to you.

By the way: watch your left flank, as it's very thin and the Russian will surly try to cross the Vuoksi River.
