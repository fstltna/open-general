May, 19., 1863  Vicksburg


Dear Friend, 
the president has attached the USS Moose to our army corps... 
I think she will be quite useful for us in the future...
So here I am again back to the Mississipi valley where everything started for me...
After all the drawbacks here a unique chance is offered to us.


ORDERS:
General, if Vicksburg is taken, only Port Hudson is left as last resort on the Mississipi for the rebels...   
If we can control both cities we have split the Confederates in two pieces....

TAKE AL VHs


ADVICE FROM YOUR OLDEST SERGEANT:
do not sell the USS Moose ! 
She will be of benefit for us till the end of war...

you should deploy most of your men in the west, to take the desoto peninsula.... and your cavalry should help in the east....
