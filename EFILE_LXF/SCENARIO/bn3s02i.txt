Colonel, with your help Beiping is now in our hands, very good work.  The Chinese forces withdrew in the northwest direction into the Chahar Province.  They will now try to establish a new strong defensive position around the city Kalgan.  To avoid this, you will advance your troops along the Yungting River to the city Chenpiecheng and immediately attack the Chinese.
