Hold that Lines, Comrades ! Hold that damned Lines !
 

Herr General ! They've flank us at Waghäusel..... we didn't expect this....





Herr General ! We're just Craftsmen and Advocats ! We're standing against professional Soldiers !....
Hold that Line ! Just hold it, in the Name of the Repblic ! Hold that damned Line !
