Lieutenant Colonel, the landing in England stands before! You will drop in the morning with the 7th Air Division in the area of Dover. Your task will be to protect our HQ and airport and to neutralize the enemy air defence and artillery positions. This is necessary in order to allow us to carry out further landing operations from air and sea. Protect the bridgehead and then advance into the interior. Your mission is absolutely vital for the success of this operation. Give you best, Lieutenant Colonel!
