Your light tanks company is a part of a panzer battalion tasked with breaking through the Soviet defense west of Vyazma. A river crossing is held by enemy artillery, but your reconnaisance found a ford north of your starting positions. Infantry support must outflank the artillery, clear the village, and secure the bridgehead. Rush towards your main objective and rendezvous with forward elements of Waffen-SS division approaching from the south. Destroy the Soviet blockade in the nearby city.

Soviet forces are comprised mainly of lower-quality troops, fresh conscripts, and partisan fighters based in the nearby hamlets. Destroy the NKVD blocking troops, thus facilitating a complete annihilation of Soviet resistance in the area.

Tip: Don't waste units on garrison duties. Move forwards as fast as possible, knocking out the Soviets one by one by your local superiority in numbers.
