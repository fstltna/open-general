We have failed to save the trapped men....but it was a lost cause.  The thick fog and heavily bogged roads made rapid advance impossible.  Now we, ourselves must try and escape before we are encircled.

(Historical note:  After the failure to save the trapped divisions the Leibstandarte itself was encircled at Kamenets-Podolski.  The casualties were horrendous.  Only 1,250 men remained.  The remnants were able to fight their way out west back to German lines.  The division would soon be in Belgium to await the Allied landings in France.)
