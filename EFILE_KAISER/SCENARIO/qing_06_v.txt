The Japanese invasion of Manchuria was a disaster for them. Only a few hundred troops of the Land of the Rising Sun could be evacuated and returned safely to their country. Most of the members of the Second Japanese Army were either killed or taken prisoner, and soon the Chinese soldiers regained control of the right bank of the Yalu river.

Sadly, we couldn't advance any further. The Japanese still had the resources to disembark more troops in mainland China and, if they attacked Manchuria again, or even Weihawei, our elite troops would have to move quickly to that area and overcome the new threat.That would be an impossible task if the Chinese soldiers were stationed in Korea.

For their part, the Japanese had had enough fighting. Peace negotiations started in December, and on 17 January 1895 both countries signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki. China had to accept a Japanese protectorate over Southern Korea, with capital in Seoul, while Pyongyang would be the capital of the Kingdom of Northern Korea, under Chinese influence.

Given the circumstances, the end of the war didn't have been too bad for the Qing Empire, but the loss of part of Korea was a terrible blow for the Chinese pride. Sorrow and resentment against foreigners, especially Westerners and Japanese, spread incredibly fast in all the country. Millions of voices cried for revenge, for the expulsion of the "white devils" and for the end of the foreign concessions. The Chinese government, which secretly supported those claims, did nothing to control the protesters, and as the century came to and end it was obvious that a new war would start soon. All that we could do was to go on with the modernization of the Chinese Army, and pray for being ready when the Empire needed us.
