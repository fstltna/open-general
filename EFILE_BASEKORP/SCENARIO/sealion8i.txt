Thames Estuary

The Thames River Mouth is the key to London. Control both sides of the River and your advance on the british capital will be unstopable. The british troops are in uncontrolled retreat. You should keep the momentum commander! Push forward and take the important airfields and roads to London.

Historical Info:

The Maunsell naval forts were built in the Thames estuary and operated by the Royal Navy, to deter and report German air raids following the Thames as a landmark, and prevent attempts to lay mines by aircraft in this important shipping channel (Navy forts). Maunsell also designed forts for anti-aircraft defence (operated by the Army). During World War II, the Thames estuary forts shot down 22 aircraft and about 30 flying bombs (Army forts) and sunk one E-boat (Navy forts).

They were decommissioned by the Ministry of Defence in the late 1950s and became home for pirate radio stations and the micronation "Principality of Sealand".
