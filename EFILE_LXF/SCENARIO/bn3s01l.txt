General Seishiro Itagaki

What a shame, Colonel!  You were stymied by only one Chinese division!  As a result the landing of the 5th Division will substantially delayed!  Fortunately with some reinforcement the Port of Taku could be still taken.  The GHQ is not amused about that and has accepted your resignation!
