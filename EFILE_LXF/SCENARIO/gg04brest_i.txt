Herr General,

You are to continue your drive south towards Brest.

XIX Corps Battleplan:

1. Move your Corps through the town of Balava and take Zabinka. Reports suggest there are Polish armoured units in this area.

2. Once Zabinka is secured split into two battlegroups and take the town of Kobryn and the city of Brest simultaneously.
Intelligence reports tell us that Zabinka and Kobryn are defended by elements of the improvised 60th Infantry Division while we believe Brest has only March Battalions or the "Kitchen Corps" garrisoning the fortress.

Player Note: Bypass the direct route south to Brest and take Balava.

Recomended purchase: - Infantry (truck)

Suggested Core: - 1x Tank, 3x Infantry, 1x Recon, 1x Artillery, 1x Tac Bomber.

Max Core: - 7x Ground Units.

Good luck.
