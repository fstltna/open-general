Orders:

Commander, most of Sicily is under allied contrill. Axis forces are withdrawing to the northeastern tip of Sicily arround the city of Messina. Some had already crossed the Messina Strait in the previous nights and took position around Regio di Calabria. Your orders are to free the messina area and cross the Messina Strait in order to conquer Regio. Your forces will belong to the first allied units to put a foot onto the mainland of Italy. 

Expect strong coastal artillery and many anti-aircraft batteries on both sides of the Messina Strait.

Notes:

British Reinforcements are expected to arrive soon.

The unit that takes Messina will raise a leader!
