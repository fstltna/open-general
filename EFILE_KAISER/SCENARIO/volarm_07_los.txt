I couldn't retake Velikoknyazheskaya, but at least the offensive of the 10th Army has stopped. The Bolsheviks have understood that staying on this bank of the Manych is becoming dangerous for them, so they have retreated. Now our right flank is secured and we can finally help the Don cossacks at Tsaritsyn.
