    Operation "Wintergewitter" - 12 dec 1942
___________________________________________

    Operation "Wintergewitter" undertaken between 12 and 23 December 1942 aimed to create a link with the Axis troops in Stalingrad. The main blow was going to be delivered by the German 57th Panzer Corps (6th and 23rd Panzer Division - 230 tanks). On its left flank was the Romanian 6th Corps (2nd and 18th Infantry Divisions). On the right flank was the Romanian 7th Corps (1st and 4th Infantry Divisions) and the Cavalry Group "Gen. Popescu" (5th and 8th Cavalry Divisions). The German tanks advanced up to 50 km from Stalingrad, but were stopped.
   The failure of Operation "Wintergewitter" sealed the fate of Axis troops inside Stalingrad.
