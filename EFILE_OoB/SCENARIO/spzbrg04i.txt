Road to Bergen

Part 1/2 of the "Norwegen" minicampaign


"Boys, come here. Don't gape at those panzern, Rudi. They'd be helpful, I admit, but do you wish to stick one into the glider, or what? You may ask Major Bistroff if he will lend it to you.

So, High Command wants us to achieve this airfield and either capture or destroy the radio station before they can alert the local defense. As we all know how inaccurate the drops may be, our secondary task is the naval battery here at the strait.

Norwegian units are small and few. I hope that once the ground forces reach us, the battle will be over. After all, we're paratroopers, not some ladies on a walk."


Victory conditions: Capture all VHs.

Hint: This scenario uses limited deployment, use the "View the Strategic Map" feature first!
