1912 Battle of the Garet Plains

(Part of the Kert campaign)

March, 22nd, 1912

Message from General García Aldave's HQ:

After your success in Melilla more than two years ago the area patrolled by our army has reached the eastern bank of the Kert river.  Due to the rough terrain and the lack of resources we could not build permanent positions. 

For some time the local "kabilas" acted peacefully, but last year a new rebellion started.  This time headed by Mohamed el-Mizzian.  The first attack was against a topographic surveying unit in August.  Now the Berber rebels have started repeatedly crossing the river Kert in order to harass both our military patrols and our allied "kabilas".  Since October we have launched different military operations in the area, but we haven't been able to stop the rebels.  This can't go on.  Finally our Government has approved a major offensive against the enemy "kabilas" and we need you to once again command your troops in battle. If all goes well el-Mizzian's defeat will be permanent!


Victory conditions: Take all VHs.
