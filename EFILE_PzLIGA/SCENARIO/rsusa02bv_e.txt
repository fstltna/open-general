BRILLIANT VICTORY

This was one of the bloodiest battles I have ever seen... however the victory is ours, and the Americans have accepted our peace treaty, our ''Treaty of San Francisco''.  Now, the war in the Pacific has ended.  This is our V-Day in the Pacific!  Hahaha!  The Pacific is in our hands and your name will join our other heroes to become part of Imperial Japanese history!
