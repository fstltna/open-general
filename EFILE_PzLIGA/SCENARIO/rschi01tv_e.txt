TACTICAL VICTORY

The high command is not pleased with your victory over the Chinese elite troops in Shanghai.  In the future we expect a marked improvement in your command skills.  Anyway, Chiang and his troops won't be a threat for the moment.

Your next destination is Korea and Commander we need officers there.
