Herr General,

Thank god you managed to restore the situation and kept up the morale.

The situation is as follows: As you know Hitler has died of a bomb blast in the Wolfsschanze and the army has performed a coup d'etat. General Beck, the old chief of staff has become head of state, marshall Von Witzleben commander in chief, and the parliament of 1933 including the communists has been called back. Becoming chancellor Herr Speer has played an admirable role in the whole affair winning over a lot of officials to the new order.   

We will now run this war in the only sensible way. This means we will retreat to the Seine, and concentrate all efforts on making an honourable peace.
