General Alfredo Guzzoni 

General, you tried everything, but the enemy was simply too strong! It seems that the war is probably over soon. In the whole country unrests broke out, the industry is ruined and our army defeated. But the Italian nation celebrates you! It will always keep your heroic acts in memory.

Thanks for playing, hope you enjoyed the campaign!
