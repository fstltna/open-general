24. BUCHAREST (30 August 1944)

Great news from some days ago: the Rumanians have surrendered to the mighty Soviet Union and are now fighting against the Germans. The German fascists are in disarray and lack leadership. Many of their forces find themselves trapped in Rumania. However there are still Rumanian fascists in the Rumanian Army that refuse to surrender and remain loyal to their fascists leaders and the Germans. Your force is closest to the Rumanian capital of Bucharest. You must rush into the city and clear it of any enemy. Moskva does not care who gets shot. Just make sure we are in possession of Bucharest as soon as possible. Watch out for still retreating Germans in the countryside. Also the Germans might plan to send reinforcements to the city by air. You will be supported by Rumanian units that have switched sides. It is a confusing time, but you must succeed.

I should warn you that you are close to the Bulgarian border. We are not in war with Bulgaria though the country is allied to Germany. You have orders not to cross the Danube and leave the Bulgarians for what they are. On later date Moskva will decide what we will do with Bulgaria.  Good luck, comrade.
