And now for something completely different!

You now have a formidable force, how about putting it to the test, by trying the most difficult of exercises, a full scale naval landing against a fortified coast?

For the fun, the map situation is vaguely inspired by the Normandy coast and hinterland.
You have two beaches to chose from: The northern one has broader sand beaches, and that's the only difference between them, besides this they are pretty much the same.
Expect a strong opposition on both, and beware, the center bay has some naval artillery waiting to take a piece out off your army.

You don't have an airport and won't be able to deploy planes till you've captured a beachhead and built a landing strip. To prevent you from getting sunk by enemy bombers before even reaching the beach, we lend you 4 Artilleriefährprahms (Artillery Ferries) for the duration of the scenario. They are slow and unwieldy, but their 88 mm Flaks will keep the sky clear until you can bring in your fighters. You also get temporarily a couple scout Schnellboote (S-Boot).
A last thing, in case you don't notice it: Once you've captured any of the two ports in the bay you can use it to bring in more troops (if you need or want).
