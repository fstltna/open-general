Gospodin General, the Kerensky offensive has failed dramatically.  Along the entire Galician front:  from Lutsk to Marasti our valiant attacks pushed the enemy back from their first lines but failed to break them.  The devastating blow that came on July 14th was carried out by the German XXIII Reserve Corps (1st Guard, 2nd Guard, 6th German divisions, and the 33rd Austro-Hungarian division) in the viscinity of Zloczow.  The German divisions in the XXIII Reserve Corps were transferred from the Western Front specifically for this operation.

The German counterattack treatened to cut off our troops west of the Sereth River.  On 21st July the Belgian Armored Car Corps was called in from Tarnopol to halt the enemy on the approaches to this key city on the Sereth.  The VI Corps made a fighting retreat with disordered communication lines.  At the Sereth the Belgians rallied our troops, and the German advance was halted.
