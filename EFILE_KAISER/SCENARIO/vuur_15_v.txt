Kimberley is finally ours, Rhodes is our prisoner, and in the north de Wet has overcome the British at Gaberones. Only Mafikeng still resists us, but sooner or later it will fall.

The British have lost the initiative and we must make sure that things won't change. Between the Modder River and Kaapstad there are only a handful of Rooineks, and we must take advantage of that. Your next destination will be Port Elizabeth. They won't expect us there.
