This is Lupo Efile Version 3.xx

This efile is meant to cover the time period from 1979 onward. It is particularly focused on PBEM games and especially according to the game style used at M&L WW3,
a multiplayer PBEM campaign of grand strategy using the new Open General engine for tactical engagements.

Current Version: BETA 0.2

Efile main caratteristics are:

*Missiles: planes, helicopters, ships and some artilleries can use "special units" as missiles using the carrier system. 
	** All missiles are kamikaze units, once used are lost.
	** All air-to-air missiles to be used by planes are in the air defence class.
	** All air-to-ground missiles and special bombs to be used by planes and helicopters are in "strategic air support - missiles" class (PG2 level bomber class).
	** All naval missiles (antiship, cruise or ballistic) are in "amphibious ship - naval missiles" class (PG2 battleship class).
	** All ground launched missiles are in artillery class and can be launched by units in the same class.

*Single fire support: any unit attacked will receive only one fire support mission from friendly units.

*Helicopters: PG2 flack class has been converted into helicopter class they can be differentiated into many roles in particular some of them use the carrier system.
	** Attack helicopters can launch missiles.
	** Assault helicopters can launch missiles and carry some troops.
	** Transport helicopters can carry a large variety of light units.

*Naval aviation: due to carrier system limitations it's been decided that embarked aircrafts won't be able to carry missiles but can engage at longer range than
	standard range 2 for fighters and can bomb within full range for ground attack planes, same for helicopters. Each embarked plane has both a ground and a carrier
	variant.

*Mechanized Infantry: in addition to Armoured Personal Carrier oranic transport some units of "Armoured Vehicles" class (PG2 Anti-Tank class) can 
	tranport dedicated infantry units.These vehicles can provide support fire and together with their infatry have "exploit success" special.

*Fire support: fire support has been given to "Gound Defence" class (PG2 Fortification class) where all static weapons units like AT gund and launchers can be found.

*Counter Battery Fire: some heavy artilleris can provide counter battery fire.

*Shoot and scoot: rocket artillery like BM-21 Grad and most modern rapid fire artilleries have recon move special to avoid enemy counter battery fire.

*Submarines: Attack and ballistic subarines can be found in submarine class, ballistc submarines have a special naval transport to be used with the normal unit.

*All Weather: Radar Air Defence and most advanced planes and helicopters have All Weather special

*Evade: to compensate the missile system and reflect some unit evasive nature some classes and special units are given evade special 
	** 30% helicopters 
	** 45% fighters 
	** 45% tactical air support (PG2 tactical bombers)
	** 45% strategic air support (PG2 level bombers)
	** 30% submarines
	** 15% infantries (commandos like only)
	** 15% recons

*Anti missiles defence: air to ground missiles are "naval targets", so all Air defences with naval attack of at lest 1 can defend against missile attack. 
	Naval missiles are "air targets" though.

*Naval units: naval classes have been redefined according to modern classification and roles
	** submarine: all submarine units are in this class.
	** frigate: this class is mostly dedicate to anti submarine warfare, some units haven't ASW special though (PG2 destroyer class).
	** amphibious ship - missiles: dedicated amphibious landing ships are in this class together with all naval missiles (PG2 battleship class).
	** carrier: all aircraft carriers are in this class.
	** naval trasnport: small landing crafts are in this class.
	** cruiser: these are the most prowerfull surface ships with anti-air and lasting suppression capability (PG2 battle cruiser class).
	** destroyer: ships in this class are dedicated to fleed air defence with offensive and defensive capabilities except a few units (PG2 cruiser class).
	** corvette: all minor ships are in this class, includind patrol boats and such (PG2 light cruiser class).

*Anti Submarine Warfare: apart from frigates also some helicopters and planes have ASW special, there are some naval missiles with ASW special also that can be fired 
	by many non-frigate ships. 

*Engineers: other than normal Engineer infantry units there are some armoured engineer vehicles in "armored vehicles" class, such units can build structures and 
	repair destroyed ones.

*Recon Units: non ground recon units are listed in main classes such as helicopter, tactical and strategic air support.

*Air Intercept: Helicopters and stealth planes can only be intercepted by short range air defence or most advanced air defences.
