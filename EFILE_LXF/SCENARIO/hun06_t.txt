The Battle of Voronezh started on June 28, 1942. The Axis assault was conducted by the element of the German 4th Panzer Army and the Hungarian 2nd Army. By July 3 the German 24th Panzer Division broke the defense line between the Soviet 13th and 40th Armies. On July 4, mechanized division Großdeutschland came to the Western side of the Don and created springboards south-west from Voronezh. The armored units of the 4th Panzer Army partly captured Voronezh on July 6 by occupying the Western river-bank suburbs; however, German troops were subjected to a Red Army counter-attack.

Axis forces could only capture the eastern part of the city at the end of July 14. When Voronezh was occupied, the 4th Panzer Army moved down the Western bank of the Don towards Stalingrad as part of Fall Blau. The Soviets lost the battle, but detained for 4-5 days offensive of German troops to Stalingrad.
