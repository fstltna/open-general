New York, New York
December 7th, 1954

The army of the Socialist States of America supports a civilian disturbance in Union-held New York that quickly escalates into a full scale riot.  Union forces must make their way from Staten Island to Brookyln and Manhattan if they are to reclaim control of the city before the Soviets arrive with an armada to assist their S.S.A. allies.
