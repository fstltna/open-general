Battle of Kasserine Pass

February 16th, 1943

The Anglo-American forces have disembarked in French territory, and set off at full speed following a route to Tunisia. After your defeat in Egypt, this is the only defendable sector of Africa that we have left.
Due to the inexperience of your rivals, their positions are badly defended, but they outnumber you easily and have more supplies.
Your mission:- Advance at full speed and take Tebessa.

Note: In Tebessa, the Allies have a great oil reserve that once captured will make future offensive operations possible.
