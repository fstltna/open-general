16. NOVOROSSIYSK 2 (18 March 1943)

Comrade, althought the fascist invaders cannot do anything about the stunning successes of our winter campaign, they have regained their spirit, again, even after a second winter. In the Ukraine near Kharkov huge battles are being fought and we are not in a position to win easy. We are happy to hold down the Germans. More south, the enemy is still holding the Kuban region, of which the Taman peninsula is only a few miles away from the Kerch peninsula of the Crimea. It offers a safe route of withdrawal for the enemy. 

We have been given orders to drive the enemy out of the Caucasus steppes and the captured Black Sea ports. Attacks on the entire front in the Kuban will be made, but the biggest will take place near Novorossiysk. The Black Sea Fleet has offered a flotilla of cruisers and destroyers as well as thousands of trusty Marines. These, and a part of your force, will land near a large peninula south of Novorossiysk, in order to join up with the force coming from the coast, at Novorissiysk and defeat the enemy. It is a promising plan but it can be done. After all we are pushing the enemy back, west, west, all the the way west where they came from! Good luck, comrade.
