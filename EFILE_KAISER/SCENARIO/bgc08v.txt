Our brave men overran the Turkish lines, stormed the hills and finally took the summits in desperate hand-to-hand combat. But casualties have been heavy, and the Turks have delayed our advance long enough to bring strong reinforcements to the Sair Bair mountains.

HISTORICAL OUTCOME:
The Australian 1st Brigade took Lone Pine after a desperate fight and held it against several Turkish counter-attacks, suffering 1,700 casualties out of 2,900. The 3rd Light Horse Brigade which was given the literally suicidal task to attack the Turkish lines at "The Nek" showed unimaginable heroism, but was nearly wiped out within 15 minutes. Not a single soldier reached the Turkish trenches.
The left column's journey through the tangled ravines was doomed to failure and, having become lost and confused, it never got close to the objective of Hill 971. One battalion of Gurkhas took Hill Q on August 9th, but were then caught in friendly fire. Having suffered heavy casualties and with no reinforcements, the Gurkhas were pushed back off the hill shortly afterwards.
The right column, heading for Chunuk Bair, took this summit on August 8th. The Wellington battalion held off the Turks who were counter-attacking time and time again, but out of the 760 men of the battalion who had reached the summit, 711 became casualties. With Turkish reinforcements arriving quickly, a further advance became impossible.
