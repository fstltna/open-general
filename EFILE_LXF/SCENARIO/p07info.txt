07. FAID PASS (30 January 1943)

Since the Operation Torch landing, Allied forces have moved east, into Tunisia. The Axis have also invaded Tunisia and the current frontline runs through Tunisia along the Eastern Dorsal Range, an important geographical feature. The Allies are gathering forces for the big offensive which will end the Axis presence in North Africa. 

The Germans, however, have started an attack against Faid Pass, a vital pass through the Eastern Dorsal Range with a perfect road. The garrison of Faid Pass, consisting of French units of their XIX (Colonial) Corps and your PEF, had to retreat into the Eastern Dorsal Range under the severe pressure of the German assault. The Germans have lots of experience of years of warfare on various fronts. They are not to be underestimated.

The situation is critical. The German advance must be denied of forcing a gap in the Allied line and therefor Faid Pass has to be recaptured. American armoured reinforcements are underway but it will take some time for them to reach the area. In the mean time, your PEF and the French XIX Corps must hold on to their positions until ready to counterattack! Good luck, General!
