Unternehmen Teutoburg

Jun 4th, 1918

The Bulgarians have been fighting here in Macedonia practically alone since 1915. They have repelled British, French, Serbian and Greek attacks once and again. They're very skilled and brave but, sadly, they aren't strong enough to break through the enemy lines. 

With your intervention, things can change soon. We have a great opportunity to win the war in the Balkans. We've finally signed two peace treaties with the Bolsheviks and with Romania, so the war in the east is over. Besides, it's obvious that the current Entente Spring Offensive in France will be a complete failure. That means that, at last, we can send fresh troops to Macedonia.

Our offensive will have two infiltration points. While the Bulgarians and the Germans attack the Franco-Serbian sector in Bitola, you'll lead the assault against the Greek-British forces at the Dojransee and open the road to Thessaloniki.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.

Special note: 
- You can buy Bulgarian equipment in this scenario.
