General Hongo Yoshio

You have taught the Russians a lesson, General! Unfortunately the Russians broke through on most fronts and further resistance seems pointless. The war is lost for Japan! But the nation will always remembered you as the Unbeaten!

THE END.

Hope you enjoyed the campaign, thanks for playing!  Golothin
