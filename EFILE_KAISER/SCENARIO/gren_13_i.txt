At the Aisne: The first trenches

September 13th, 1914

When Von Kluck realised his mistake he ordered his men to turn back and fight the advancing French Sixth Army, but in doing do he opened a 30 mile gap between his forces and Von Bülow's Second Army, just in front of our forces. After some hesitation, on September 6th we started our advance. We crossed the two Morins and the Marne River, but in the strict sense there was no battle during our march to the North. Only open roads were ahead of us. To our left and our right the Germans hardly managed to hold the French, and finally they were forced to retreat to safer positions. Their summer offensive had failed, and they would never take Paris.

However, our advance was too cautious for fear of being ambushed, and that gave the enemy time to build strong defensive positions on the Northern shore of the Aisne River. The High Command believed that, if we pressed them hard enough, we could break the German lines and force them out of France and, hopefully, the war. I was not so optimistic about the chances of success of a frontal assault, but the night of September 13th the fog was extremely dense, so with God on our side maybe we would surprise the Germans.
