German Colonial Wars

After the late founding of the German Empire in 1871 (It was the second; the first, called 'Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation'  ended in 1806 when Napoleon defeated it.), Germany forced into the rank of the great colonial powers. Germany also requires a 'place in the sun'...

Despite the late acquisition of colonies, Germany was able to secure large territories, especially in Africa. At that time Germany was one of the most modern and most powerful industrialized nations...

From the Boxer Rebellion of 1900, when Kaiser Wilhelm commited troops to China with the infamous 'Hun Speech' (because of that the English call us Germans 'Huns'. Call note of the author) through various uprisings in the colonies up to the courageous defense of German East Africa by von Lettow-Vorbeck in 1918, this mini-campaign includes all the relevant sites of the German colonial history.

By the way, von Lettow-Vorbeck is the only German general of both wars, who is buried in the Federal Republic of Germany with military honors.

Despite of German armament and military officers the combat strength and courage of Askari troops should not be underestimated .*

The scenarios are not 100% authentic and some unit names are fiction...

Have fun!
