RETREAT FROM ROVNO (18 September 1920)

Comrade have I ever told you why I joined the Bolshevik party?  No, but you are right. There is no time for such tales.  I have noticed it, comrade.  Morale is low among the ranks.  The sudden change in the course of the war has left its traces.  This is a serious set back.  But it is merely a set back!

The Northern armies will have to retreat on their own to defensive positions while we prepare to strike again and then finally make the wishes of millions of proletarians come true!  In the south it has been quieter but it seems the imperialists in Warsaw have gathered enough men to continue the counteroffensive in the south as well.

There is no hope of stopping the monarchists now but we will not fall into enemy hands. We will retreat, reorganize and make the Polish capitalists pay for this!  The Revolution will not be tamed!  Make your way east, comrade, the town of Rovno has fallen into the dirty hands of the enemy!  Retreat!
