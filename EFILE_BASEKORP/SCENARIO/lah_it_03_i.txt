General, your troops are to advance across the bridges at Zutphen, and push as quickly and as far as possible, as to support the paradrop on Rotterdam.  We have been attached to the 227th Infantry Division.  We should expect to link up with 9th Panzer Division for the assault on Rotterdam.

(If playing with rules do not buy any new units.)
