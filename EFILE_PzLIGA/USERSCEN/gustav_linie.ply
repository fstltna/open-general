Gustav Line

A historically correct scenario covering those four battles in the center of the Gustav Line:

17.01. - 11.02.1944  Operation Shingle
12.02. - 19.02.1944  Operation Avanger
20.02. - 25.03.1944  Operation Dickens
26.03. - 18.05.1944  Operation Diadem

Two armies, the 5th US and afterwards the 8th British including four corps (II. US Corps, 2nd New Zealand Corps, British XIII Corps, 2nd Polish Corps) try to break through the Gustav Line at its strongest section again and again in order to enforce access to the Liri valley and thereby the way to Rome.

Not until the arrival of the French Expeditionary Corps the Allies manage to overpower the Gustav Line in the South, thus forcing the Germans to retreat in this section of the front. 

For this scenario my Lirital map 590 is required.
