07. SEVASTOPOL 2 (7 June 1942)

To the commanding officer of 22. ID (LL):

After months of preparations and with the coming of summer the siege of Sevastopol will enter its final phase. The plan of 11. Armee to break the enemy is roughly the same as it was last December. From the north and south German divisions will attack and converge while Rumanian units hold the center.

Your division is still part of the northern pincer. You will be fighting on the same soil as during the last attack. Along with the 132. and 50. Infanterie Divisionen on your flanks you are to advance towards the Sevastopol Bay where you ought to meet the southern pincer. In any case it might be possible to cross the Bay with Sturmboote and attack the defenders of the port from behind. The enemy is determined to fight and will only be defeated after bloody fighting.

RULES: 
- Do not upgrade, sell or buy units - nor upgrading transports.
- Replacing lost units by buying new units is allowed. Replacements should be the exact same unit as the lost unit.
