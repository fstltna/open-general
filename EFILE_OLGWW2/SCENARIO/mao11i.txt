Pyongyang Liberation [Korean War]

25-11-1950 Chongchon River, near the Chinese border.

Nice to see you again commander. Your next mission is highly secret and will take you to the Sino-Korean border.  The dirty North American invaders and their South Korean allies have smashed the North Koreans.  Kim-Il-Sung was close to a total victory during the past summer, but he didn't protect his rearguard and as you know, the capitalist operation at Inch'on and Seoul has completely defeated the North Korean advance on Pusan.

We can't allow this situation; the capitalist unification of Korea must not be completed.  A capitalist state in Korea would be like a gun aimed at the People's Republic of China, and we know that the puny North American general McArthur has maintained some conversations with Chaing-Kai-Shek about a possible continuation of the war against us.

Build your army, and cross the Yalu River to help the North Koreans and strike the UN forces.  Liberate Pyongyang to allow further advances to the 38 parallel and beyond.  We will have help from the air from our recently created People's Liberation Army Air Force. Remember all the principles of the People's War doctrine on your way.

Fu qi, commander.
