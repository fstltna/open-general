10. STRUMICA (27 November 1944)

To the commanding officer of 22. ID (LL):

The Red Army threatings the communications between our Heeresgruppe E in the southern Balkans and the Heimat! We leave few garrisons behind in the Aegian but will evacuate Greece. Your division will be the rearguard of the Heeresgruppe.

To make matters worse, not only Romania but also Bulgaria has switched sides and throws its army against our forces. The goal of the division is to reach Skopje in Macedonia. However Bulgarian forces of occupation in Macedonia have cut the road between Vladievci and Strumica. And good roads, roads at all, are scarce in these regions.

You must act swiftly and attack Bulgarian positions so you can resume our fighting retreat to Skopje. You have orders to decisively throw the Bulgarian Army back and in the process capturing vital ammunition and weapons.
