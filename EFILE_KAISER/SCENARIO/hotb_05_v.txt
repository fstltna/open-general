The war in China is over. Empress Cixi and most of the court have fled Peking. Many Qing officers have died, and the people trapped in the legations have finally been liberated. There is still some fighting inside the city, but we'll soon crush all the remaining rebels.

Now we'll occupy Peking. The Chinese government will pay for all the crimes that they've committed and for all the destruction that they've carried out. We'll demand the Empire to pay an indemnity to all the coalition countries, and besides they'll have to punish severely all the officials who supported the Boxers. We'll not allow this madness to happen again.
However, try to control your troops. We've heard that soldiers from other countries are murdering innocent Chinamen, or stealing everything they can from the local population. We must not allow that.

This has been your third successful campaign in just two years. I guess that you're looking forward to the day when you'll return to America. Well, I've got good news for you. Your request has been granted, and one of our ships will take you in Taku in less than a week. You'll be in San Francisco before the end of the summer, but I hope this won't be the last time that we hear from you.
