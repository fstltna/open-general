Campaign's Level of Difficulty
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The above mentioned level of difficulty is determind the following way:

A random player of average skill who does not know the campaign and plays it without a single reload may think that the campaign is easy or medium or hard to play. 
Of course there are many things that have to be taken into consideration to determine the difficulty of a certain campaign and different players may experience the level of difficulty differently, so the stated level of difficulty should just be taken as a rough information whether a campaign is easy, medium or hard to play.
