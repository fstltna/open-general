Welcome Herr General.

PanzerGruppe vonKleist has rapidly pushed through Belgium and we are poised to strike accross the Muese into France!

You will join the Center of our PanzerGruppe as we strike at Sedan and secure a large bridghead.

The Luftwaffe is to give us priority of support, but it is good to see your own planes in the sky too The RAF has been very active and could show up anywhere. 

STAFF INTEL: The French front lines troops are generally poor quality and their supposed readiness level is low, but, however several first class divisions are nearby, we must cross the rivers area quickly.
