BRILLIANT VICTORY

Very well done. The airfields have been recaptured and you have prevented the enemy from crossing the Maas river at Rotterdam. You did well and we have been able to sent 1600 German elite paratroopers to England as prisoners of war. But sadly the situation in other parts of the country is worse. The Germans have broken through in all important regions are raging towards Fortress Holland. Rotterdam has been bombed and the city is in ruins. General Winkelman will sign the capitulation of all Dutch forces in the Netherlands except Zeeland soon. So be quick and go to Zeeland with your men.
