Wieprz, July 4 1915

Continuing the initiative of the Gorlice-Tarnow breakthrough, the German 11th Army (Mackensen) lead elements are approaching Lublin and Kholm from the south.  A strike by the German 8th (von Below) and 12th (Gallwitz) Armies from the north at Warsaw could spell disaster for three of our armies.

Stavka (Grand Duke Alexander) has ordered a fighting withdrawal in Southern Poland:  preparations were made to abandon established  fortress of Novogeorgievsk facing the northern wing of the German pincer.  Dispatching the Guard Corps (Bezobrazov) to Kholm, the 3rd Army was tasked with delaying the 11th Army on the banks of the Wieprz River, while the bulk of the 3rd Army retreated behind the Bug River.

Your forces will be supported by one of the first deployments of Austin armored cars in battle.
