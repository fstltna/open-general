
FONDOUK EL AOUAREB - 3 JAN 1943

After the "Torch" landings the Allies advance into Tunisia in an effort to capture Tunis (and help defeat Axis forces in North Africa); however after battles west of Tunis the advance is stopped. By this time the Allies are moving into southern Tunisia. French units, including your Corps, are assigned to capture lightly defended passes in the Eastern Dorsal range; in early December your Corps captures and garrisons the Fondouk Pass and its closest town - Fondouk el Aouareb. Later in December a small French offensive captures passes north of your position.

Unknown to you, Axis forces are planning a major assault on northern Tunisia in mid-January 1943, Operation Eilboete, which is to be preceeded by a number of smaller assaults, one of which is a plan to recapture and control the Fondouk Pass. On January 3, 1943 German artillery and dive bombers attack Fondouk el Aouareb, followed by infantry and tanks; your orders are to meet the enemy and stop the attack.

Your Free French forces are weaker and less trained than your allies (and the enemy) but you must prove your men can face the enemy and defend the honour of France...

GOAL: Take all VH's!
