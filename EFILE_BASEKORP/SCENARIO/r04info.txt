04. PEREKOP (25 September 19411)

Comrade, although Odessa is still in our hands, the enemy rushes further east. At Kiev we have suffered enormous defeats with the losses of hundreds of thousands of soldiers. But we will continue to resist the invaders nonetheless!

The German fascists now turned their eyes on the Crimean peninsula with the mighty fortress of Sevastopol on it. The Crimea is only connected to the mainland, the Ukraine, with the Perekop peninsula. 24 Hours ago the enemy has surprisingly attacked and almost gained full control of the Perekop peninsula. We must retake Perekop before the fascists are able to pour their reserves into battle and break through. Good luck, comrade.
