August, 5., 1864  Mobile Bay


Dear Friend,
We spend weeks travelling down the Mississippi and once we arrived at New Orleans, we had to board ocean going transport ships. 
I was able to write and send this letter just before we left New Orleans for the Gulf of Mexico. They say we will sail westwards. So Florida is not our destination! It must be Alabama or Texas. 
There are some siege engineers on our ship - does that mean we have to attack fortifications? I hope to receive a letter from you soon, no matter were I will be!

ORDERS:
Bombard the forts with your ships and weaken the defense. Then land your forces on the islands and capture the forts.

ADVICE FROM YOUR OLDEST SERGEANT:
Sir, we should deploy the USS Moose near the front of our line of battle. You know, the good old Moose is not the fastest ship in the Navy...
