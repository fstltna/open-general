Roterturmpass - September, 1916 - TV

Oberstleutnant, your men fought bravely and blocked any reinforcements coming over the Carpathians. We have not been able to defeat the enemy completely, though, and some units of the Romanian Army were able to retreat back over the Carpathians. Nevertheless, Transylvania has been liberated, and soon we will continue our offensive into Romania soon.
