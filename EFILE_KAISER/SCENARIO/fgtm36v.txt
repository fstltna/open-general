Gospodin General-Leitenant, Sharpantier's cavalry has overrun the numerically superior Kurdish forces in the region:  remnants of the Halil-Bei Corps are in full retreat along the entire front.  Again, our forces were not able to reach Urmia in time to assist the revolting Armenians.  The civillian population has suffered tremendously:  47,000 Armenian and Assyro-Chaldeans have been murdered as the revolt was put down by the Ottoman Jandarma forces.

The strategic situation on the Kavkaz Front has become extremely favorable for us:  following the loss of an entire army at Sarykamysh, the remaining Turkish second-line troops have been unable to resist our spring offensive.  The key goal of the campaign remains the fortress of Erzerum, which guards the entrance to Anatolian plains in Turkey proper.  The IV Kavkaz Corps has been tasked by the Front Command with outflanking the Erzerum defenders from the south.  To accomplish this task, Sharpantier's cavalry and the Azerbaijansky Otriad are to march over 400 km to the NW to participate in the Meliazgert Operation, scheduled to begin in June.
