Enough is enough. A despicable terrorist has murdered our heir to the throne, and Serbia is to blame. They will pay for that. Those who sow the wind shall reap the whirlwind. It doesn't matter if Russia supports Serbia. We have powerful allies, too. If Serbia doesn't comply with all our demands, there will be war. If the world thinks that the Austro-Hungarian Empire is a weak, moribund kingdom, then we'll show them how wrong they are.

Some years ago, the campaign "Weltkrieg" gave the players of Open General the chance to win the First World War playing with the Imperial German Army. But, in the meantime, what were the Austro-Hungarians doing? This new campaign answers that question. You'll lead the K.u.K from Serbia to southern France, fighting against the enemies of the Central Powers. In the end, victory can be yours. The soldiers of the King Emperor deserve their fair share of glory, and they will have it. They will be heroes, too!
