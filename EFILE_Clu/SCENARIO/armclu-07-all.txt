During the next few days more german units arrived and were put under command of Colonel Langkeit and 'Kurmark' temporarily grew to one of the strongest units in the entire Eastern Front. Despite that, 'Kurmark' alone had to hold a 30 km front and all efforts to destroy the bridgehead failed.

Next scenario: New units have strength 5 and experience 299! First scenario with Soviet air appearance.
