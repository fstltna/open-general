LOSS

What a disaster, General! Even though the Turks were not able to cross the Canal, they have established a strong position on the eastern shore and will be able to disrupt our supply lines for several weeks, until we have gathered enough troops for a counter-attack. But this may not concern you anymore. 
 I must inform you that you have been instantly relieved of your command. You are called back to London to give a full report of this operation. Lord Kitchener has called you an "example of unbearable military incompetence", so don't expect to see further action in this war...
