Modder River

November 28th, 1899

We have a second chance of stopping Lord Methuen here, at the Modder River. We thought that our trenches, dug on the river shore, would be enough to repel the assault of the Kakies, but they have found a way to cross the Modder and outflank our positions near the town of Rosmead. 
It's time for you to intervene! Gather your troops, repel the British attack and inflict them as many casualties as you can.

Victory conditions:
- Destroy 10 out of 16 British MSUs.
- Your MSU must survive.
- Keep at least one of your VHs.
