Nooitgedacht

December 13th, 1900

Our guerrila attacks have been extremely successful, but the British have found a way to force us to surrender: burning our farms, shooting our cattle and sending our women and children to concentration camps where they'll die of starvation. They want us to know that If we don't give up they'll destroy everything we love.

One of the Kakie units that are being used in those barbaric practices is Clements's brigade. We have been following them for a few days, and now we have a good chance for destroying it. They have camped in a place with water supply, but located at the foot of a mountain that they didn't care to explore. It's the perfect place for an ambush.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.
- Your MSU core unit must survive.
