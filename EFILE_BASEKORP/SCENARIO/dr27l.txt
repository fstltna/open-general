The Falaise Gap - August 1944 L

"The misery around us screams to high heaven. Refugees and soldiers from the broken German armies look helplessly at the bombers flying continuously overhead. It is useless to take cover from the bursting shells and bombs." Kurt Meyer

Complete failure! Tens of thousands of our troops are trapped in the Falaise pocket. Nothing is gonna stop the Allies now from reaching the fatherland.
