Zweite Flandernschlacht - St. Julien

Apr 24th, 1915

When the "Race to the Sea" ended last year and the front stabilized, a salient was formed around Ypern, whose conquer has become a matter of great importance for us. Strategically speaking, there are some small heights there that would be extremely useful as observation points. But its symbolic importance may be even greater. In october thousands of good German soldiers, including young students and other volunteers, gave their lives in this very same area, trying to take Langemarck. It is our duty to avenge them and show the world that they didn't die in vain.

Two days ago we released tons of chlorine gas against the French defences located north of Pilkem, and it worked extremely well. Two enemy divisions either died or had to run for their lives, opening a large gap in the Entente lines. It's a pity that we don't have enough reserves to break the enemy front completely, but with your help we can still take advantage from the use of the gas. Push through the gap, in Kitchener's Wood and St. Julien, and most of the Ypern salient will be gone. But be careful, there are two British divisions in the area, and the surviving French could regroup and counterattack, too.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.
