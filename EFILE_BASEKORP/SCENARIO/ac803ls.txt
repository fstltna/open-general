General!  We heard that you had died in a RAF attack!  I'm glad you are OK.

Our drive from Oslo to Lillehammer was completely stalled!  This along with the terrible Kriegsmarine losses at Narvick the Norwegians are sure to hang on another month or two.

This rugged country held many challenges no?  Alas, the Fuhrer will not accept this explanation.

I am to be transferred to Graffenwoehr for assignment in a training support unit, and I have written orders here for you to return to your home as well..............it would seem our days of command are over.
