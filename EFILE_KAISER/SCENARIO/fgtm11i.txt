Komarov-Tomashov, 5 Sept 1914
Gospodin General-Major, the Austrian 4th Army - in the center of the enemy's advance into Galicia - has captured the town of Komarov and is threatening to break through toward Kowel, a vital railroad junction.  Having eliminated the Austrian threat on our southern flank, Brusilov (8th Army) is pushing toward the Carpathian mountains.  This development places the Austrians here at Komarov in a vulnerable position:  their flanks are nearly exposed.

Our 5th Army (Pleve), having regrouped after the inital setbacks, is ready to check the enemy advance.  You must recapture the lost ground and seize the initiative!  Your division will be deployed with the XXI Corps of the 5th Army.
