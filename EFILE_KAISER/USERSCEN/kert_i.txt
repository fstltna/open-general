Battle of the Garet Plains

March 22, 1912

After the Melilla campaign in 1909, the area patrolled by the Spanish army reached the eastern bank of the river Kert, although due to the rough terrain and to the lack of resources the Spanish couldn´t build permanent positions. 
In 1911 a new rebellion against the Spanish started, this time headed by Mohamed el-Mizzian. After a first attack against a topographic surveying unit in the month of August, the Berber rebels started crossing the river Kert repeatedly in order to harass both the Spanish patrols and their allied cabilas (tribes). 
The Spanish High Command decided to put and end to these attacks, and since october 1911 launched different military operations in the area, which could´t stop the rebellion.
Finally, a huge offensive was prepared in March 1912. If all went well, el Mizzian´s defeat would be definitive.
