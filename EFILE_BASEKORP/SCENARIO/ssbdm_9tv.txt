ILse looked out the window.A beautiful day.A clear Sky over Berlin.Below the Civilians going about the daily chores.She thought of how the Hell must be on the civilians near the Fronts in France,on those in the cities the SS Air Korps was visiting and dropping bombs on.She thought about Children and Babies being killed.'It was a necessity to a Better World' She told Herself.If She was destined to change the 'Rule of Order' and to 'bring Germinia about' there would be sacrifices.Her feelings had to be 'Numbed' in order to do what must be done.She walked to Her desk and took out a letter opener.She called a few People into the room and requested Her Medical Fraus as well.They watched as She spoke and then slowly She pushed the letter opener through Her hand.She grimaced in pain,some in the room wept and try'd to stop Her thinking for the umpteenth time the Fuhress had finally broke from sanity."No don't intervene" the Fuhress stated "this is nothing, I must learn to control all Emotions to lead Us, the SS/BdM.If We as I have seen in My Dreams are to save the World then We must become as hard as the steel Frau 'Krupp is producing Our weapons out of.Our Girls in the Field who see Death must view those Kamrad's dying with not sorrow or pity but with Gratitude for what they had attempted to do.Make the World a Better Place for All".ILse went back to the Window after having Her hand bandaged.She looked to the West "Winston England will Fall"!
