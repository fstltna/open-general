Her General, while you were leading your force with compentence and professionalism there has been a coup.  Der Fuehrer has been placed under arrest and is under heavy guard at Krankenaus  der Judischen Gemeinde in Berlin.  Peace negotiations are under way with the Russians, the Americans and the British.  In spite of your victories we still have no choice but to surrender, but perhaps we can trade that cursed man for a just peace.  Perhaps now this madness can end.

You will be remembered by both your friends and enemies as a great leader however this all ends.  You are dismissed.  Go see to your family.
