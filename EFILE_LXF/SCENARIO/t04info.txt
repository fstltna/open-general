Welcome to Syria, General. As Britain has declared war on us, we are forced to get some men from the Caucasus front to this area. But that will not mean that we won't follow an offensive strategy - your men aren't here for nothing! The British attacked us, but only with secondary units. These attacks were beaten off and this gives us the opprtunity to counterattack. With you and your men, we will dash into British lines! You and your men must dash south, doing so, you will cut off Damascus, from the rest of the British lines. Those traitors, that call themselves Free French, will defend the city to their last breath. The Germans have sent a tank and artillery regiment to assist us. They have promised to send more reinforcements. These countries were once part of the Ottoman Empire, but were lost to Britain and France after the Great War; now the time has come to retake them! Good luck, General.
