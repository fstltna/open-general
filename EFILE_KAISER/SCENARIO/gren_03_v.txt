When the battle was over, the Dervish Army had ceased to exist. With our superior tactics, training and equipment, our victory was complete. Before the end of the day Omdurman was in our hands, and in just a few months we would control all of Sudan.

Behind us, on the battlefield, lay the bodies of nearly 10,000 enemies. They were the fortunate ones. A similar number of wounded Dervishes remained there, too. Most of them were left to die on the sand. 

More gifted writers, like Mr. Churchill, have already published their impressions on the aftermath of Omdurman, so I will not say anything else about the matter. However, I must confess that even today, some of my nights are haunted by the screams of thousands of agonizing Sudanese. I know the madness of the Dervishes had to be stopped, but I wonder if everything that happened was really necessary.

Ironically, Omdurman was a source of great honours for me. I was mentioned in Kitchener's despatches for my resolution in battle, and a few months later I was promoted to Colonel. So there is no doubt that I owe much to Lord Horatio Kitchener. For my sins, that would not be the last time that I would serve under his direct command and witness his ruthless methods.
