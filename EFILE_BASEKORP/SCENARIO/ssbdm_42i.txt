   "That's quite a few Guns Firing" 
  Frau Commander 'Piask stepping out of Her Command tent.The Soviets were cutting loose with another barrage of Big Guns.The SS was held up at the moment waiting for the Air Korps to arrive.Moments later it did.Piask thought She had seen something but She was even in for a Bigger show.The Sky started to have the Black specks of aa fire show up and it increased til it was not specks but the whole Skyline."Dam they must have a Thousand Guns there" Piask commented.The SS Planes now came flying out of the area with most trailing smoke or fire.Some crashed a few kilometers away.To the Pilots they had seen flak before but nothing on this level.The Air Korps liasion officer came over to Piask."They've shot down so many Air Korps Command has cancelled further aid for the moment" Major 'Ion reported."I'll  contact Berlin about that,guess for the moment the Panzers will have to work through the area.Going to be a lot less available for further duties after this Shit without aid from above.Those are some Big Guns.Don't imagine the accompanying infantries going to enjoy this either.We got to have this area though.And to think I knew the Girls hated Me for My pushing them,after this I will be lucky I'm not shot by Our own side.Sure wish We was back in France. Russia's going to Bleed Us to Death".
