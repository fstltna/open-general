TACTICAL VICTORY

Perfect! we are now at the gates of the most important soviet Pacific port.   Also more enemies of the revolution have been enlisted to fight the Bolsheviks alongside us. 
Vladivostok is now isolated from other soviet controlled areas, and will soon be in our hands.

The Emperor Hiro-Hito sends his best and most sincere congratulations to you.
