LOSS
--------------------------------
What a disgrace, General! The whole operation failed miserably. The glorious British Army being defeated by a bunch of bedouins is surely not the news our government wanted to hear. At the moment, London is very much preoccupied with the Western Front. Otherwise, such a failure could have already meant you being relieved of your command.

Fortunately, the enemy has been hit hard enough to make him retreat and not exploit our failure. The Senussi seem to gather forces again  50 miles west, at Sollum. We are ordered to follow up and strike again, quickly...
