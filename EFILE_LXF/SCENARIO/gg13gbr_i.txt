Herr General,

Your XIX Corps has been redesignated 2nd Panzergruppe and is to take part in the opening thrusts of the invasion of the Soviet Union as part of Army Group Centre. We expect that Pioneers will be able to build a temporary airfield for the Luftwaffe so they can keep up with your advance and Bridging Pioneers have been tasked with building Pontoon bridges so your troops can skirt to the south and east of Brest to avoid delays.

II Panzergruppe Battleplan:

1. Cross the River Bug at Brest and continue towards Kobryn.

2. Secure Kobryn and the road to Slonim.

3. 31st and 34th Infantry Divisions will assault and take Brest.


Player Note: - Use the Bridging Pioneers of III/34/34th Inf(XII) to cross the River Bug and River Machawic.

Recomended purchase: - Infantry + Upgrades and overstrengthening.

Suggested Core: - 3x Tank, 1x Anti-Tank, 4x Infantry, 2x Recon, 2x Artillery, 1x Air Defence, 1x Fighter, 1x Tac Bomber (Including Protos).

Max Core: - 16x Ground Units.

Good luck.
