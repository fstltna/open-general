Frau General Cupps stepped out of the building."What a Dam mess,the Air Korps letting the Soviets sneak Bombers in here.Ah shit the Top floors gone,all My Dam papers.If this aint a sorry state of affairs.Runner come here,get to the Command at Gertz and tell them I need the K4 papers dealing with 'Enfromm.And don't let no grass grow under Your feet.Hell, Hell,Hell.Look at that,Sydignee's car on it's side.Frau any occupants in it,Just the Driver.Where's the Major,over to the Airbase.For What? To shoot Schellem.Get Your Ass over there and stop Her.If She shoots Schellem the SS flyers will bomb Us".Cupps had officers all around Her asking to do this and that while She surveyed more damage."Sargent You've been pestering Me for 10 minutes,can't You see I'm kinda busy.What the Hell do You want"? "Herr General,the 9th SS stopped the Soviets but they only got 6 Panzers left"."How the Hell the Soviets shoot up that many,never mind.Go over to Gertz and tell the 23rd SS to get here on the Double,the Code word is 'Nietsche.Then get to Plenbosvull and tell the 16th to do the same.How could this day get any worst".At that moment a grenade flew out of a window and landed near Cupps.The Frau Sargent kicked it under a truck.It blew,the Truck filled with ammunition blew.Cupps, the Sargent and the others tossed around like Ragdolls from the blast.Frau General Cupps got up, brushed off Her uniform, "guess I better get My Silly Ass out of view".
