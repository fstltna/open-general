Ramnicu Sarat - December, 1916 - L

Oberstleutnant, your attacks in the Carpathians didn't bring the much needed relief for our troops in the south. The progress we made was in vain, and determined counter-attacks by fresh Russian divisions threw us back to our starting points. We will attack again, but right now our mauled army needs time for rest and consolidation.

The campaign in Romania is far from over, since Russian reinforcements are pouring in day by day. Despite this huge setback, let's hope that 1917 will bring victory to our side and this was the last Christmas that we had to spend far from home!
