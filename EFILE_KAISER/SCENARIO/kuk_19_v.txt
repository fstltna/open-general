It's over, General! The war with Italy is over! The Germans have announced that the Italian government will unconditionally surrender to them. With most of their army pinned in Venedig, and France and Britain bleeding themselves to death in Belgium, the Italians understand that they won't receive any help before we conquer Rom. Any further resistance on their part will just worsen their situation.

We won't be generous with those double-crossing traitors. Venedig will be incorporated, once again, into our Empire, and the Kingdom of Italy will be split into several, independent states. The days of Italian unity are over.

Now that Russia, Romania, Serbia, Greece and Italy are out of the war, France and Britain should have the common sense to make a separate peace with us. Sadly, they're still too proud for that. So we'll have more war. 

In the next days, Germany will start with the preparation of the final offensive against France and Britain. And you'll have to travel very far, to the Middle East. While you were beating all the enemies of the Empire in Europe, the Ottomans, our forgotten allies, were in deep trouble in Mesopotamia and Palestine. I'm afraid that, if we don't help them, Turkey will have to surrender in just a few weeks. That front can't fall. Not now. Go there and save our Turkish friends.
