Withdrawal from Oroquieta

May 6th, 1872

The April uprising has been a disaster. Our troops, disorganized and inexperienced, have been completely defeated by the army of the foreign King Amadeo in Oroquieta. Now it is vital that the legitimate king crosses again the French border with all the possible troops. Liberals may have stopped us by now, but in France we will be able to reorganize and try again in the future.

Victory conditions:
Remove three units from the map, in hexagon (9.1)
Keep at least one of your three VHs.
If you lose your cavalry unit (Carlos VII), you'll lose.

Note: In turn 2 you'll receive reinforcements (mounted scouts).
