This was a close call, Kapteeni!
The 139th Rifledivision is wiped out. But soviet reinforcements were detected close to the front.
If the Russians at our flank had attacked instead of eating sausages and soup - I don't know if we could have held our ground...
But now we can really think about expanding our actions at this sector.
Please be on the alert. Decisive things may happen during the next days.
