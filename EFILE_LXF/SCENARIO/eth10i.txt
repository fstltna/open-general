BATTLE OF GUNU GADU

April 24th, 1936 (Ogaden Region, Hararge Province, Southern Ethiopia)

The Belgian and Turk military advisers had organized a strong and defensive position in the low mountains south of Dagghabur where the Tug Jerrer River joined the Tug Fafan River.  The Turk general Wehib Pasha baptized it Ethiopia's "Maginot Line".

For many months, the Ethiopians had accurately fortified Gunu Gadu and entrenched themselves in a system of caverns dug between secular trees taking advantage of the natural roughness aspect of the ground. The Ethiopian commanders were therefore proud of the fortification that they called it "Hindenburg Line" in homage to the famous Prussian strategist of World War I.

On 23 April the Turks inspected their HALF-PREPARED TRENCHES and machine-gun sites. They anxiously considered the morale of the two Guards battalions that had fled from Gorrahei only six months before.  They thanked the stars of their Gods that the Belgians had gone and that they could count on some stout defenders such as Omar Samanthar and Fitaurari Baade.  A second Dardanelles was hoped for.

Graziani launched his attack on the following day, 24 April.
