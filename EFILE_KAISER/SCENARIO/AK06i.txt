Carniola - October 24th, 1917

Anna, meine Liebste,

I wish we could have remained in Romania for some time, to witness our final victory at the Eastern Front. Instead, the High Command sent us elsewhere. They say we’ve become one of the best German units, and now they need our skills in the Alps, where it all began.

The last Italian attacks at the Isonzo nearly broke the Austrian lines. They barely managed to hold the front, but nobody knows if they’ll be able to resist for much longer. The High Command decided that our allies needed German reinforcements, and we are the ones who were trained specifically for fighting in the Alps, so it was logical that they chose us.

Together, Germans and Austrians will resist the enemy. And, if we use everything that we’ve learnt in these three years of war (and I mean everything) it could even be possible to take the initiative for the first time since Italy betrayed our alliance. I can’t tell you more (spies are everywhere), so you’ll have to wait until my next permission, when we’ll be together and we’ll be able to speak freely. I already long for that moment. I want to see you again, hold you in my arms, and kiss you for hours. But we’ll have to wait a little. Now my attention must be in this horrible and endless war. God willing, it will end soon and we'll never be apart again.

I love you so much,

Hugo.
