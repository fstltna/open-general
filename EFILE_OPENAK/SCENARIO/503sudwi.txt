11. Operation Südwind (Gran Bridgehead) 17-24 February 1945

Budapest has fallen, very few of our comrades managed to break through the Soviet lines. This war is lost. Only the madman sitting in the Führerbunker believes in halting the Red Army. He has ordered an immediate counteroffensive against the bridgehead on the western bank of the Gran. Elements of the 7th Soviet Guards defend the area, and they are receiving more and more fresh reinforcements, while we are putting the last reserves to the front. But orders are orders, and you are German officer. Eliminate this Bolshevik bridgehead!
