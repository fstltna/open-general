
OPERATION EDELWEISS - 5 Oct 1942

HQ Army Group A, Russia
General Wilhelm List

Our offensive in the Caucasus is coming to a standstill. You are being ordered to the Crimean peninsula to intervene in the crucial fight for the Caucasus. You will take the last remaining Russian Black Sea port of Batumi close to the Turkish border in an airborne assault. Our momentum will be regained through the shock and surprise of your paratrooper attack. Our 49th Mountain Corps will advance on Batumi to save your paratroops in time. Good Luck, General!

AUXIN - 2 Air-landing Regiments & 5 Divisions, Air-Support
