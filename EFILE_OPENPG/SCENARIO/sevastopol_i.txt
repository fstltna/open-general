Sevastopol, home of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet, must be taken so that we can begin our upcoming campaign in the Ukraine and the Caucasus without a major enemy fortress threatening our right flank. Sevastopol has been under siege and has been pounded by air and artillery for 5 straight days, but you should expect the entrenchments and forts you attack to be the toughest you have ever faced in the war. You must take Sevastopol and the surrounding objectives by no later than June 23rd or our offensive in the south will be compromised. An earlier completion of your mission will only make it easier to prevail over the Soviets later this year.
