Our assaults were unsuccessful. We had to bypass Krasnoyarsk and split our forces. There were several paths and railroads that crossed the taiga, but they weren't wide enough to allow us to march together. We made different groups, and all of them would have to reach Kansk, where we could regroup again.

Naturally, many people couldn't make it. Some of them surrendered to the Bolsheviks. Others were captured or died in combat. Many others froze to death in the woods, or trying to cross the rivers that we found.

And this is where my story ends. On January 10th, when our column had almost reached Kansk, a partisan sniper shot me in the chest. A few hours later Kappel fell in a frozen river. They took us to a village where they could take care of our wounds, but they were too serious. There was nothing that the doctors could do for us.  Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.

As I'm writing these memoirs, I'm hearing Kappel in the other room. He's had his legs amputated, but the infection hasn't stopped. He'll die in a few days, but he's still giving instructions. He's saying something about assaulting Irkutsk and freeing Kolchak. I don't know what he means. I'm feeling very sick, and I know that I only have a few hours left. All I want is to finish this story before the end comes. People must know what happened. I won't be able to tell anyone, but at least there will be a way to read it.
