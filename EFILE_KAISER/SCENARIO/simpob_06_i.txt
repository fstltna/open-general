Song of the Cossacks: Orenburg

April 17th, 1919

By the middle of April, our offensive was progressing very well. After recovering Sterlitamak, Meleuz and Belebei, Bugulma and Buguruslan were the next important towns that were taken on our way to the Volga. But our advance had some vulnerable points, and Orenburg, on our left flank, was the most critical one.

The steppe cossacks were anxious to liberate their capital, which they had lost in January. Unfortunately, Hetman Dutov's Separate Orenburg Army did not have sufficient artillery, or even infantry troops, to assault a fortified city like Orenburg with any chances of success, so Kolchak decided that part of our Western Army would reinforce Dutov. He knew that the Soviets had two veteran divisions in the area, as well as several units of communist militias, and he didn't want to take any risks. 

Besides, he decided that we'd make the main attack, from the northeast, at the confluence of the Salmysh and Sakmara rivers. The cossacks would support us from the east and southeast, but our staff believed that sending the cossack light cavalry against the Soviet trenches and machine gun nests was suicidal. Thus, the responsibility for taking Orenburg would be ours.
