Unternehmen Taifun ultimately halted at the gates of Moscow, and the subsequent Soviet counter-offensive failed any hope for a fast German victory. Axis forces were thrown back, and the lines held only so-so; many units were trapped in cauldron and pockets.

You weren't bold enough, and the local enemy forces held. This failure is unacceptable and your chances for the promotion are vanishing. At least your services will still be required in the spring when the offensive actions will be renewed. Panzer I tanks will be replaced with new Panzer IIs, highly increasing the mobility of your unit.
