Congratulations, General, you've beaten the Germans one more time. They won't be able to re-establish a stable front line again, and their last chances of a negotiated peace are gone. In a matter of days they'll have to surrender unconditionally. If they refuse to do it, we'll invade their country. One way or another, the war will be over. We've won!

America will leave this war as one of the victors and one of the greatest military powers in the world. Maybe the greatest, since France and Britain have suffered terrible losses. Risking very little, we've won a lot of power. From now on, nothing will be done in the world without hearing our opinion first.

We owe much of that to you, General. You've guided your troops with skill and determination, and you'll be remembered as one true American hero. I know that you're planning to retire, but may I suggest that you start a career in politics? Your country still needs you, and you could make a difference in Washington. At least, think about it.

The campaign is over. I hope you've liked it and thanks for playing.
