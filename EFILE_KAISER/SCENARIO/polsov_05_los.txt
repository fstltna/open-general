You have showed a worrying lack of skill in your advance on the Ukrainian plains. Although you did manage to destroy some Soviet divisions, it took you too long to do so and now the Reds have gathered an incredible amount of reinforcement troops. We'll have to retreat from Ukraine and build a safer defence line towards the west. Anyway, we'll choose another commander for that mission. Consider yourself relieved from duty, General.
