The insurgency at Marash - January 21st, 1920

After three years of fighting in several fronts against some of the most powerful countries in the world, Turkey couldn't resist any longer. The war ended on 30 October 1918, when the Armistice of Mudros was signed. The peace conditions were extremely harsh: Istambul and Eastern Thrace were occupied, and the Empire partitioned. The Ottomans lost all their remaining possessions and political rights in Northern Africa, Arabia and Mesopotamia. Even worse, during 1919 British, Italian, French and Greek forces occupied most of the Anatolian coastal regions.

The Ottoman government was unable to react, bound by the terms of the treaties, and soon some prominent military and political authorities started a revolution to guarantee the independence of Turkey. Since the beginning, one of the most active leaders of the new Turkish National Movement was Mustafa Kemal Pasha.

The armed clashes between the rebels and the occupation forces gradually increased in number and intensity. One of the worst incidents took place in Marash, a town in Cilicia, in southwestern Anatolia, in January 1920. Some weeks before, the Muslim militias had started a riot against the Christian population, mainly Armenians. The French, who had the responsability of securing the peace in Cilicia, quickly sent reinforcements to Marash, only to become themselves a target for the Turkish attackers.
