Herr General: There are 2 ways we can plan to react to the Soviet breakthrough: we can try the mounting of a Relief effort in order to free the now encircled 6th Armee in Stalingrad...or ...we can  commence a direct attack on the Soviet armored spearheads moving towards Kalach from the Chir river. To choose the Relief effort, report northwest to Popoff. To choose the direct attack, head north to Katschalinsky. Good luck Herr General...
