The Poles surprised us and defeated us, reaching Kiev a couple of weeks later. The risk of a new Bolshevik uprising was high, so we had to accept humiliating peace conditions, which included the acknowledgement of the independence of Poland, Belarus and Ukraine.

Ashamed for my failure, I left the army and went back to Samara, where I found a job as a teacher. Luckily, people soon forgot about me. After all, I'm not the first Russian officer who fails at a very critical moment. At least I can proudly say that we defeated the Bolsheviks and that, although the empire has been lost, Russia still has a future thanks to people like me. I did my best to serve my country. I wish I had done it better, but I couldn't. Over time, I have learnt to live with that.
