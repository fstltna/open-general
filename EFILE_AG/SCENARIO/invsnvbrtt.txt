* Invasion of Britain *

1.1

Fictional, yet historically based, thus quite conceivable invasion of Britain

Caesar lands twice in Britain : first in 55 BC, and the second time one year later in 54 BC ...
He gave as his reason that the Gauls would receive military aid from Britain...and indeed, on both sides of the Channel are located identical tribes: for example, the Parisi - from whom the now called city of Paris gets its name - they settled around present-day Paris and in South East England ...

Caesar's campaigns in Britain are to be regarded rather as a symbolic act, than real military action:
in fact Claudius, follower of the hated Caligula and grandson of Caesars heir Augustus, finally conquered England some decades after year zero.

The Romans remain in England for about 400 years: the north, todays Scotland, and the extreme west, today's Wales, were never subdued by them.

After the great German storms in the fifth century, all the Roman legions were withdrawn and the Roman rule ends there forever....at this time, the famous Arthurian legend, begun...

Caesar as well as Claudius landed with their troops at the narrowest spot of the channel to the area of the town Dubris, the present-day Dover...
There settled the Celtic tribe of the Iceni, who   later gained notoriety with their famous queen Boudicca 


MISSION ORDER:

Ave General! Land with your legions to the area of Dubris. Back up the coast and resist all counter-attacks, by Jove!
