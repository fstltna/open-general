The Boulton Paul P.75 Overstrand was the last of the twin-engine biplane medium bombers of the Royal Air Force, a series that had begun during the First World War with the likes of the Vickers Vimy and Handley Page Type O. The Overstrand saw brief service in the late 1930s but by the Second World War only a few surviving aircraft remained in operation with training units.

Operational history
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
The first Overstrand flew in 1933 as the Sidestrand Mk IV, powered by two 580 hp (430 kW) Bristol Pegasus IM.3 engines, instead of the 460 hp (340 kW) Bristol Jupiters in the Sidestrand and was capable of 153 mph (246 km/h). The bomb load was also increased to 1,500 lb (680 kg). The conversion was a success and three more Sidestrands were modified using the 580 hp (430 kW) Bristol Pegasus II.M3. 24 Overstrands were produced and in 1936 began replacing the Sidestrand in No. 101 Squadron RAF, the only Sidestrand squadron) and briefly in No. 144 Squadron RAF, being replaced by Bristol Blenheims in 1938. At the outbreak of the Second World War, eleven Overstrands remained in service and six were used for gunnery training. They remained in operation until May 1941, though flying was limited following the mid-air breakup of Overstrand K8173 on 22 April 1940. Plans were made to develop a version with retractable undercarriage as the P.80 "Superstrand" but the project was abandoned.
