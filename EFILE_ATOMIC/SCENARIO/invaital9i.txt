Orders:

We broke through the enemy's lines and the Germans are in full retreat. We should try keep the momentum and encircle the german 10th army. It is unclear which units are ahead of us at the moment but the race for Rome is Open! Rome itself has been declared an open city and won't be defended.

You should try to overcome any resistance and liberate Rome as fast as possible!
