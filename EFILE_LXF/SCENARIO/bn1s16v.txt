General Gotthard Heinrici

Respect, General! Pardon, Field Marshal! You drove the Russians back to the River Oder. And more good news! Hitler died in her Reichskanzlei. He chose Admiral Doenitz as its successor and it appears that Doenitz may be able to negotiate a separate armistice with the Western Allies. You saved Germany from the shame of a total defeat. And the people are celebrating you as a hero. Admiral Doenitz ordered you to Flensburg to personally express his thanks.

Thanks for playing the GREEN DEVILS! I hope you enjoyed the campaign and maybe we shall see each other again here, or in another of my campaigns.
