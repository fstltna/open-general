Japanese Campaign 1937 - ????
v2.0

Join the Imperial Japanese Army from the early years of the first conflicts in WWII.  Begin in Asia with China and Manchuria up to the jungle battles in the Pacific islands or to Burma against the Allied forces.  Your destiny as a Japanese general is not still clear.  Will you end your days fighting to save the sacred Japanese main islands or will you help establish Japan as the preeminent power in Asia?
