SITUATION:

Herr General, the situation is critical. The enemy is about to launch an attack on our positions soon. Prepare your troops for a fierce battle and hold the lines, no matter the costs!

ORDERS: 

Stand your ground and hold 7/4/2 VHs after 12 turns for a BV/V/TV.

NOTES:

Your core will consist of two units only throughout the whole campaign. A heavy tank detachment and a HQ (Must-Survice-Unit).

Your army fields two supply/healer units in this scenario as well as a stationary hospital tent. Use them to heal and supply your adjacent units.
