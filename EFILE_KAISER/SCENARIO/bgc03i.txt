2nd Battle of Krithia - 06/05/1915
-----------------------------------------------------
General, during the last days we had to endure a number of Turkish counter-attacks. Fortunately, we have been able to fight them off. Similar counter-attacks were repulsed at ANZAC Cove, so that General William Birdwood, commander of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, has deemed his front sufficiently secure to enable two brigades to be moved to Helles for our next assault on Krithia. The Australian 2nd Infantry Brigade and the New Zealand Infantry Brigade will join you during the forthcoming operation. Other British reinforcements include a Brigade from the Royal Naval Division and the 125th Brigade from the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division. Nevertheless, the men of your 29th Division will once again be at the forefront of the attack.
 
As for the first battle, the plan is for a general advance on a broad front across the peninsula with the French on the right of the line, and our British and Commonwealth troops in the centre and on the left.

Good luck!
