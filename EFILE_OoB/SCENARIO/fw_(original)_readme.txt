At 4.45 a.m. German forces launch a large scale attack on Poland from the north and the southwest without a declaration of war... the invasion has begun!

---Background---

After many tensions, caused by the peace treaties signed with the Allies to the end of the Great War, and after the agressive policy used by Adolf Hitler, Germany finally goes to invade Poland, and re-take the Polish Corridor, and other lands lost in the Polishs hands after the Saint-Germain pact in 1918. The Germans want the revenge over the Poles, and in September of 1939 the invasion begins... however Germany know that France and United Kingdom will go to help the Polish... The campaign should be fast as a ''Blitz''!
The USSR, due to the surprising non-agression pact signed with Germany, is a neutral power for the moment... But the OKH knows that the Soviets will invade the East of Poland as soon as possible.

Poland was finally erased from the maps by Germany and the USSR, lossing around the 25% of his population by the end of the Second World War.


---The campaign---

The campaign can be started in 3 different ways. You will see 3 options in the Campaign roster, on the game. Each one of the three options, (or apariently ''campaigns'') represents a different German Army;
