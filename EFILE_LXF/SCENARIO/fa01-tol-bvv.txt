I'm impressed!  
The Red Air force has been recalled from this sector. Unfortunately this was just a drop in the bucket. 
Nevertheless it is a remarkable present to commemerate our national holiday on December 6th. 
The air defense will now be left to others as I now need you on firm ground - if I may say so. 
You are to transfer to Mid-Finland as a new crisis is at hand.
