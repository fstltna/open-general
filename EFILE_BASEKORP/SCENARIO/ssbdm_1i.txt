"If they want War we'll give it to Them"  
   Joseph Stalin's Armies had not shown the World much up to this point.His victories had cost Him too much men and material especially against the Finns.The 'Boss now decided to step back and evaluate the Soviet Forces which of course let Britian and France breathe a little eaiser.With this would come more purging of the Officers including a few 'Marshals of the Soviet Union.His allie the Yugoslavians attacked the Czech nation quickly over-running the Country except for the Sudetenland while Stalin sat idle.The Brits and French sent troops in from Poland as Fuhress ILse finally had to play Her hand at War knowing Stalin could not be trusted with His word "Has nothing to do with Me".So War between the Frauland and the Soviet Union was tettering to begin.At the War Cabinet meeting in Berlin the question was "If We fight the allie of Stalin surely He will respond and declare War on Us.Are We ready"? The Fuhress answered "No,We are not.But We cannot allow Stalin on Our doorstep as the Poles have and invite Him on in to take Our Reich.Stalin will die by My orders same as Hitler,His only salvation at the moment is time.We'll have to see how it goes,I believe the Girls are ready and If the Enemy wants War we'll give it to Them".
