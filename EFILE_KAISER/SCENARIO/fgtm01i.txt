Nanshan, May 25, 1904
Gospodin Polkovnik, After crossing the Yalu, the Japanese are unloading two more armies from their transports:  each army landing successively closer to Port Arthur.

The Russian command resolved to prepare Port Arthur for a siege and to relieve the encirclement the following winter with an army being transported by railroad across Siberia.  You will participate in the last rearguard action before the ring closes around Port Arthur here at Nanshan.  Use flexible defensive tactics around the prepared defensive positions you have at your disposal.

Note: it is not possible to win this scenario.  Strategically, no victory at the tactical level can prevent the siege.
