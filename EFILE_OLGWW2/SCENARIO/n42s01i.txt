Herr General,

Instead of sending your divisions to Paulus we have decided to send you to this part of the Roumanian sector. Though the Roumanians are tough fighters they do not have any Anti tank capability. You are to secure their positions by integrating your panzerjaeger regiments into their defensive positions.

[ PLAYER NOTE : At the start of this scenario you can deploy a unit. At that moment you should buy your army, so you can deploy it on the deployment hexes. For the composition of this army see the readme file.]
