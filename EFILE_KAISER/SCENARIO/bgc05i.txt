Landing at Suvla - 06/08/1915
-------------------------------------------------
General, you have been given command over the whole landing operation at Suvla Bay, five miles north of ANZAC cove. This area is known to be only lightly defended, so after you have dealt with the Turkish defences at the landing sites, you should advance inland as swiftly as possible and take the hills that overlook the plain - Kiretch Tepe to the north and Tekke Tepe to the east. You also should occupy the smaller hills east of the salt lake. A successful landing at Suvla could achieve in one determined advance what several months of campaigning have failed to accomplish: the Turkish right could be turned and help our comrades at ANZAC to break out and occupy the Sari Bair ridge, the key to the entire campaign.

Several 'New Army' brigades are eagerly waiting to be landed at Suvla, but I am afraid your veteran 29th Division will have to bear the brunt of the attack, since these brigades are totally unexperienced and have never fired a single shot in battle so far.

Good luck, General!
