BRILLIANT VICTORY

Very well done. We have a bridghead on Tarakan and we will not be driven into the sea. However Japanese opposition is growing. After their initial counterattack they have retreated into their bunkers, pillboxes and tunnels and are awaiting you. The fight for Tarakan is not yet over.
