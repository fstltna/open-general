The invasion of Russia will be the largest military operation in history. Your army will spearhead Army Group Center's initial thrust into Russia. You must seize all of your objectives, including the main target of Smolensk, by August 6th. An earlier completion of your mission could allow us to begin the attack on Moscow before the onset of the autumn rain and the winter slows our advance. Rapid and decisive success will be the key to the entire War in the East.
