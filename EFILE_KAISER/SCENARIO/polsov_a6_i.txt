Do you pledge?

July 9th, 1917

On November 5th, 1916 the German and Austrian Emperors granted independence for the Kingdom of Poland. 
The catch was that they needed more Polish soldiers. But according to international law, they could not conscript subjects of the Tsar. Only volunteers could be asked to fight against the Tsar and Russia. And all volunteers have been in the Polish Legions already. So to get the Polish conscripts, the Emperors had to grant independence for the Kingdom of Poland. 
But once the independence was granted, there was no need for the Poles to fight on the side of the Central Powers anymore. 

In July, Polish soldiers had to pledge their allegiance to the Emperors. Jozef Pilsudski  asked his soldiers not to do this?

And what is your decision?

If you agree, you will gain more military experience in the ranks of Polska Si³a Zbrojna - Army of the Kingdom of Poland.
You can also become part of the conspiracy called Polska Organizacja Wojskowa.

If you refuse, you will be thrown into a POW camp and will wait for the fall of both Empires.

Victory conditions: Choice scenario: BV leads to the battle in the winter of 1918. Regular V omits this battle and leads to the battle in autumn of 1918. TV omits both those battles and leads to the new war against bolshevism in 1919. 

Intelligence report: Whatever will be the choice, infantry should be modernized to match the German Army standards..

Good Luck!
