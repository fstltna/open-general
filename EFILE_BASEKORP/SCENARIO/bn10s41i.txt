
WASHINGTON DC - 12 FEB 1944

Harrisonburg, Virginia, United States

Your troops are at the gates of the capital of the enemy! The seizure of Washington will be a psychological blow to the American people and the enemy will do anything to stop you and prevent this shame. In addition to Washington exists another center of the opponent's resistance. South of the capital is the U.S. Marine Corps Base Quantico. Also there, the enemy will probably fight a stubborn battle. Proceed with caution and focus your attack on these two main target. Enemy counterattacks in your flanks are not expected.

GOAL: Take all VH's!

NOTE: All axis nations auxiliaries are under your command.
