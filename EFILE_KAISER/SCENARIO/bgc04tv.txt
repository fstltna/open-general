We have captured some of the Turkish trenches, but this ground could only be gained by ghastly sacrifice. It looks like we're getting into a stalemate position here at Cape Helles. I think there's no chance for us to break the Turkish lines at Krithia...

HISTORICAL OUTCOME:
Following an extended preliminary bombardment, but yet again advancing in broad daylight,  the Allies mades some progress, but a spirited Turkish counter-attack drove the French from the trenches they had gained. The Royal Naval Division was caught in enfilade fire from the right where the French advance had failed and was forced to retreat, causing the whole attack to crumble. By the end of the battle the new front line was a mere 200 to 250 yards in front of the start line, passing through a patch of vines that earned the area the name of 'The Vineyard'. The British alone lost 4,000 casualties in this costly failure.
