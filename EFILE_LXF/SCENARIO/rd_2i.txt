Comrade General, the final approach to Berlin has begun.  The foolish Germans have left the approach through the Seelow Heights minimally guarded by their lightest units.  This is an excellent opportunity for you to further become experienced in mobile warfare, comrade General.  Drive to the eastern edge of Berlin, and crush all those who would oppose the wave of Soviet revolution.
