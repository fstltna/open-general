The spy's information points to a submarine pen in southern Greece. The Soviets are developing new advanced submarines there that could disrupt Allied shipping and bring our war effort crashing to a halt. Unfortunately, Greece is currently being invaded by the Soviets, and our troops are stretched too wide to help them. Take your troops in, destroy those bloody submarines and get back before the main army discovers your force. The French have pledged their navy to assist us in this operation.
