BATTLE FOR BURIE AND DEBRA MARKOS

February 24th, 1941 (Gojjam Province, Ethiopia)

On 6 Nov. 1940, Major Orde Wingate arrived in Khartoum having been sent down from Cairo to work in close liaison with, and as a staff officer to, Haile Selassie. 
The plan then was for the Emperor to cross the frontier. He would be escorted by his own personal bodyguard of noblemen, by the 2nd Ethiopian, the only moderately well-trained refugee battalion, by No.1 Op Centre and by the Sudanese troops of Boustead's Frontier Btn.

The Emperor and his men were flown from Khartoum to the hamlet of Um Idla near the border on 20 Jan. A place Wingate had chosen as being "practically incapable of detection or interception by the enemy". There was not then, nor was there ever be, any question of Haile Selassie leading his troops in person: his person was too valuable to risk. He and his bodyguard of noblemen followed behind where Wingate and others led.

Wingate had reached Um Idla a few days before the Emperor, almost simultaneously with Boyle's 2nd Ethiopian. For this stage of the invasion of Gojjam there was no danger at all. The sole object was to assemble the different entities of Gideon Force in the interior where Boustead's 4 companies were already in position.

The small town of Burie barred the road to Debra Markos, capital of Gojjam. A LINE OF FORTIFIED POSTS stretched behind it towards Debra Markos.
 
Gideon Force moved forward slowly by day on 24 Feb.
