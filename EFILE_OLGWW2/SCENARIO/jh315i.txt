Herr General, the enemy is making a final attempt to break out of the encirclement in Normandy around the key city of Avranches. Your orders are to move swiftly and prevent this outbreak and force the Allies out of Europe. With Fortress Europe secure, and the Luftwaffe's success in dealing with Allied bombing raids, we will be able to build up our forces to invade England next year.
