
FALL OF NAJRAN - 12/10/1312 (2 JAN 1934)

Northeast of Najran, Najran District

Allahu Akbar! You've almost reached Najran, but I fear it is too late. The Yemenis are on advance and already at the gates of Najran. Slow down the advance of the Yemenis a bit, to show that we are not willing to leave the Province without a fight, but retire then. Our King first seeks a diplomatic solution for the conflict to prevent unnecessary bloodshed between brothers in faith.

GOAL: Hold 3/2/1 VH's for a BV/V/TV!
