20. ODESSA 1944 (9 April 1944)

Our winter offensive has brought us on the other side of the Dnjepr River and Kiev has been liberated. Enemy resistance is still present and the fascists are hurt but not dead. Every day resistance increases. We must make optimal use of the momentum, as long as lasts. We will attack near Perekop and force ourselves into the Crimea. Your force will march along the coast and liberate Odessa. 

Although the fascists have had a hard time, they are still able to resist. It is unsure if the enemy decides to defend Odessa. Nonetheless, we demand you take this port as soon as possible, and drive west, if possible up to the Rumanian border. Watch out for experienced elements of elite divisions. The past weeks these have been the prime source of resistance to our advance in the Ukraine. Good luck, comrade.
