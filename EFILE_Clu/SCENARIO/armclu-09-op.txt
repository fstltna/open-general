While 'Kurmark' tried to clear the Reitwein Spur and the Goeritz Bridgehead a new threat appeared. On February 8th the first units of the Soviet 69th Army crossed the Oder and took the town of Lebus. This presented a new danger for the 'Kurmark's right flank. The Soviets strengthened this new bridgehead constantly and Colonel Langkeit decided to eliminate this threat. The attack began on February 18th.
