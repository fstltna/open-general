Are you not excited? This is the last battle, comrade General! The British capital of London lies before our glorious Red Army of workers and peasants.  

However, as I am sure you know, this is not going to be an easy task, da? The pitiful Allied dogs have rallied what remains of their armies inside of London.  Though the British troops would be some threat to us alone, our intelligence reports that veteran Free German and French troops are supplementing the Allied defense force.  No matter.  With you in command, comrade General, the Allies do not stand a chance.  Go, forward! Destroy the Allies! For comrade Stalin, and mother Russia!
