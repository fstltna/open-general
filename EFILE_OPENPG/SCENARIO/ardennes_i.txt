Wacht am Rhein is our best chance to seize the initiative and force the Western Allies to make peace with us. It is essential that you capture all of your objectives by December 31st, or the Allies will be able to move overwhelming forces into the Ardennes to stop our offensive. Brussels is your ultimate objective, but capturing and holding a minimum of four objectives by December 31st could also affect the war favorably.
