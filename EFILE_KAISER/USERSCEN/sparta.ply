Spartakusaufstand - Berlin 

January 5, 1919

General strike in Berlin. The newspaper district in the street "Kochstraße" is occupied and roadblocks are erected. Negotiations between the government Ebert and the USDP fail - Communist Party under the leadership of Liebknecht calls for armed insurrection. This is the scenario in which you find yourself. 

Revolutionary win the battle for Berlin and sparked such a conflagration? Or bring the brigade Reinhard from north, the "Freikorps" from Potsdam and the "Garde-Kavallerie-Schützen-Division" from south, the situation in Berlin under control?

Historically incorrect:
- The participation of "Volksmariendivision" (was in Berlin - but don't want to fight).
- the cavalry Fuerstenwalde and Freienwalde (fictitious forces to compensate).
