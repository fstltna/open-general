"Ah shit did You see that Nelli,the Shell hit right where General Alma was a few minutes ago".The Russian battleship had gave up on fighting the SS/KM and decided before it was sunk it might as well attack the Amphibious Forces that had gotten to shore.SS Frau Major 'Renck commandered a Halftrack. Returning to the position Alma was She found nothing there.She was now in charge.As all SS officers She was capable of course but being 2nd Fiddle the tension was on a different level when the Big Decisions had to be made.Indecision on 'Rencks part was quickly straightened out as a few more Giant Shells went flying over."Give Me the Dam Phone.This is Major Renck,You Assholes out there fishing or something? Are You going to take care of that Dam Soviet battleship or not".A message back from the Pikar Wohr 'It would be taken care of'.A few more minutes of Shelling and then an enormous explosion as the Soviet battleship was destroyed. "Commander Renck, the KM wants to know where You want the Naval support fire".Major Renck now led the 8th SS and Her leadership help defeat the Soviets though as thought it was a Murderous battle on the Ground.In the Air and on the Seas the SS dominated.There would be no Soviet Fleet sailing to Amerika,it was all at the bottom of the Sea.In Berlin the Fuhress got the Final Report on SS Dead and injured.A 'Necessity' had been very costly.
