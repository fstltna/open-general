Tunisian Campaign

Part 3/3 of the "Afrika" minicampaign


A paratroopers battalion holds this airfield and the enemy tries to dislodge them for several days. We must not lose the airfield, as it is our last base for air operations in region. This village blocks the road towards the capital. You'll secure the village and when I say 'secure', I mean 'secure'; not a single English soldier gets behind this line! 

Next: camouflage your tank depot! We've had many cases of lost vehicles during last days, as the men are tired and demoralized and they slack... then they're surprised when enemy dumps the bombload right onto their head.

The longer you'll stay, the better for you and your men. Because - and listen carefully! - the evacuation goes in a snail's pace and there are not enough ships... Understand?

I hope you and your men make it to the port, but now we really need to drive the enemy away."


Victory objectives: Capture the enemy VH.

Hint: Luftwaffe have sent most of its planes into even more endangered sectors. We're not going to get any air support.

Warning: This scenario uses a bit of limited deployment, use the "View the Strategic Map" feature first! Don't let the paratroopers undergo too heavy losses - if you lose three of the "Must Survive Unit" paratroopers, you'll lose the scenario.
