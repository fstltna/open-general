  The Fuhress "this will be a little different" 
 Cambrai in October.The First World War a tank battle took place with the Brits winning here.With the loss of so many Fighters earlier in the month the Brits and French were gasping for air and ILse was closing the lid on the jar so something had to be done.Search the History,drag something out of the past for reverance to make those now fighting think they can have the Glory of the past.The BEF rolled most of their armor into the Cambrai area to stop this pestilence known as the 'SS'.On the other side the SS Frau's were getting more confident now the Air was in their hands.They could not be stopped by the Enemy with the Air Korps overhead.A Harsh winter could slow them down but in the end the SS was going to own France.So Step 1 of ILse's 'New Order' was going to happen,Western Europe in Her feminine hands.So the 'Frau Panzers rode to the engagement at Cambrai.This by far would be their best test on the Ground.
