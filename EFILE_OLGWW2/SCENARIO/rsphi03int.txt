Bataan, the anihilation Pursuit

April, 1942

After our assault on the Philippines in December of the past year, the enemy forces have been defeated, and these islands are clearly into our hands, however, there are still some pockets of enemy resistance. The most of the enemy troops are entretched on the Bataan peninsula, where they are desperately trying to resist our assaults...

Deploy your troops around our lines in the North of Bataan, and kick out the enemy from this part of the Philippines. The annihilation of the allied troops here, means the end of the campaign in the Philippines. Also, our information reveals that the enemy officers are hidden in the Malinta Tunnel, located on the Corregidor Island. Take that island on the South.
