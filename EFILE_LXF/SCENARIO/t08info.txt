10 March, 1942

The Second Battle for Batumi went desastrues for us. Our front collapsed and the Russians almost brought us back from where you started our campaign against Russia with the First Battle for Batumi in 1941. Due to our recently build fortifications perimeter around Batumi, the city is still at in our hands but is being besieged and can only be supplied by sea. Our line at the Coruh river, not far from Batumi, is our current frontline. We have brought in our last armygroup's reserves to maximize our defensive power. Your forces will also participate in the defending. 

The front has been stabilized at the moment, but the Russians will problaby try to break through with a last assault, on both Batumi and the our line at the Courh river. You must prevent at all costs that the Russians gain a bridgehead on our side of the river. Plus you must ensure that we also hold Batumi, so our efforts have not been in vain. This will not be enough, General. How hard it might seem, you must also push through Russian lines and free Batumi of its siege. Only this way we gather the strategic initiative again, so we can begin a summer offensive to conquer the Caucasus! Reinforcements will come, both for Batumi and the the line at the Coruh river. Good luck, General. You will need it!
