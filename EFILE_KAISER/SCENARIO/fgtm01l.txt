Gospodin Polkovnik, the whithering machine-gun fire from your defensive positions has dazed the attacking Japanese hordes, but it has not stopped them.  Climbing over their dead comrades, the enemy relentlessly pushes forward.

You are to retreat into Port Arthur and preprare for the siege.  Your command has been transferred to General Kuropatkin's newly forming Army Group in Siberia.  The aim is to relieve the siege of Port Arthur by a land campaign from the Russian Far East.

Your efforts thus far are being rewarded with a divisional command and the rank of General-Major!
