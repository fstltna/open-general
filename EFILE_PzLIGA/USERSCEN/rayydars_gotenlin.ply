The Gothic Line

Will you, as the Allied commander, achieve a break-through? Or will you, as Kesselring, even succeed in conquering back Florence?

Scenario specifics:
The deployed units are mainly fictituous due to the lack of adequate resources. Only the 'Fallschirm-Panzer-Division Hermann Goering' ('parachute tank division'??? That's pure nonsense already in the German designation) and the 16. SS-Panzergrenadier-Division have participated in the combat in Italy for sure.
