The Reds resisted all our assaults. We tried everything, to no avail, and in the end we had to retire. The offensive against Orenburg was cancelled. 

We had failed. The Bolsheviks were in an excellent position to launch a massive counteroffensive once they gathered enough troops. I believed that it would happen in May. We'd have to do our best to prepare ourselves and defend Belebei and the other towns that we had taken at the start of the spring. Maybe there was still one last chance to stop our enemies.
