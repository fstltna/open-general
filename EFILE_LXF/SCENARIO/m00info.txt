Introduction

Colonel, these times will mark the black pages of our history. In 1938 our beloved country was forced to cede the Sudetenland to Germany in order to prevent war. The Great Powers sold us at Munich. Earlier this year, in March 1939, the fascist forces from Germany overran our country. We stood alone and any fighting would have no meaning in the end. You, and many with you, could do nothing else than flee the country and hope to liberate the mother country some day.

00. An Ill Fated Legion (18 September 1939)

You ended up in Poland where you tried to persuade the Polish government to found a Czechoslovak Legion in exile. Poland was deaf to your proposals. But now the Poles find themselves under German attack and have agreed to found a Legion. The last few days you have been given some rifles but that was all. The German forces have already encircled Warsaw, and now that Soviet troops have invaded Poland from the east, the Polish forces are fleeing south-east towards neutral Rumania. 

You will not serve your country best by dying in Poland or being captured by the Germans. You will join the Polish exodus towards Rumania. Your Legion is located close to the town of Stanislawow, which means you are close to the Rumanian border. German and Soviet forces are likely to converge on the town so make sure you get out on time!
