Przemysl - San river

After the destruction of the Krakow army our mission is to take the Polish Carpats area. The most important point here, is the old city of Przemysl, on the San river. By capturing this city the west bank of the San would be secured. The Polish Carpats Army is entreched here, surely, they will try to make a good use of the mountains and the rivers of this zone to stop us. Fortunately for you, two Gebirsjaeger Divisions are here to help you clearing the area. Luftwaffe bomber units are on the way area to help you in the ground.
