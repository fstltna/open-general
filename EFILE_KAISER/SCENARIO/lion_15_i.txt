Massawa - Aug 2nd, 1919

"For by wise guidance you can wage your war, and in abundance of counselors there is victory"
Prov. 24, 6

The year 1918 was great year for Germany and its allies. Greece and Italy surrendered, and in the Middle East the Ottomans managed to counterattack and recover much of Palestine, Mesopotamia and Arabia. But 1919 was still better. In March, the Germans finally pierced the French defences in the West Front. In May, France and Belgium had surrendered, too, and the survivors of British Expeditionary Force returned to their island. It was obvious that the Central Powers were going to win the war.

Naturally, we wanted to take advantage of that. If we were quick, the Eritrean Red Sea ports could be ours at last. Until then, the power of the Royal Navy had kept us far from the coast, but in the end of July the British warships sailed to the Suez Canal, fearing a German attack on Port Said. Now I could assault Massawa, while the Crown Prince Ras Tafari Makonnen attacked Assab.

I set my headquarters in Dogali, where my father had fought in the past. In Massawa, the Italian ascaris had long deserted. The garrison of Massawa was composed of some terrified policemen and sailors who didn't have been evacuated when Italy surrendered. A group of British sailors were trying to help them, although their morale was equally low. However, the fortifications of the city were still solid, so taking Massawa wouldn't be a walk on the park.

Victory conditions: 
Take all the VHs.
