
BAGHDAD - 3 JUL 1941

Samarra, Iraq

As you know, the campaign against Russia began last week on June 22. We have order to bring the fighting in Iraq as quickly as possible to an end, to establish a threat on the Russian southern flank in Caucasus. Negotiations with the Iranian and Turkish leaders are in progress to allow the transit of our troops.

Unfortunately, the fighting around the RAF base in Habbanyah is still in progress! The Commonwealth troops there, have built up a strong defensive position. But fortunately for us, in Fallujah in the rear of the enemy between Habbanyah and Baghdad a riot broke out and has cut off the enemy supply lines. With Samarra in our hands we are in a good position to exploit this situation and attack Baghdad from the west. Advance with your troops via Al Khalis and Bani Sad to Baghdad and attack the city! This way, we get Baghdad and could encircle and destroy the enemy forces between Habbanyah and Baghdad.

GOAL: Take all VH's!
