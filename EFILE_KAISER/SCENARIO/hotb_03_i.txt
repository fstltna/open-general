Zapote River

June 13th, 1899

After some months of small skirmishes, we can say that Manila is safe. The Filipino rebels don't dare to approach the capital. Now it's time to send some troops to the south and clear the area between Manila and Cavite of enemies. 

Our scouts have detected a large Filipino army at Bacoor and near the bridge over the river Zapote. Move your men there and expel our enemies from the coast. A flotilla of gunboats will help you. Good luck! 

Victory conditions:
- Take all the enemy VHs.
