What you have done today is one of Bulgaria's greatest victories of all time. Not only did you stop the enemy offensive, you have routed its army! Now the Macedonian front is, at last, open for our final offensive. But before, you must secure our left flank at the Doiran Lake. There, the British are preparing a huge assault against our positions. Go and reinforce that sector. With you on our side, we have nothing to fear.
