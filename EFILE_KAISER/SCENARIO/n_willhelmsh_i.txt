Historically: 

In Wilhelmshaven-Rüstringen was founded on 6th November 1918, after a mass demonstration of over 20,000 naval and shipyard workers and other civilians a workers and Soldiers Council, with its executive organ, the so-called Council or the 21.
To Chairman of the Council was appointed Bernhard Kuhnt. The "21er" Council 
took over the power of the fortified towns,the North Sea Station,the encircling land of Oldenburg in Ostfriesland and all the surrounding islands, without resistance of the military station commands and declared on 10 November 1918 in front of 100,000 enthusiastic demonstrators in Wilhelmshaven,
the Socialist Republic of Oldenburg and the deposition of the Grand Duke of Oldenburg.
Under the impression of demonstrations and pressure from the large majority of Members of Parliament,Grand Duke Friedrich August of Oldenburg declared his abdication on 11 November 1918.
The Free State of Oldenburg was therefore declared in the territory of the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg.
As a provisional government was formed a Land-governing-body, to what, among others, the Rüstringer Member of Parliament Paul Hug and Kuhnt belonged.
Kuhnt became president of the new Free State of Oldenburg.
