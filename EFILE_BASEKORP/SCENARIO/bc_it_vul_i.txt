OPERATION VULCAN
April 20th, 1943

We are now ready to launch the final ground attack against German forces in Tunisia, the last holdings of the Axis forces in Africa.  While the 2nd New Zealand Division takes the mountains to the south of Tunis and protects your left flank, your forces will smash through the German defences and capture Tunis and Cap Bon.  Be aware however that seeing as the enemy has no escape route left, he will fight mercilessly and can be expected to resist until the very end.
