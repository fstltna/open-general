Battle for Nanchang

March, 1939

General, Welcome back to China and congratulations on your new promotion.  Your first task as a General of the Imperial Army will be to undertake an assault on to the key city of Nanchang an important crossroads.  It is also a major industrial city and the main port on the Gan River.  It is an enormous river which you will have to cross to assault the Chinese positions in the city.  The Chinese forces have been threatening our communications, troop movements, and our shipping by the Yangtze River with their air units deployed at Nanchang.  Our supply lines in China must not suffer from this menace - otherwise our troops won't receive enough supplies to continue with the advance over China.

The enemy forces will use the Gan River as a big wall, but your artillery detachments should destroy that wall.  The Imperial Navy will send you some support reinforcements by the Gan River in the form of Imperial Navy air units and Special Navy Landing Forces.

Good Luck.
