Beda Fomm - Benghazi

March 31st - 1941

After the first success against the British (and against the orders of Hitler), the situation is turning positive for us. The British are withdrawing thier troops, Mersa el Brega has fallen into our hands, and now we must continue the offensive on towards Benghazi, then later to Mechilli. In this way, Cyrenaica will be secured, and the front lines restored for the moment.
