ROSTOV (6 January 1920)

I bring good news from Moscow, comrade!  The leaders are very happy with your progress.  The fear of a successful army full of horse warriors is excellent propaganda material.  Yet it is not only propaganda!  Your army has not been defeated and is close to dealing another crucial blow to the capitalist's cause in southern Russia!

The momentum still lies with our cause!  The capitalist armies are ever retreating further  south.  Your Army has the opportunity to capture the important communication center of Rostov.  If we control Rostov the Caucasus will also fall into our hands!


Again, comrade, do not watch your back. Only go for Rostov and do not let your troops be stopped by road blocks or anything else important. It is vital that we capture Rostov before the capitalist swines have the time to reinforce the city!
