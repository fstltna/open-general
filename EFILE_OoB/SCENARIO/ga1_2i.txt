Good Morning General
As you know, our current situation in this war is grim: The Germans are steamrolling across Russia, the British 8th army has been pushed back into Egypt, and the enemy is sitting just across the Channel. Since the time is not yet ripe for a full scale invasion of the continent, we have decided to mount a raid on the French port of Dieppe. It is designed to foster German fears of a major attack in the west and compel them to strengthen their Channel defences at the expense of other areas of operations. This will be a good opportunity for us to gain experience in amphibious landings and test new techniques and equipment...Good Luck General...

NOTE: You may give the "Order to evacuate" by capturing the Evacuation hex with your Command ship, when it arrives. Trying to give the evacuation order with any other vessel will NOT work ;-)


VICTORY CONDITIONS: 

Own 2 VHs by the end of the scenario, or give the order to evacuate anytime after the command ship arrives...
