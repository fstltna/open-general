We don't have enough fuel to bring you back to Moscow. Besides, even if we had, the snow has rendered the roads impassable. Your troops will have to spend the winter right where they are.

There is a small town east of your position, it is of no strategic importance and shouldn't be heavily defended. Get your troops there, requisition shelter and food, and dig in for a couple months, till spring.
We need to wait for all that that snow to melt and our supply lines to be operational again before attempting anything.

All the additional units I've told you about will be sent there.



Instructions: Capture the VHs and dig in.
