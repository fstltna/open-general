Smolensk-Drive to Yelnya L
You failed to close the encirclement around Smolensk. The Russian 16th, 19th and 20th Armies escaped and are now blocking the roads to Moscow. Reaching Moscow before winter sets in will be a tough job that is better left to more competent generals than you.

History
When Guderian's and Hoth's troops closed the encirclement around Smolensk, the fate of 100,000 Russians was sealed. The Bolsheviks also lost 2000 tanks and 2000 guns in the Smolensk encirclement.
