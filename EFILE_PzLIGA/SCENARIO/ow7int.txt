Bergen

Herr General, your troops are experimented now in anfibious assaults after the lasts attacks you did. You will make the next disembark with your troops. The mission is to take Bergen, an important norvegian port. The Kriegsmarine will arrive for help you in your attack, and elements from the 69 infanterie division. Im sure, the allies will send troops and maybe, the Royal Navy will come too.
