Commander, the time has finally come.  The Soviets have launched a fierce counterattack on the German field marshal Erwin Rommel's forces, and crushed them into the snow.  French forces have withdrawn from the area, citing "a lack of proper supplies" as the reason for their withdrawal.  After reviewing your past performances, it has been decided.  You will lead the final attack on the Soviet capital of Moscow.  End Stalin's Iron Curtain over Eastern Europe and take the entire city, including the Kremlin. Communism dies here, Commander.  Show no pity. No remorse.
