Despite fierce resistance, Yelnya is again ours. Your's and Rokossovsky's success at Yelnya has been the only bright spot against the German invasion of our country thus far. I know that you would probably like to continue your westward drive from Yelnya, but Stalin has ordered the Reserve front onto the defensive, and has summoned you to the Kremlin. I have a feeling that he would like you to take over the defence of Leningrad from Marshal Voroshilov, whose performance has been deemed as so incompetent, that now there is a real threat that our Northern capital will fall!
