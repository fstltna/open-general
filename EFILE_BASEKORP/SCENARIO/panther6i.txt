Unternehmen Doppelkopf (18 Aug 1944)
Third part of the "Defending The Reich" minicampaign.

STRATEGIC SITUATION:
By reaching the Gulf of Riga, Soviet summer offensive cut off the lines between Army Group North and Army Group Centre. This is a major disaster, and the connection must be renewed immediatelly. That's the goal of the hastily planned offensive and you'll take a part in it.

TACTICAL ORDERS:
You are spearheading an assault against Tukums, and you find yourself commanded by Der Panzergraf once again. Destroy the Soviet forces and clear the area so that a save corridor between Third Panzer Army and Sixteenth Army can be established and held.

RECONNAISSANCE:
Enemy advance lost the momentum and the Soviets entrenched themselves in a firm line copying the major rivers, with the main centres in nearby cities and ports. They have numerous artillery pieces, including the heaviest anti-tank cannons, and their air support has overwhelming numerical superiority that the few tired and thinly-spread Luftwaffe newbies cannot contest.

NOTE: Be careful when assaulting the river crossings, one crumbled bridge can severely slow down the offensive.

VICTORY CONDITIONS:
At the end of the 16th turn hold the required number of Victory Hexes to claim the corresponding victory.
