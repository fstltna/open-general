We underestimated the Spanish army. They really know how to fight, and we're lucky that they finally decided to retreat in order once they learnt that they wouldn't receive any reinforcements from Santiago. 

We could have run into serious trouble if General Linares, the Spanish commander, had decided to help General Rubín, but it seems that Linares is too prudent, and he's afraid of a Cuban attack against Santiago if he takes any troops out of the town. 

Much better for us. We'll have time to recover before resuming our advance. After we take all the hills surrounding Santiago Linares will be trapped there, unable to defend himself, and he'll regret not having been bolder when he had the chance.
