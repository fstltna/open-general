Hope of Gaul
AG version 3.2

You start the campaign as a war chief of the Treveri with battles at the frontiers against the Teutons. These old enemies again and again try to invade our fertile country.
Later you will have to defend Gaul against the worst of all intruders: Rome.
But the hope of Gaul has a name:
Vercingetorix.
