
ADVANCE TO SANAA - 19/2/1313 (9 MAY 1934)

Hajjah, Yemen

Allahu Akbar! The Yemeni have entrenched their troops for a last stand in the highlands to bar us the way to their capital Sanaa. The European powers and the Mufti of Jerusalem press for ending the fight and it does not leave much time to create facts. Advance into the highlands as far as possible, so that we own a favourable position in the forthcoming negotiations.

GOAL: Take all VH's!

Main reinforcements:
4th turn - west, motorized detachment (3 units)


STORY: In May 1934, after capturing Al Hudaydah, Saudi forces advanced towards Sanaa, where a battle was expected. The mountains were problematical for their armoured cars and tanks. Neither the British nor Italian forces in the region were expected to intervene. Although the Saudis had better weapons, including tanks, the Yemenis had more experience with mountain warfare.
