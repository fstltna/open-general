Gospodin General-Leitenant, the Turkish 3rd Army dispatched over 110,000 men against our garrison of 65,000.  The initial advance of the enemy caused widespread panic in the rear of the Kavkaz Army, prompting the front command to evacuate the regions of Alashkert and Tabriz along the southern border (our left flank).

Your unflinching defense of Sarykamysh, compounded with the severe cold of the Kavkaz Mountains cost the enemy severe casualties:  the Turks left 7,000 frost-bitten prisoners and nearly 90,000 dead on the frozen slopes of the Araks valley.  The triumph of Sarykamysh will enable offensive operations for our forces during the spring of 1915.
