Once again your XIX corps let us down Herr General, you are now ordered to continue south. Do not fail us again or the end of your command will come swiftly for you.

Initially the Poles did not intend to defend the old fortress of Brest as it was located far from front lines, however Guderian's bold rush to outflank Warsaw ensured it became a pivotal position and it's defence could prevent German forces from attacking further south. It's garrison consisted of the march battalions of the 82nd and 35th Infantry Regiments, newly arrived reservists, several batteries of artillery and some old FT-17 tanks used for training. Guderian tried to capture the town on the run with 77 tanks from the 10th Panzer Division but was repelled by Infantry after destroying all the Polish tanks. The next attack was stopped by 2 Polish tanks sealing the main gate. Finally artillery was brought up within range and the fortress subjected to intense bombardment, followed by heavy street fighting which resulted in 40% Polish casualties and their evacuation on the 17th of September.
