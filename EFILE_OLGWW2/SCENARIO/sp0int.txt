Operation Hercules

July 24th 1942

After the defeat at Tobruk, Rommel had pressured the High Command to plan to take Malta, because for the intended advance to Egypt, they needed to have a secured route of supplies.
Mission: The chosen plan is to use two companies of Brandenburger and a battalion of San Marco to infiltrate in the coast of Malta, meanwhile the Raemcke Brigade and Folgore division will fall on the coast, after that, two infantry divisions will arrive by sea.

Note: You will be compensated with prestige if you are successful, and you can have more chances to invade Egypt.
