STORY

The Soviet Union invaded Manchuria in August 1945 and did not leave until May 1946. They conducted joint operations with the Red Army in August and September including parts of Inner Mongolia, Jehol and Shanhaiguan, which was known as ‘the gateway to Manchuria’. They became more circumspect when United States forces landed in North China and took control of the major ports on the coast and Shandong, Hebei, Tianjin, and Beijing along with Guomindang troops from 30 September 1945. US amphibious ships staged a landing at Qinghuangdao on 27 and 30 October 1945 landing Guomindang and US Army units who rapidly proceeded along the Tianjin-Shenyang (Mukden) Railway. This was the only time that US land forces operated alongside Guomindang personnel in a combat operation.
Moscow subsequently had a pro-Guomindang Policy and ordered Red Army units away from the railway lines. Chinese Communists were removed from power in Manchuria either ‘voluntarily’ or were removed openly by Soviet forces. In this period from mid-November 1945 to March 1946, the Guomindang took control of Manchuria. Guomindang forces retook Shanhaiguan and repulsed a doomed counterattack by Lin Biao’s forces who dispersed into the countryside.
The United States tried to mediate between the Chinese Communist Party and the Guomindang but their efforts were doomed from the start. In December 1945 General George C. Marshall started negotiations between the Guomindang and the Chinese Communist Party to negotiate a ceasefire and then peacefully form an united China. The US Ambassador to China, Patrick J. Hurley, had been openly supporting the Guomindang. It never had a chance of achieving its aims and the talks broke down with the Chinese Communist Party deciding on 18 April 1946 to unify China by military means. Military action by the Red Army against the Guomindang had already occurred from the beginning of April when Communist forces tried to stop Guomindang forces from breaking through to Changchan from Siping. The Red Army units were soundly defeated.
As the Soviet forces left Manchuria they openly sided with the Chinese Communist Party handing over control of a large part of Northern Manchuria to them. The Chinese Communists were not universally welcomed as the Russian occupation of Manchuria had been brutal with murders, rape and looting commonplace, harking back to the White Russian Armies’ actions in the early 1920s. The last Soviet soldier left on 3 May 1946 and by that time it was estimated by using the United States military figures that the Soviets had removed US$9 billion worth of factories and other material. This is a significant figure remembering it is in 1945 dollars.
In May 1946 an offensive by the Guomindang captured Changchan and Kirin. Following a mutually agreed ceasefire the Guomindang used this time to capture almost all of the cities in Manchuria by year’s end. The now renamed People’s Liberation Army used this as a time to recruit, train and rearm its forces ready for the battles to come in 1947.
