ANZAC Breakout - 06/08/1915
--------------------------------------------------
G'day, General! Welcome, to ANZAC Cove! Let me explain to you the plan for the forthcoming operation that hopefully will become the breakthrough in this campaign.

While diversionary attacks will be delivered by the Australians at Lone Pine and at the Nek, your troops will take part in the main attack. Two columns will advance upon the Sari Bair range with the aim of capturing the high ground. The right-hand column will head for Chunuk Bair, the left-hand column for Hill 971 and neighbouring Hill Q. For our advance we will use the "deres" - dried gullies that offer the easiest paths through the difficult terrain. 
Once we have taken the high ground we will be able to link with the landing at Suvla Bay.

Good luck!
