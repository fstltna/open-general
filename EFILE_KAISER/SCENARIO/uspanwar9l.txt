General, you must be ashamed of yourself!

Due to your incompetence, we have lost control over Manila's only source of reliable fresh water. All resistance is futile.

With immediate effect you are dismissed from the army.

Historical background:

Manila's waterworks consisted of a pumping station located at Santolan, There, pumps pushed water through an aqueduct into Manila. The Spanish had built fortified barracks, built of stone, to guard the pumps and the reservoir intended to supply Manila for two days if the pumps failed.

On 2 July, Filipino insurgent troops attacked and seized control of Manila's only pumping station, thus cutting off the water supply to the city. Heavily outnumbered, the Spanish garrison from the waterworks was forced to retreat and fight its way back to Manila. The Spanish lines began firing in the general direction of the Filipino trenches to support Santolán troops' retreat. However, the lack of forces and the distance to the main Spanish defensive line prevented Spanish to try to recapture the waterworks.

From that moment, Manila's water supply depended on rainwater catched and stored in cisterns.
