BRILLIANT VICTORY
------------------------------------
My admiration, General! Your dashing cavalry charge has been the most spectacular one since the "Charge of the Light Brigade" during the Crimean War. Beersheba fell to your brave cavalry men, and with it the whole Turkish Gaza-Beersheba line started to crumble.
Soon, under the danger of becoming encircled, the Turkish force at Gaza city had to retreat.
The gate to Palestine has been opened!
