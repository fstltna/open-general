General!

The British are withdrawing!  Your attack finally forced them back to Tobruk!

General, I appologise for calling you reckless, you seemed almost timid at times...........

Our standing in North Africa is better, General Graziani has been chosen to take Tobruk, you have been chosen for a rather different operation.
