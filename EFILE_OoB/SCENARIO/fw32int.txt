Narew River

The OKH is satisfied with your work in the firsts operations towards Ciechanow. The next mission for you and the troops under your command, is to establish a bridgehead over the Narew river. The river is defended by a defensive line of bunkers, damaged by the Luftwaffe raids in the pasts days, however many of them are still operative, and must be taken before to continue with the advance. The 21 Infanterie Division will arrive from the North to help you, surely the next Sunday. Good Luck.
