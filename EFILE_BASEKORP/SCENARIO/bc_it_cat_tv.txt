TACTICAL VICTORY

Fine performance General.  We've secured the bridge at Primasole and the port of Catania has fallen to us - though not after a tough fight against a crack German Parachute Division.  The advance will continue on up the coast to Messina, however your unit has been withdrawn and placed in reserve for future operations.
