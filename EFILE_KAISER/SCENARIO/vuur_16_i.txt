First Battle of Port Elizabeth

March 24th, 1900

The British press says that right now you're marching towards Kaapstad. I guess that they think you're stupid. Attacking Kaaptstad at this moment would be suicidal. The defences of the city are much stronger than Kimberley's, and they have the support of the Royal Navy. There is nothing that we could do there, apart from sending thousands of our brave soldiers to a certain death.

Instead, we'll take advantage of the enemy's fear to lose its capital. While they hurry to Kaapstad they have neglected the defences of Port Elizabeth and Oos-Londen. They still have numerical superiority and more guns, but if we use our troops wisely we can win, cutting all the communication by land  between Milner in Kaapstad and Buller in Natal. I know that you're the right man for this mission.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.
- Your MSU must survive.

Intelligence report:

We have confirmed that the British have built strong fortifications in Port Alfred and Port Elizabeth.
