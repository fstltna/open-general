AC 102 - The Second Battle of Aquae Sextiae

Well, Teutobod, it's time. 

On the hill at Aquae Sextiae Gaius Marius has himselve entrenched. 
Can you show him his limits? - If so, whole northern Italy is ready to be your new home... 

Notes of historical interest:

Marius took up a strong position on a carefully selected hill and enticed the Teutones to attack him there using his cavalry and light infantry skirmishers (most of whom were allied Ligurians). The leading Teutone elements, the Ambrones, took the bait and attacked. They were soon foolishly followed by the rest of the horde. Meanwhile, Marius had hidden a small Roman force of 4,000 nearby. At the battle's height this force launched an ambush, attacking the Teutones from behind, and throwing them into confusion and rout. The Roman accounts claim that in the ensuing massacre 90,000 Teutones were slain and 20,000 including their King Teutobod, were captured. The only surviving reports are Roman, but certainly the complete annihilation of the Teutones and Ambrones speaks to the crushing nature of their defeat.
