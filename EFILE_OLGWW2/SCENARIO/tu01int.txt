Sidi Bou Zid

February 14th, 1943

We know that you've recently arrived from El Alamein but the severity of the situation right here demands your services.
After the Anglo-American's disembark on the African coasts they'll surround us. Due to our lack of forces we be unable to resist in battle.

Your mission: Show the enemy that we are not defeated, advance quickly towards the interior of Tunisia to create chaos within their armies.
