Battle of Dobrich

September 5th, 1916

On August 27th Romania declared war on the Central Powers and invaded Austria-Hungary. They thought that they would be able to defeat Austria before Germany and us could react. But they were wrong. On September 1st our Third Army, along with German and Ottoman units, attacked the Romanians in Southern Dobrudzha. This is a great opportunity for liberating this Bulgarian region, that Romania took away from us in 1913.
Right now, our troops are about to surrender the fortress of Tutrakan, and yesterday we entered Dobrich, the main town in the region. But we know that nearly four Russian and Romanian divisions are preparing a counterattack against our positions in Dobrich. Your mission is to reinforce them, repel the enemy attacks and secure the area.

Intelligence report: The enemy air force is significantly stronger than in previous battles, so be careful.

Victory conditions: Take all VHs.
