Operation Typhoon - Moscow November1941 L

Your inability to capture your objectives in and around Moscow has led to disaster. The Soviet armies, reinforced by troops from Siberia have wreaked havoc on our overextended and once invincible armies. Fierce Soviet counterattacks this winter have put back our weary troops all along the front. The remaining forces of SS Reich are sent to France to be reequipped. You'll be lucky if they allow you to remain in command of the division.
