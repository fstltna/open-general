Liberation of Edirne - July 22nd, 1913

Two months! Only two months passed by before Bulgaria, Greece and Serbia had a quarrell about their war bounty. But now Bulgaria has bitten off more than she can chew. They haven't recovered from their losses in Kirk Kilisse and Çatalca, and yet they have to send most of their forces to fight Greece and Serbia. The've been forced to leave Eastern Thrace almost undefended, so now we have a good chance to recover what they took from us by force.
Edirne fortress surrendered to the Bulgarians four months ago, after a siege that lasted the whole winter. Our troops there fought bravely, but starving and sick, they finally were forced to give up. Now your mission is to retake the position. 
Most of our former defences are useless now, and the enemy has very little presence in the area, so time will be your worst enemy. You will have to take Edirne quickly, so that we can consolidate our advance before signing a new peace treaty. Quick cavalry units, or infantry with transports, could be useful for that acomplishment.

Orders: 

- Destroy all 3 Bulgarian "must survive" units (MSU).

Special note: There is no possibility to deploy your Hamidiye cruiser, but she will be handy in the next scenario, so you should keep it.
