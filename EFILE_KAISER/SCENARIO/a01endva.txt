OUTCOME

The German juggernaut into the Ukraine was in general unstoppable because the Imperial Russian Army was no more. Only scattered troops were fleeing to safety. Chaos was complete. Kiev was evacuated by the Bolsheviks as soon as the Germans came near.

The Czech Legion was also retreating east to stay out of German hands. The Legion's 2nd Regiment took up positions at the bridges over the Dnjepr River at Kiev and held these for five days, until 3 March 1918, so that the bulk of the Czech Legion could retreat east. The 2nd regiment then broke off contact and joined the Legion again. Kiev was now in German hands but the Czech Legion had escaped!
