Herr General,
Your XIX Corps has been redesignated II Panzergruppe and is to take part in the opening thrusts of the invasion of the Soviet Union as part of Army Group Centre. We expect that Pioneers will be able to build a temporary airfield for the Luftwaffe so they can keep up with your advance and Bridging Pioneers have been tasked with building Pontoon bridges so your troops can skirt to the south and east of Brest to avoid delays.

II Panzergruppe Battleplan:-

1. Cross the River Bug at Brest and continue towards Kobryn.

2. Secure Kobryn and the road to Slonim.

3. 31st and 34th Infantry Divisions will assault and take Brest.


Player Note: Disembark Railgun to use it.
Recomended purchase:- Infantry, Upgrades and overstrengthening.
Suggested Core:- 3x Tank, 1x Anti-Tank, 4x Infantry, 2x Recon, 2x Artillery, 1x Air Defence, 1x Fighter, 1x Tac Bomber (Including Protos).
**Top-left hexes are named with the recommended purchase reminder and also a hint about the current scenario.**

Good luck.
