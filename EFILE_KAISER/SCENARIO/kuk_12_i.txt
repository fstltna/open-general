Görlitz-Tarnów

May 2nd, 1915

We fought very hard during the winter, to no avail. The Russian lines held, and besides, Premissel fell in March. Since the war started, half of our soldiers have died, been wounded, or taken prisoner.

The Germans know that, if things go on like this, we won't be able to remain in this war for much longer, so they've decided to help us. Our spring offensive will be, in fact, a joint Austro-Hungarian-German operation against the Russian left flank, in the Görlitz- Tarnów front. If we succeed, the Russians will have to leave the mountain passes on the Karpaten, to avoid being trapped there. It can be an excellent opportunity to change the course of the war in the east.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.
