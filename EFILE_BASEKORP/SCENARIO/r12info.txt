12. ORDZHONIKIDZE 1 (1 November 1942)

Comrade, the situation at the fronts is critical. We only possess a number of single buildings in Stalingrad. And in the Caucasus Army the German First Panzer Army has  refueled its offensive over the Terek River towards Grozny, and Baku where the oilfields are. After 48 hours of continuous airbombardment, the fascists are storming at the key town of Ordzhonikidze which is a very important communications center. We must deny the enemy control of this town at all costs!

Your force will be divided into two. One group will rush to Ordzhonikidze and garrison the city against the Germans. A second group will take part in a smart counterstrike on the German flank in order to destroy the attacking Germans from behind, or at least make them retreat. Good luck, comrade.

NOTE: There are two deployment areas. One on the northern part of the map and in the eastern part of the map.

NOTE: There are various SNOW hexes on the map. These have the same properties as SAND hexes in the desert. Supplying and reinforcing units on those hexes will never be a 100%.
