Message from General García Aldave's HQ:


It has been a tough battle, General, but our victory is complete! El Mizzian was killed by our soldiers near Kaddur, and after that, the few remaining enemies have fled. Our control over the Kert Valley is complete, and without a powerful leader like El Mizzian, it will take years for the hostile Berbers tribes to recover from this defeat.

In a few months Spain will stablish a protectorate over northern Morocco, similar to the southern French protectorate. I don't think there will be much action near Melilla for a long time.

However the situation is different in the west, in the vicinity of Ceuta and Larache. The High Command has transferred you and your troops to that region, where I'm sure that you will be extremely useful.
