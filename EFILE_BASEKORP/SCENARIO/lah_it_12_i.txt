We are planning to regain the intiative on the eastern front by launching an attack on the 'Kursk salient', codenamed: Operation Zitadelle.  The 1st SS-Panzer Division 'Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler' will be attached to the II SS-Panzer Corps.  We are to advance on Prokharovka and link up with the 9th Army in the north

(If playing with rules, you should purchase another ARTY unit.)
