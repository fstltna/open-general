
BELFORT - 19 JUN 1940

While northern France is being overrun by the enemy, the Maginot Line has almost been cut off from the rest of France. The order for the garrison retreat has arrived too late...

The Maginot Line is being attacked from all sides except one: the Swiss border. Most units will defend their posts until their last ammunition has been fired. Your troops, located north of Belfort, should be able to make it to Switzerland and be interned, at least you are not taken prisoner by the enemy... 

German Panzer Divisions are coming from the south-west towards Belfort. Hopefully the Belfort defenses can hold them up long enough. In front of Colmar the enemy has crossed the Rhine River and is marching into the Alsace. No German attack has been spotted towards Mulhouse. There are French troops scattered all over the place. Your orders are to make it to Switzerland!

GOAL: Reach the Exit Points and retreat at last 6 of your units!
