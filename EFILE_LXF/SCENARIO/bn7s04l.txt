BACKGROUND

Operation Excess was a series of British supply convoys to Malta, Alexandria and Greece in January 1941. The operation encountered the first presence of Luftwaffe anti-shipping aircraft in the Mediterranean Sea. All the convoyed freighters reached their destinations. The destroyer Gallant was lost to Italian mines; and Axis bombers destroyed the cruiser Southampton, and put the aircraft carrier Illustrious out of operation for nearly a year.
