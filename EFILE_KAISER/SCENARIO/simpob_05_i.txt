Rush: the Spring Offensive

March 14th, 1919

As soon as we cancelled our unfortunate winter operation against Ufa, Kolchak's staff started to plan our Spring Offensive. For better or worse, it would start in March. Our supply lines were still a mess, and many of our soldiers didn't have a decent training, but we couldn't wait any longer. 
In the north, our Siberian units would advance from Perm to Vyatka and Vologda, trying to connect with Yudenich and the British near Petrograd. In the south, Dutov's cossacks would attack Orenburg. In the centre, our final mission was to liberate Kazan, Simbirsk and Samara. But first we'd have to defeat the five Red divisions that were deployed between Belebei and Ufa. The good news was that, a few days before they ordered me to attack Ufa, some of our units had crossed the Belaya and had taken positions west of that city, so we had a great opportunity to outflank the Reds and storm their rear.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.
