Herr General,

Now our bridgehead is established over the River Narew it is time to continue our push south towards the goal of Brest. Once again the 23rd Infantry will be in Reserve and will follow you to hold taken objectives or capture bypassed ones. We expect that Pioneers will be able to build a temporary airfield for the Luftwaffe so they can keep up with your advance.

XIX Corps Battleplan: Launch a two pronged attack.

1. Attack east with Infantry and Artillery, re-cross the Narew and secure Bialystok then wheel south to take the towns of Bielsk and Pohranicnaja. We believe these are defended lightly by Reserve Divisions.

2. Attack Zambrow south of Lomza then secure the vital river crossing at Ciechanowiec before the bridge there is blown by the retreating Polish forces. Intelligence reports this area is held by the Polish 18th Infantry Division.

Player Note: Use the Pioneers of III/23/23rd Inf(Res)(XIX) to build a forward Air Base at (19,13).

Recomended purchase: - Artillery, upgrade Tank.

Suggested Core: - 1x Tank, 2x Infantry, 1x Recon, 1x Artillery, 1x Tac Bomber.

Good luck.
