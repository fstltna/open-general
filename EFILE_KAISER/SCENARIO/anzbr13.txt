Urgent brief to Anzac Commander.

You have captured Ziza and a great number of Turkish prisoners. However we have become aware of an offensive by marauding Arabs hellbent on revenge against the Turks. We could get caught up in this and have our push to Damascus halted. Your orders are to rearm your prisoners and defend Ziza!! It is imperitive that you hold all your positions!! Good Luck. (There is only 2 possible outcomes:- Brilliant Victory for holding your 3 Vic Hexs OR Loss for not holding them).
