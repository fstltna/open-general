General, Bravo!

Tobruk is ours!  Your destruction of the British here has set up for future operations in Egypt to be quickly possible.

I wish you could remain with us to lead the invasion of Egypt, but it seems Mussilini has a bigger assignment for you, Malta!

Good luck and God's speed General.
