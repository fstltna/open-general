Herr Feldmarschall, this triumph is a fitting end to our Southern campaign.  Once again your skill has led to victory, and more importantly, you have prevented the Americans from using their "Atomic Bomb."  Their research facility is a gutted ruin.  It is most extraordinary that you were able to capture Knoxville despite this distraction.  We must hope that only one such facility exists.
