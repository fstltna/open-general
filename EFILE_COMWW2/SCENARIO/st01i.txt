Herr General: Originally, the Fuhrer planned to bypass Voronezh in the hopes of trapping the Soviet armies on the open steppe. But when our panzers easily penetrated the outskirts and the Kommandanten radioed for permission to seize the remainder of the area, the Fuhrer allowed the decision to be made by Feldmarschall von Bock!, who chose to press on. Therefore you will now join in with the  4th Panzer Armee in taking Voronezh and all key cities in the area...
