Your first contact with a western army has been successful. Sarrail's army is heading back to Greece.
Unfortunately, we aren't allowed to pursue them. Germany doesn't want to do anything that can be interpreted as a provocation by the Greeks. What a foolish decision! No matter that King Konstantinos is pro-German, Greece is already invaded by Britain and France, and the Greek government will eventually declare war on us, no matter what we do. Stopping now will only benefit the Entente countries. But there is nothing we can do.
