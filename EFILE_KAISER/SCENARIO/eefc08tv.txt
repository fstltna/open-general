TACTICAL VICTORY
-----------------------------------
Our losses have been appaling, but due to your great resolution we finally overcame the Turkish redoubts. Nevertheless, this attack again ended as a great failure. The force at Gaza itself were much too strong to wage an assault against the city, and our forces have been weakened too much, so we can't hold our line against a possible Turkish counter-attack. So retreat to our starting positions is the reasonable choice.

By the way, I heard rumors that General Murray is going to be relieved from his post after these two disastrous battles. Hopefully, our next commander in chief will do better.
