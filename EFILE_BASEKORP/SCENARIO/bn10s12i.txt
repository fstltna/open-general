
RAFA - 26 MAY 1941

El Sheikh Zowaiid, Egypt/Palestine border

Welcome to Asia! Favourable conditions for us - the enemy is without adequate supplies, demoralized and Palestine is the last bastion of the Commonwealth troops on the Mediterranean. At Rafa a new defense line was built, but the defense position is weak and not deep and should not pose a problem for your troops. Break through the defense and advance at Khan Yunis our gateway to Jerusalem!

The Egyptians send us some experienced local scouts - they should help to reconnaissance the defensive line.

GOAL: Take all VH's!

NOTE: All axis nations auxiliaries are under your command.
