Przasnysz, Feb 25, 1915

Gospodin General-Leitenant, following the Augustow offensive, the Germans continue to press our positions along the North-Western Front.  Stavka has begun forming a new 12th Army (Pleve), which will now be employed defensively by the front.  The 1st Army (Litvinov) is in the midst of launching a supporting local offensive to relieve the situation around Warsaw on his left flank.

The German Army Group Gallwitz has attacked Litvinov's right flank at Przasnysz and have defeated the 63rd division, while pushing back the right flank of the I Turkestan Corps (Scheideman).  Without throwing the Germans back to their positions at Mlawa, we have no hope of maintaining this flank of the whole Polish Salient.

North-Western Front (Ruszky) has directed the I and II Siberian Corps to attack the city from eastern and southern directions.  The front must hold, Gospodin General-Leitenant!
