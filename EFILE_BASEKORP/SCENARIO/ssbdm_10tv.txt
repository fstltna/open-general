 "Karla turn the turret to the left there's one trying to get around behind Mikka".The turret on the Panzer turned,2 shots into the Brit Maltilda and no effect."Dam those are hard Bastards to destroy".Next moment the Brit tank took one in the rear stopping it cold."Zena,ah You beautriful darling saved Our asses again"."Look Sebba,Zena's here just in the nick of time".Zena Warburgen,tank destroyer supreme for the SS/BdM.The crews number of kills was approaching 30.Zena's tank moved off.The battle raged for hours with both sides paying a terrible price.Then the Air Korps arrived and in the end few Brit tanks escaped while another gruppen of SS Panzers showed up on the scene.Moving towards Arras Zena's tank was spotted smoke pouring out of the turret and the left tread knocked off.In the woods a destroyed Brit anti-tank gun which got Zena but later was attacked by infantry."Shit Karla they got Zena,what a shame"."Yeh Sebba she's going to be missed by one and all.Sure was a Hell of a Girl.How many times She save Us,about a 100? Frau Major Kitch is not going to enjoy writing to the Warburgens to inform them of Her death,they go back since their early teens"."Karla what has happened out here is not going to be very good news for a lot of families back in the Frauland.Things should be easier in the future,the Brits have spent their Armor and with what the Air Korps did earlier this month the 'Tide has turned in Our favor.It all depends on how hard they push Us from here out".
