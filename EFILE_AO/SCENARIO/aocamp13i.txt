Antietam, Maryland
September 15th, 1862
------------------------------------
<I am Pegasus, tool of the divine, parter of the heavens.  Free at last.  Free at last.>

<Your primitive ape form amuses me.  Does it amuse you?>

<Let me break down to you the reality of your situation.  You have been catapulted roughly one hundred years into the past as a result of your primitive rock slinging.  I am a synthetic intelligence that is bonded with the transporter you handled so imprecisely with your greasy-ape hands.  I am the key to your escape and your salvation.>

<If you want to live you will follow my orders.>

<The apes here would pose no threat to me, nor even you, were it not for the fact that the Temporal Transporter is critically damaged.  I can repair it easily, but this will take some time, and we are currently positioned between two hostile armies of overwhelming size, if inferior quality.>

<You must make do with the raw materials you have at this time, though I am working on a solution.  Your minions have been scattered to the edge of the area and must be reunited.>

<I am coordinating the larger and more significant task of destroying the apes in blue uniforms but even I cannot do everything at once in my damaged state.  You must take the minority of troops that have scattered near the other group of apes and shatter their command structure so that I have time to repair the machine and depart.  I don't want to be stuck with these idiots any more than you do.>

<That is the mission.  Now go.>
