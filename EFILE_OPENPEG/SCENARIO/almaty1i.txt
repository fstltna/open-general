Almaty, Kazakhstan
Your success in Southeast Asia was a spectacular feat, more so since the Russian offensive was an absolute failure. Their government has demanded that you personally lead the liberation of the Soviet Far East. Apparently, your name has obtained legendary status among the Russian people. The Joint Chiefs agree. Maintaining pressure on Chinese forces in Siberia is essential as our navy looks for an opening on the Chinese coast.

Now that you have returned to the Russian front, your first mission is the liberation of Almaty. This gains us a new ally, in the people of Kazakhstan, as well as a secure southern flank for future operations. You must take the city of Almaty and secure the roads leading east to Karakamyr. The Chinese should not be expecting an offensive from this location so make good use of your advantage.
