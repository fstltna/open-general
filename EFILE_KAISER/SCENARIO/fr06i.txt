The First World War - The Race to the Sea - 10th, Oct. 1914

Ma chère Fabienne,

Do you remember M. Robert Esnault-Pelterie, one of the founders of the Paris Air Show? We met him back in 1912 at the show when Europe was enjoying more peaceful times. Six of his airplanes commanded by Capitaine Maurice Précardin are now joining my division to better direct the fire of our artillery. 

We are moving North to prevent the Boche from reaching the channel ports before we do. These ports are vital for the supply of the BEF. Only cavalry is now positioned even more to the North than we are. Cavalry and airplanes will decide if we can keep the British in the war.

ORDERS: Général Bertaux-Levillain, you are ordered to take and hold La Bassée while the cavalry of générals de Mitry and Conneau outflanks the German positions. London busses are transporting British reinforcements to the front. Expect at least a brigade to arrive somewhere tomorrow.

OBJECTIVES: Take all 3 Victory hexes in or before turn 12 for a BV, by turn 18 for a V and by turn 24 for a TV. 
Warning: Giving up the single victory hex that you own at the start will lead to an instant loss!
