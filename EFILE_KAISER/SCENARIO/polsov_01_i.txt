Approach to Wilno

April 15th, 1919

Good morning, Colonel. After the Great War, Poland became an independent republic again. But rebuilding of the state was halted by the Soviet attack last winter. Instead of the roads and towns that needed to be built, the army had to be sent in to stop the Bolsheviks. A few weeks ago the Russians crushed Polish positions near Wilno and took the city. Then they occupied other Polish territories. Now it's time to stop the bolsheviks and take Wilno back. 

Victory conditions: Take all VHs.

Intelligence report: We know there are a few weak Red Army units in the vicinity. Some of these units consist of Poles so you either can expect a tough resistance or maybe even desertions. They are our compatriots after all.  Don't expect further reinforcements! And if you delay your attack too much, you may have to fight off more bolsheviks! 
Our western flank is secured by neutral, and the not especially friendly states of Germany and Lithuania. Do not tresspass their borders! 

Good Luck!
