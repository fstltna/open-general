Our intelligence reports that the Bolshevik leader Stalin has fled Moscow and is reportedly barricaded in the city of Kazan.  Most of the remaining high-grade Bolshevik troops are also in the Kazan region.  Meanwhile Bolshevik troops elsewhere are beginning to surrender.  Herr Feldmarschall, a quick victory here, especially if you capture Stalin, should lead to the Bolshevik's surrender and end this war!
