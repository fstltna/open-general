Tientsin

July 13th, 1900

I didn't expect you to be back so early from your meeting at Hong Kong. It's much better this way. You'll take command of the American troops at Tientsin.

The situation here was worsened since you went to Hong Kong. The Boxers are determined to exterminate the foreigners and everything that they perceive as non-Chinese. They're murdering all the local Christians that they can find, as well as any Westerner unfortunate enough to bump into them. Rape and pillaging have become routinary, the international legations in Peking are under siege, and now the Qing government is actively supporting those bandits.

Here, in Tientsin, things were pretty bad, too. A couple of days ago the Chinese nearly took the foreign settlements of the city. Even with the combined effort of American, European and Japanese soldiers, we could hardly resist. But now we've decided to counterattack. We're planning an assault inside the walled city of Tientsin. Once we defeat the Chinese army there, the road to Peking will be open. 

We'll have to be careful, though. The Boxers are just scum, but there are some units of the Qing army, experienced and with decent equipment. We could pay a heavy price if we're overconfident. 


Victory conditions:
- Take all the enemy VHs.
