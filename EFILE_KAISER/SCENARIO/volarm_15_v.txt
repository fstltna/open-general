The Bolshevik revolution has ended. They've been completely defeated and most of their leaders, including Lenin and Trotsky, have died or have been taken prisoners. Only Stalin and a handful of others have managed to flee to Finland, but they're too weak to be a problem anymore.

I'm exultant. These past two years have been the hardest in my life, but in the end the Dragon was destroyed. My family and I will be free. Thank God!

That doesn't mean that all of Russia's problems are over. First of all, we have to dedide what kind of country we'll live in. The most obvious option is the return of the monarchy, but most of the Royal Family was murdered by the Reds, so it might be difficult to find an optimal candidate. I think that Grand Duke Cyril is the legitimate heir, but in the past he has behaved as a person unworthy of the title of Tsar.
Second, it's obvious that Russia needs important reforms. Not the revolutionary madness, but the ones that had already started under poor Tsar Nikolay's reign. And third, peace won't come easy. The Bolsheviks aren't a threat now, but in the rural areas there are still peasant uprisings. And we must decide what to do with Finland, Poland and all the other territories of the Empire that have declared their independence. I doubt that we'll be strong enough to subdue all of them, so I'm afraid that we'll have to come to some kind of compromise. Not to mention the interests that Japan, Germany and other countries might have in  Russia.

But if we have overcome the Reds, all the other difficulties can be overcome, too. The sky is still grey, but the storm is passing over. And I am confident that soon the sun will shine over my beloved Russia.

The campaign is over. I hope you've liked it, and thanks for playing.
