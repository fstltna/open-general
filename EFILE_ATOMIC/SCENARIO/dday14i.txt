Situation:

Sir, after we took the Remagen Bridge we now need to cross the Rhine in the north too. With bridgeheads in the north and south we will be able to encircle the Ruhr area, the industrial heart of Germany. Some of your units will cross the Rhine at Remagen and will stay in the south, so your armee won't be at full strength for this operation (Limited Deployment).

British paratroopers await your orders too.

Orders:

Take all VHs.

Please note:

You have to build two bridges on the RIVER terrain hexes in order to cross the river with your ground units.
Engineers will be indispensable! The fast builder attachment will be useful too.

The use of paratroopers is recommended.
