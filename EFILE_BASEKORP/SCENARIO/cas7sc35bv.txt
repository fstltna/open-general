General, even the Admiral was happy with your performance, he said it was quite remarkable how few of your men were sea-sick on the way across. On the other hand, what amazed me most of all was how you managed to fend of the American counter-attack! A very considerable part of the American army was trying to recapture Washington but they didn't manage it!
