Battle of the 100 Regiments

November, 1940

[RINGGG] Alo? general Minamoto speaking... yes, yes... WHAT?... [CCROOCC]

Excuse me, General.  I was talking with the commander from our garrison in Shouzhou.  He was calling for help.  By the looks of it, the communist Chinese guerrillas have begun a coordinated offensive in the North of China.  It is against some important industrial centers, communication lines, and of course, against the coal mines present on this sector.  Your mission is to advance to Shouzhou and save the garrison.  Unfortunately, the garrison at Datong, an important crossroads and railroad center in the North, has lost control of that town.  It is now being controlled by the guerrillas.  Retake Datong and you will be able to use the train to deploy more troops.  Then clear the area of enemy guerrillas.  The intelligence reports indicate that the enemy troops are mainly the units from the communist ''8th Route Army'', from Mao and his boys.

So, CLEAR this area of any Chinese soldiers and General, I'm starting to hate the Chinese!
