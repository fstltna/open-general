OUTCOME

At Bachmatsj the Czech Legion, in cooperation with Soviet Red Army units, stopped the advance of the German Army and could march its way east, out of the German occupied regions of Russia.

Seeing no future staying in Russia, the Czech Legion decided to get out of Russia somehow. Ultimately the plan would be to travel across Siberia, using the Trans-Siberian railway, to reach Wladiwostok and embark to France. In the weeks after the action at Bachmatsj, the Legion was dispersed at the railways between Penza and the Ural mountains.
