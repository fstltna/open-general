Shakhe West, 22 Sept (5 Oct) 1904
Gospodin General-Major, you will take part in General Kuropatkin's attempt to break the siege of Port Arthur.  Fresh troops are arriving by rail through Siberia.

The first stage of our offensive on the Shakhe River will be a flank action by the Dembovsky recon group, followed by the engagement of the whole of the Western Group (Bilderling) against the Japanese 2nd Army (Oyama).

Note: the unit scale has switched to regimental scale, so you are now in command of a division.  A 7-str unit in PG2 is equivalent to 1 regiment.
