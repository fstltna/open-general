Advance Patrols of the 9th Armored Division have reached the hills overlooking the Rhine Valley. They have just radioed that they have spotted a bridge still standing over the Rhine River at the town of Remagen. Commander, if you could capture that bridge, it could shorten the war by months! We might even beat the Russians to Moscow. You must move, and fast, before the Germans have time to destroy that bridge!
