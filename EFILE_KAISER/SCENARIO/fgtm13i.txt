Przemysl, 16 Sept 1914
Gospodin General-Major, following our swift action at Rava Russka, the Austro-Hungarian armies in Galicia face utter collapse.  Pursued by our cavalry, Austrian forces abandoned one of their key fortifications at Lemberg.  The retreat has turned into a rout.  Now the Austrians hope to hold their right wing at the great fortress of Przemysl.  With its ring of modernized fortifications and fielding the mighty 305mm Skoda howitzers, the fortress presents a formidable defensive position.

Three armies are converging on Przemysl:  the 5th from the north, the 3rd from the east, and the 8th from the south.  Our troops have exhausted themselves, and the supply lines have grown thin.  Our objectives are to first place a cavalry screen around the city and then to completely encircle the fortress, preparing it for a prolonged siege.

Your orders are to capture the objectives around the city.  A Brilliant Victory here will allow you to replace your troops for second-line siege troops and to participate in the winter campaign.  Should you choose to conquer Przemysl outright, substantial prestige will be awarded to you from captured stock, but your forces will be given rest during winter.
