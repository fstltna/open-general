Australia Invasion - Adelaide

December, 1942

We have crossed Australia, without any significant resistance, just some kangaroos in the dirty roads of this country hahaha!  Well, now we think the Australians are planning to use the majority of their troops to protect their southeast corner where their major important cities and bases are located:  Adelaide, Sidney, Brisbane or Canberra for example.  Your mission is to get Adelaide.  This will completely cut Australia in two.  Meanwhile, disembark some troops from the sea against Brisbane and Sidney to keep the remainder of Australian troops busy.  Our brave navy will also be here in the Adelaide sector to help you deal with the enemy.
