November 1918 was an extraordinary month. The Polish state was sovereign and united. Unification was great proof of Polish experience and high standards in politics. At the beginning of the month there were half a dozen governments and each one ruled different parts of Poland with different poltical programs. There was also a government in exile, in Paris as well. At the end of the month, there was only one Polish government. All those political changes were done voluntarily and without using armed forces.
This was very different than in countries around Poland.

But the aggressive neighbours tried to exploit the perceived Polish weaknesses and took over the territory. 
Ukrainians were the first to attack. Then, treacherously after signing a border treaty, the Czechs attacked. The Germans, although weak, were a constant danger and the Samogitians created the state called "Litwa". 
But the biggest danger were the communists who already killed millions of Russians and wanted to export communism to Europe, over the dead body of Poland.
