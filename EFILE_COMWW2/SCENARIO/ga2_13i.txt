Herr General, the Hermann Goering and 19th Panzer Divisions have struck the overextended Soviet tank corps northeast of Warsaw. So far, the Soviets have withstood our counterattacks. Now your division, along with the Totenkopf, will join the fight. We must render the Soviets incapable of renewing their drive on Warsaw! Good luck Herr General...
