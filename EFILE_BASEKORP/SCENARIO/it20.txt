FIRST EL ALAMEIN July1 1942

After 8th Army's defeat at Mersa Matruh, its remnants have fallen back to the last defendable position before the Nile Delta: El Alamein. With the Qattara Depression in the South, there is no way around their defences. But once again they have dug themsleves in in far apart brigade size boxes. You are still in command of all mobile Italian forces that are  in pursuit of 8th Army. Your task is to roll up 8th Army's boxes and move to Cairo and Alexandria as soon as possible.

The strength of our allies in the DAK is down to 55 tanks, 54 guns and 500 infantry divided between 15Pz and 21Pz. 90Le has 53 guns and 1700 infantry left.
