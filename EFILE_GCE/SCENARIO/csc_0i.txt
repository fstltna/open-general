The march on Madrid

November 13th, 1936

Buenos dias general!. I have the pleasure to notice you finally the assault on Madrid will start. Your mission is to take all the bridges over the Manzanares river, and to advance following the axis Ciudad Universitaria - Hospital Clinico, and then, on to the center of Madrid...

The enemy forces are mainly militia men, but our spies reports that the communists are organizing regular units. Also some foreing volunteers and CNT forces have been reported on the East side of the city. Be careful, surely the enemy militias will offer a hard resistance on the south neighbourhoods, (mainly inhabited by workers) and we still don't know how good are the foreing volunteers of the goverment.

Buena suerte y viva Espana!.
