Considering the situation, you did well Herr General in escaping a complete encirclement!  Now I must now inform you that the Sturmbrigade Wallonien and the Panzergrenadier-Battalion Narwa are being withdrawn from your division. Wallonien will be sent back to Wildflecken to be reformed, and Narwa will be integrated into the 20th Estonian SS-Freiwilligen-Divison at Debrecia....
