Message from General Berenguer Fusté's HQ:


Your defence strategy has saved a great portion of our army from an imminent disaster. If it weren't for you, most of our forces would have been annihilated, and even Melilla would be in great danger. Even though we have to mourn the death of brave General Silvestre, shot at Annual by an enemy sniper, and the loss of thousands of soldiers, this is a day for hope and relief.

But the war doesn't end here. The Berber rebellion still goes on, and now that they have a brilliant commander I'm afraid that things are going to become difficult.
