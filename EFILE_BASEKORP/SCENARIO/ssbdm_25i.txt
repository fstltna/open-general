 "That's enough move the 36th SS"  11/14/41
 It was something Ilse had told Herself she would not do.The plans the War Cabinet had made would be followed to the letter.Joseph Stalin's attacks around Leningrad now meant Ilse would have to adapt." I have made a error in My judgement of the Russians capabilities" She informed the War Cabinet.SS Frau General Lotte Renveldt was ordered to relenquish the 36th SS Panzers,they would aid the Leningrad forces.Renveldt was pissed of course and filed a complaint to the Fuhress which stated "remember Your arrogance in the meeting at Munich.You said it would only take a few months and the Soviets would be running for their lives.Your overdue My Fuhress.My accomplishments which are Historical here in the Center have been because of the Panzers,the 34th and 36th.Take half of that away and the Center will be as Lenningrad except I cannot hold the immense terroritory I have captured. The Soviets will surely see the empty spaces and flood through.In time We will be chewed to pieces running around as 'Fire Brigades'.I feel You Meine Fuhress have made a grave Mistake.One last thing, enjoy the Soviet Hordes in Berlin for I will be long Dead".The reply from the Fuhress " You forget Our Trump Card Frau Renveldt,the Air Korps".
