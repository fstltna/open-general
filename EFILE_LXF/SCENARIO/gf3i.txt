Sinking of the Glorious - June 8th, 1940

On June 4th, operation Juno was launched to relieve pressure on Narvik's defenders. This morning we have sunk three British Juno ships: the navy oiler Oil Pioneer, the armed trawler Juniper and the empty transport ship Orama. Following those events, the Admiral Hipper and four destroyers left us to refuel at Trondheim. Your ship and the battleships Gneisenau and Scharnhorst continued the search for enemy ships. Lookouts reported what looks like a carrier. Sink it before it escapes! Do not lose any of the capital ships.
