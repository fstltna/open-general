The capture of London went rather well, the British are suing for peace.
Well, some do. The biggest part of their army and the government has fled with the totality of their accursed fleet to Canada. That's good and bad news; Good news because we won't have to confront that fleet right now, and bad because we had hoped a British surrender would eliminate that problem once and for all. Oh well.

In the meantime we need to neutralize their naval base at Scapa Flow, up north, in case they decide to make a comeback. You are to sail to the Orkney Islands and check for any remaining pockets of resistance before our workers arrive; We plan to build a nice German submarine base there, a memorial for our sunken WWI fleet, and a refueling station.

Don't worry, the British ships and land defenses are gone; You just need to make sure everything is safe for our building teams. With a little luck you might catch some stragglers though: Remember, every piece of equipment which doesn't make it to Canada is a headache we won't have in the future. And by "we", I mean you.
