02. SALZACH VALLEY 2 (19 March 1938)

The German offensive directed at the Salzach Valley is being continued. The Germans have failed to capture Salzburg swiftly, but now they have widened the active front all the way south to Bruck! The Germans have concentrated several divisions here, as expected.

After the previous clash the 8th Infantry Brigade is low on manpower but we cannot afford to pull the unit back for refit. It must hold. Elements of 6th Infantry Division from Tirol and the Fast Division have reached the area to defend the Salzach Valley. Your troops must assist them.

You have orders basically to hold the enemy on the right side of Salzach Valley. Plus, because it is our only supply route to Tirol, the important road to it and the cities along the way must be held. Counterattack if needed. As we speak German SS units have captured an important bridge north west of Bruck. Charge!
