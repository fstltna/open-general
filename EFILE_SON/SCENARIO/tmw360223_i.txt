Battle of The Alamo
February 23 – March 6, 1836

In December 1835, Texians had driven all Mexican troops out of Mexican Texas. Less than 200 Texians were then garrisoned at the Alamo near San Antonio de Béxar. On February 23, approximately 1,500 Mexicans marched into Béxar as the first step in a campaign to retake Texas. Following a 13-day siege, Mexican troops under General Antonio López de Santa Anna launched an assault on the Alamo Mission. All of the Texian defenders were killed. Santa Anna’s perceived cruelty during the battle inspired many Texians to join the Texian Army.
