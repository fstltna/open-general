First Ypres - Messines - October 20th 1914

Prince Rupprecht's 6th Armee has slowed the advance of the British II Corps at La Bassee and has stopped the advance of Allenby's Cavalry Corps. The upcoming attack of 6th Armee and the newly arrived 4th Armee of Falkenhayn will break the Entente line from Arras all the way to the coast. Calais and other ports will fall into our hands, the Belgians will be removed from the war in their entirety and the British will be neutralized by cutting their cross-channel supply lines. The war could very well be over before the turn of the year. 

All German Kavallerie Divisions have been put under command of 6th Armee. Their first mission is to occupy the ridge to the South-East of Ypres. The ridge is defended by the British Cavalry Corps. All cavalry will fight dismounted because of the terrain. That gives the British an advantage - they are trained in infantry tactics.

A Jaeger detachment of HKK V and the 7th Kavallerie Division will join your forces two days (about 12 turns) from now.
