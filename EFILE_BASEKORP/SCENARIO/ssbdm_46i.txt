    "An early Xmas present Fuhress,Moscow"!  
  The message from Frau General Martha Frankopplan's HQ outside Moscow.Forces of the SS were ready to move. Recon had showed the Soviets had hardly no Armor and the Big Guns had been silenced. Soviet troops were still there in mass of course but all had been in former Divisions that had been rolled over by the SS before so it was thought they would most likely take off running East when the first Frau's rolled into town with the Panzers.The 'Boss' Joseph Stalin, his wherabouts by Double Agents in the Kremlin reported seemed He had vanished 2 weeks ago so the Soviets were being directed by No-one.A 'fitting End to a Country of Sub-humans' the War Cabinet had responded now that the End of the War in the East was near it's conclusion as far as organized resistance.So according to Ilse the Frauland was on the verge of winning the War leaving only Amerika to deal with and Japan had nearly been too much alone so with SS help it would fold like a deck of Cards.So Moscow first, then the Eradication could start in earnest of those deemed 'Sub-Human' in the Ukraine,Western Europe,London and Other Countries the SS had in their hand.Millions would soon cease to be and so would Mother Russia, it would be part of 'Germania'.
