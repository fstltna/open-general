Planning the next step - July 1915 
-----------------------------------------------------
General,

the GHQ has proposed a new major operation to reinvigorate this campaign. Additional troops will be landed at Ari Burnu in order to support ANZAC in capturing the Sari Bair ridge, the high ground that dominates the middle of the peninsula above the ANZAC landing. Its seizure would threaten the whole Turkish positions to the south of it. This operation will be in conjunction with a fresh landing five miles north of ANZAC - at Suvla Bay - which should eliminate the threatening of the rear of troops taking part in the main attack at ANZAC.

Since our forces here at Cape Helles are to remain largely on the defensive, we could need the help of your veteran troops both at Suvla Bay and at Ari Burnu. You may decide where your men will be more useful.

NOTE:
If you want to take part in the "Landing at Suvla Bay", choose a V by taking the VH "Suvla".
If you want to support the "ANZAC Breakout", choose a TV by taking the VH "ANZAC".
