The First World War - The Miracle of the Marne - 5th, Sept. 1914

Ma chère Fabienne,

You know I have been fighting in many a battle during my career in this brave and proud army, but never before have I experienced such an excitement at the eve of an engagement with the enemy. It is a strange mix of determination and eagerness, with some uncertainty and anxiousness. Our great retreat has finally come to an end, here at the Marne, close to the gates of Paris. I just learned that the enemy's right flank has turned away from our capital and the 1st German Army is marching south. They are presenting us their flank, and we cannot let this chance pass by. The great counter-attack everyone is talking about for days, will finally materialize. Wish me luck, we will need it. La France will need it.

ORDERS: Général Bertaux-Levillain, you are ordered to take part in the attack of General Manoury's 6th Army against the German right flank at the River Ourcq. The 55th and parts of the 56th Reserve Divisions will support you and do their very best, but you may have no doubt that your experienced elite troops will have to be the heart of soul of our attack.

OBJECTIVES: Take and hold 5 VH for a BV, 4 VH for a V and 3 VH for TV.
