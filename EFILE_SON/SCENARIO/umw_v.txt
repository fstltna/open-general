With the defeat of its army and the fall of its capital, Mexico entered into negotiations to end the war. The 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, forced onto the remnant Mexican government, ended the war and specified its major consequence, the Mexican Cession of the northern territories of Alta California and Santa Fe de Nuevo México to the United States. Mexico acknowledged the loss of their province, and the Rio Grande as its future northern national border with the United States. Mexico had lost over one-third of its original territory from its 1821 independence.
