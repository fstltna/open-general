Comrade General, we have finally rid France of the Allied scum.  Unfortunately, the French armies to the south were able to retreat into the mountains of Spain and Andorra, supported by a weak pro-Allied Spanish government.

Stalin has personally chosen you for the honor of leading the assault on Madrid.  This road is the fastest route to the Spanish capital, comrade General.  Intelligence reports indicate that you can expect heavy Allied resistance and attacks from several directions on this road.  End the resistance of the feeble Spanish government, comrade General.
