Le Mans

Jan 11th, 1871

The advance of the Prussian Second Army into Le Mans was delayed by the heavy rains, so the Germans weren't ready for their final assault until January 11th. That gave General Chanzy, the leader of the reformed Army of the Loire, time to prepare his troops for a final stand.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.

Special note:
- Beware of the muddy terrain and the enemy attacks behind your lines.
