Sedan was the most outstanding Prussian victory of the war. In just one day they had captured the entire Army of Châlons, including Emperor Napoleon III. After less than a month of battles, the best French units were prisoners of the Germans or were trapped at Metz.

However, France wasn't going to surrender so easily. As soon as they knew that the Emperor had been captured, some French politicians led by Léon Gambetta dethroned Napoleon III and established a Government of National Defence on 4 September 1870. General Louis-Jules Trochu was the first president of the provisional government. The French, ready to continue the war, ordered the recruitment of new regiments in order to fight the Germans.

The Germans didn't stop their operations, either. Just a few days after Sedan the Meuse Army and the Third Army went on to Paris. By 19 September the encirclement of the French capital was complete.
