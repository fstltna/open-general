You are to sail up the  estuary of the St. Lawrence River and take the city of Quebec. Be careful, your big ships will be very vulnerable in those cramped quarters.

We don't know yet if the Canadians and the British will try to make a stand here, or rather opt for a deep defense; Depending on their chosen strategy you will meet a strong, or a very strong opposition, and keep in mind the Americans will most likely send troops northward to help the Canadians too, in the hope of keeping the war outside of their frontiers.

You'll have to be fast and decisive, Feldmarschall, hit them hard and don't let them bog you down: For every tank or plane we build, the Americans build over a hundred. Even our superior equipment and our very experienced troops won't help us here, our only advantage is the fact they didn't have the time to prepare themselves - yet. So make haste!
