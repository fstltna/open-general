Singapore
We will strike the Chinese army where they least expect it. As our most experienced and decorated commander, you and your troops have been honored with the assignment to free Southeast Asia. Your goal is the liberation of Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and the destruction of Chinese armies in Southeast Asia.   

We must make use of our naval superiority to obliterate the Chinese coastal defenses west of Singapore. A beachhead should then be secured with the initial objective of liberating the island nation of Singapore, followed by a rapid advance up the Malaysian Peninsula. We are coordinating this attack with continued Russian operations in the Urals, so you must act swiftly and advance with fierce determination.
