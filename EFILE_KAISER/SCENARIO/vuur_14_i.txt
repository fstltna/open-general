Pursuing Roberts

March 1st, 1900

The British are retreating to safer positions west of Jacobsdal, where they could regroup and wait for reinforcements. We can't afford to give them a single day of rest. If we don't go after them and defeat them completely, they will eventualy come back, even stronger than before.  You must stop them before they reach the railroad. 

Victory conditions:
- Destroy 15 out of 22 British MSUs.
- Your MSU must survive.

Special note:
The British MSUs have three escape routes: Jacobsdal, the Riet River and the road to Modder River Station.
