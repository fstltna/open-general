Herr General, we are now in a position to begin an assault towards the vital city of Grozny . Your men, along with the 13th and 1st Panzer-Divisions, will cross the Terek and Kurp Rivers, capturing all objectives, and  breaching the Soviet defences, opening a road to Grozny, and thus, to the Caspian Sea Oil reserves. Good luck Herr General...
