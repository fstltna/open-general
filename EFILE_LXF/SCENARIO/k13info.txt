13. NARVA (15 April 1944)

TO: Grossadmiral
SUBJECT: Emergency at Narva

---The war is going less fortunate for Germany than before. In January the Soviets have pushed Armygroup North back from Leningrad towards Narva. Narva is the gateway into Estonia and thus must be held. The Army is sending as many reserves as possible to the Narva sector but most units are still underway. Your Marine Corps must land near Narva and reinforce our lines and keep the line closed. 

The Soviet Baltic Fleet is liberated from its isolation at its home port of Kronstadt and will problaby intervene your landing of your Marines. Intelligence even suggest the Baltic Fleet has send out a flotilla to make an amphibious landing behind Narva. In any case, you are ordered to prevent such landing and hold Narva at all costs.---
