H.R.H. Prince Amedeo of Savoy Aosta

Come in, General! Your troops come at the right time. We could stop a Allies offensive from Sudan. But for weeks we are now already besieged! If Keren falls, Eritrea is lost for us. Push to attackers back and blow up the siege ring around Keren! We count on you!

AUXIN: 7 Battalions
