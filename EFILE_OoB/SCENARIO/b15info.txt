15. HONGORAI RIVER (20 May 1945)

The general advance towards Buin continues as the 15th Brigade takes over from 7th Brigade! The Hongorai River is the next major obstacle in our advance. You will have to advance along the track in the south, also known as the Buin Road, and along the track in the mountains in the north, known as the Commando Road. 

The most suitable crossing of the Hongorai river is expected to be heavily defended by the enemy so you are ordered to cross the river on two other places, north and south of the main crossing. Also, the enemy is known to occupy a ridge in front of the river known as Egan's Ridge. It is without doubt that this position must be captured in order to have safe supply lines. Good luck, commander.
