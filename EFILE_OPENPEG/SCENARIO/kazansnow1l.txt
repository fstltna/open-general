Your foolhardy maneuvering around Kazan was a stupendous blunder that has cost you your command, and which may well cost us the whole of Russia. The People’s Republic of China launched several strikes on Moscow and the armies you failed to stop in Kazan are advancing at a breakneck pace. Caught in the midst of redeployment, the Russians are in no position to stop them. Your defeat has left the President no option but to abandon all forward operations and prepare for purely defensive operations.
