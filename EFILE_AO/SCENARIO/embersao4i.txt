THE BREACH

Ryburn's Diary - September 29th, 2053

"Phoenix is an incredibly charismatic man.  He explained to me today that a state that perpetuates itself solely through force can't exist forever.   I'm not sure I bought all of his rhetoric, but it's clear he wants to help the people who need it.  And I'm just glad to help the only way I know how."

"Our army though, it's ragtag.  Nothing like the kind of equipment I had access to in the Arm.  Luckily Phoenix is on top of that too.   He's sending us to an area deep in the quarantine zone where he thinks we should be able to procure some better equipment.  First we need to breach the government's bunker line, though..."

"Phoenix insists that we should be fine in the quarantine zone; God, I hope he's right."
