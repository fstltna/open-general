02/26/1940   The Battle Of Honkaniemi

Let's get down to the brass tacks, Everstiluutnantti!
Situation report: The Russians have closed in on Viipuri. That's why we plan a tank counterattack at Honkaniemi.
Enemy: Several Infantry divisions and we expect some tank battalions in the area.
Our forces: You command our tanks, Jaakari battalion 3 and your group. Your flanks are protected by the 1st, 4th, 5th and 23rd Divisions.

Destroy the soviet spearheads. We are getting shorter and shorter on supplies and if necessary you may have to disband some units.
