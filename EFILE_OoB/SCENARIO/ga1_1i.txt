Good Morning General. HQ has directed me to inform you that some of your forces are being transferred to Malta to participate in the defence of the island. Latest intelligence indicates that the Axis air attacks are, to some extent, covertly being coordinated from the ground. Find any transmitters and destroy them, along with  ALL the Axis fighters and bombers. The murderous aerial seige of Malta continues, but so does our will to defend this most strategically important island. Malta must not fall to the Axis 
forces. 
Drive them from the skies!
