Kut al Amara - Tactical Victory

Congratulations! You have taken Kut and forced the Anglo-Indian troops to retreat to Basra. 

Historical outcome: With no further hope of relief - a final attempt by the paddle steamer Julnar to reach the town with supplies having failed - Townshend requested and received an armistice pending surrender talks on 26 April.
