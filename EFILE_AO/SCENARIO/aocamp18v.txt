We've taken on the Reds together. We've fought the Krauts long after they should have been taken care of.  We've fought everything from oversized bugs to a deranged robot to our own poor children in a wasted future.  We've even taken on men with muskets; definitely our "proudest" achievement.  

But Commander, I have to say that after everything we've been through together, the last thing I expected was for us to fight our own countrymen.

When we go back, we're burning this thing and everything associated with it.  It's better that the world never know the potential for evil that control over time and space can provide.

It's been an honor serving with you Commander.

Carter out.

AFTER THE END

* The A.O. unit successfully returned their own timeline in 1955 at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds.  The Time Machine was subsequently destroyed by their combined weaponry, and all traces of alien technology were similarly annihilated.  

*The Commander was court martialed for this action, but as the military never found how the Commander and his men had managed to teleport into Aberdeen in the first place or discovered what the Time Machine was, the Commander eventually had to be released without charge.

*Without the Time Machine to spur them on, the Soviets never launched an attack on the Eastern Seaboard of the United States.  The nuclear future had been avoided.

*The A.O. unit was disbanded upon the court martial of it's commander, with most of it's men going to garrison duties in the States or seeking private mercenary work in conflict-ridden Africa.

*Carter lived to the age of 97 and worked as the U.S. Ambassador to Russia from 1990-94.

*The Commander retired from military service immediately after his discharge, and spent the remainder of his days as a recluse in the wilderness of the Yukon.
