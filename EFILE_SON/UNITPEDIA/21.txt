The Hungarian word literally means “Red Cap Infantry”.

It is an Elite Infantry with high attack and defense values and also high initiative. It has three special skills: combat engineer (it ignores the entrenchment of the attacked enemy), it can use rail transport (RTP) and it can attack naval targets.

Originally the soldiers of the 9th Kassai Honvéd Zászlóalj (Battallion) wore red cap. They formed in May 1848, and they was the bravest and most fearless Honvéd battallion during the Independence War. The 3rd Szegedi Honvéd Zászlóalj also had red caps, and they fought alongside the 9th Battallion in the southern front (Bánát) against the Serbian rebels in 1848. In April 1849, the 11th Kolozsvári Honvéd Zászlóalj also got red caps as an acknowledgement of their vailancy.
