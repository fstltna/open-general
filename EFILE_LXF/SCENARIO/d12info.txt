12. TARAKAN 3 (14 May 1945)

STRATEGIC SITUATION:
After the succesful landing at Tarakan we now hold a solid bridgehead. However Japanese opposition is growing. After their initial counterattack they have retreated into their bunkers, pillboxes and tunnels and waited for us to come. US aircraft have bombed the Japanese positions on Tarakan for several days with thousands of bombs and napalm. This will have softened the Japanese positions but we still believe they are strong. We are already using Tarakan airfield but we need to get control of the oil fields as well. You are ordered to secure these oil fields and make sure the Japanese will vanish as a threat on Tarakan.

TACTICAL ORDERS:
The Australian 26th Brigade is deployed west of Tarakan City and will attack north towards to the coast. Your force is deployed on the Australian right flank. You are ordered to take control of the southern penisula. Japanese opposition will be strong and fierce but we believe in your capability.
