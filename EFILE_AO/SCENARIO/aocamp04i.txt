Nov 4th, 1953
White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
We've done it, Commander.  We've traced these six-legged freaks back to their hidey holes.

The nests are located in in the hills surrounding the White Sands Missile Range, which was lost a few days ago after a week and a half of determined resistance.  Flybys indicate the existence of around four nests.  

Air support has finally arrived from Europe, and our high-clearance combat wings will be arriving to support your offensive in a few hours.  Make sure to secure the nearby airfield or you will have no place for them to refuel and resupply.

We considered using a nuke to wipe these bastards out, but a few of our eggheads think it was atomic bomb testing that created these things in the first place.  We also can't afford to let the Soviets know something is going on here in the desert.

Sweep and clear, Commander.  Show no mercy.  We must exterminate these monstrosities before it is too late.

Carter out.
