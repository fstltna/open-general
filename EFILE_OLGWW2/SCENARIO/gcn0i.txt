Irun - Closing the Spanish - French border

Orders from: Pamplona (Navarra) August, 1936

Buenos dias Sr.General!  Our glorious patriotic movement to save Spain is progressing well.  However, we need to do some operations in the northern provinces.  Our attack on Asturias, Santander, Vizcaya and Guipuzcoa (where our garrison has been defeated) have failed miserably.  That ridiculous northern strip of land it's still loyal to the Madrid government!  We can't tolerate this.  While our brave men are battling the enemy at the republic's capital, you will take command of some units and attack at Guipuzcoa.  Some reinforcements will arrive following the southwest axis of Urnieta - Hernani - San Sebastian.  Also some naval units are sailing up from the El Ferrol naval base to support your offensive with their heavy fire power. 

This province is extremely important.  Intelligence shows that the French have been supplying weapons to the Republicans here.  We must close the border with France and stop any kind of aid to the People's Front in the North.  One more thing: be aware that we must not shoot over the French border.  We don't want to supply the French an excuse to give their full support to the Republicans.

Espero los mejores resultados de sus acciones, General.
