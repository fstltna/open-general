Very well done, comrade General. The Italian government has surrendered to the glorious Soviet Union, and in doing so has forcibly expelled all Allied troops from Italian territory.  The Allies, bound by the chains of international diplomacy, have chosen to obey the Italian government's request.  Luckily, the Soviet Union does not abide by this imperialist dogma.
