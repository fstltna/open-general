OPERATION CHARNWOOD
July 8th, 1944

We must now move on to capture the city of Caen.  It has been an objective since day one of our landings in Normandy, and the Germans are still holding onto it.  Also, it is considered vital that we establish a foothold over the Orne River, and taking Caen would give us exactly that.  To assist in this operation, your advance will be preceded by a large aerial bombardment of the German defences.
