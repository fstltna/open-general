Excellent, Feldmarschall, you managed to succeed after all. What a relief.

The Americans seem a lot more aggressive than last year. Also, they might have only second-hand troops and obsolete material left, but apparently they have lots of it. It might be wise not to try any more head-on attacks, at least not without the help of some serious ally.

I'm afraid we'll have to change our plans.
