Karfreit- November, 1917 - BV

The Italian defences have collapsed. We’ve captured thousands of prisoners and our divisions are marching unopposed to Udine. This is our greatest victory in the West since the war started! Now we must continue our advance before the Italians can react. If we are fast enough, we could force Italy to surrender. Yesterday, it was an impossible dream. Now, thanks to you, it’s a realistic goal.
