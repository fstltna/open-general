Campaign in France

Part 3/3 of the "Westfeldzug" minicampaign




I've got strange rumours from the French front. On one hand, it looks like the Frenchmen are on the very bottom and now when most of the Brits have left the mainland, our positions are better. On the other  hand, we've got more and more news about the new French tactic; one that gives our schnelle Truppen much trouble. They've heavily entrenched themselves in every town and village and we can't do much more than sneak through their lines... only to be immediately attacked by reserves. Many times those are armoured. It's really annoying, because the tanks can't waste their time with nests of resistance, but once they get into the 'open', they are constricted between the French 'hedgehogs' and as they now can't out-maneuver the slower enemy tanks, the results of such encounters are very painful. Many experienced men were lost.

We've already fought in these regions during the previous war. There are many Germans lying around. I fear that unless something happens, we'll once again fill those good ol' graveyards with bodies of our boys.

Maybe I've found the solution to our problem. And I'm very interested about your opininon. I believe that the key is in the air. If we can break the French airforce and roam the skies free, than we must breakthrough at any place desired, 'hedgehogs' or not. What do you think?"


Victory conditions: Capture the VHs.


Warning: The enemy is very strong. Expect unexpectable...
