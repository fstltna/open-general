Operation Marita April1941 V
Congratulations! One of your SS patrols entered the city center and has hoisted the Nazi flag atop the German legation. About two hours later the mayor of Belgrade officially handed over the city to Obersturmfuehrer Klingenberg who was accompanied by a representative of the German Foreign Ministry, previously interned by the Yugoslavs. 

At the same time these messages were received on the radio:
During the night the 8th Panzer Division drove into Belgrade, occupied the center of the city, and hoisted the Swastika flag.
With General von Kleist at the head, the 11th Panzer Division has been rolling into the capital since 0632.
