Offensive of Asturias


Santander has fallen. Most of the Basque troops have surrendered to us in the coast town of Santona, opening the door to Asturias, last redoubt of the Republicans in the North. The situation in Asturias is a bit complicated.
General Aranda is besieged in Oviedo since the past year, only supported by a narrow corridor, and some Republican divisions are surrounding the city. Moreover, the enemy is trying to create a defensive line along the Sella river to stop our forces, and, unfortunately for us, the extremely rainy Asturian weather will support them with heavy rains.

Your mission is to break the siege of Oviedo, clear the Southern area (where the most radical milita defenders are placed) and also capture Gijon, the last Republican capital in the North. Some parts of the navy will support you from the coast and also the Legion Condor and the CTV forces from the air. 

Buena suerte.
