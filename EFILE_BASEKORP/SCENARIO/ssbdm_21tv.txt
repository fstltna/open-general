"Commander what if We surrender"? "Are You insane Frau? In France You fought an Enemy who had a little touch of morality.You surrender to the Bolsheviks and You will suffer a fate worst than Death.Imagine 20,40,100 of these Dirty Stinking Animals taking advantage of Your Gender before that Death.No We take Our SS daggars since were out of ammo and fight to the Death.Did You not take an oath to the Fuhress after arriving from Amerika.On that You swore Your Life to defend the Frauland from all enemies who would stand in it's way to acheive the Greatness the Fuhress is leading Us to". "Yes but I never expected to be fighting the Russians,what is a squad of 8 going to do against 200? The Fuhress and Her 'Greatness' is in Berlin all safe and compfy while We are out of ammo and the 8 of Us here.Maybe Your wrong on those Commanding the Soviets out there,maybe they are a decent sort". "This is what were going to do Frau Amerikan". Commander Roche of the 1st SS/BdM 'Ilse' took Her SS daggar out and stabbed the Amerikan Frau in the throat several times."There You Stupid Bitch, We are here to fight until Our last breath and if You are too chicken or want to surrender and not follow orders of Your superiors then Your last breath comes by My hand".So an Amerikan Frau died,the platoon followed Endora Roche and all were killed though some who were injured and immobilized after Hours of being taken advantage of by the 'Animals' in Soviet uniforms.
