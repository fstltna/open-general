Essentially a big ferry barge with a bunch of AA guns (usually two 88mm Flaks and half a dozen 20mm) bolted upon. Its tasks were escort duty, minelaying and shore bombardment.

It's the armed version of the Marinefährprahm, the biggest German landing craft in WWII.
Intially built for the invasion of England in 1941, they saw action in the Mediterranean, Baltic and Black Seas as well as the English Channel and Norwegian coastal waters.
