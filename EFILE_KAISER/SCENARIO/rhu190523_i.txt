Liberating Miskolc

May 23, 1919

Comrade Commisar, tens of thousands proletars joined the Hungarian Red Army. These factory workers are eager to fight against the capitalist marauders and their mercenaries. Though our new red soldiers aren't trained well enough to defeat the Romanians, we are ready to push back the Czechs, who are famous for their low commitment to fight. Comrade, let's liberate Miskolc!
