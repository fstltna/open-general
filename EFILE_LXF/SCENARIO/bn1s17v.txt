General Gerd von Rundstedt

What an important victory! You became a master of combined military operations. Your successes also benefit the parachute corps. The enlistment of further parachute divisions is ordered. The British mainland surrendered, but Churchill escaped to Canada and the resistance will go on from the British Commonwealth and in North Africa. You will go back to Germany for rest and refitting.
