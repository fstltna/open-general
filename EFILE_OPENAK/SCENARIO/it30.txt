GAZA July11 1943

The past months, your troops and DAK have pushed 8th Army accross the Nile and out of Egypt. Your forces are at the gates of Palestine. The Allies are gathering the last forces available in the Middle East to stop our advance. Most of the divisions they are fielding are inexperienced troops that haven't even finished their training.

Parts of the 5th Alpini Division Pusteria have been flown in from Montenegro and are under your command. DAK will operate to the right of your forces (largely off-map).

Your upcoming offensive against Palestine and TransJordan comes a week after our German allies started a major offensive on the Eastern Front. This offensive - code named Operation Zitadelle - might turn the tide of the war. Combined with a succesfull offensive against Palestine and TransJordan, it might convince Turkey to join the Axis and turn the tide of the war.
