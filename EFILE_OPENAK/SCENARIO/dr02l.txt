Student May1940 Loss

Your forces arrived at The Hague too late to capture the Dutch government and Queen Wilhelmina - they managed to escape to England. Fortunately the Dutch have capitulated after the center of Rotterdam was bombed into oblivion by the He-111s of Kampfgeschwader 4. 

HISTORY
After 4 days of fighting, Goering decided to force the Dutch in Rotterdam to surrender by bombing the city. When Generalleutnant Schmidt (9th PzDiv) reached an agreement on the terms of surrender of Rotterdam with it's Dutch commander, it was too late to recall all bombers and Rotterdam city center got hit very hard. The same day, Dutch General Winkelman decided to have all equipment destroyed in preparation for the overall Dutch surrender.
On that May 14th 1940 General Student was hit in the head by a bullet from an SS sniper in Rotterdam. You and your SS friends are very lucky he survived.
