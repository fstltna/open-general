SITUATION:

Herr General, I know that you and your men have not had time even to catch a breath, but the situation here is critical. Buda-Pest is besieged by the Bolsheviks. Your troops must force their way into the city. It is doubtful that our Hungarian allies will continue to fight if Buda-Pest falls. If you can drive the Reds into the Danube, we may stop the Russian Bear from consuming us.

ORDERS: 

Take all VHs in 12/16/20 turns for a BV/V/TV.

NOTES:

3 Air Transports are available.
