Battle of Malka Nidzhe

September 12th, 1916

When we finally convinced our German allies to launch an offensive south of Bitolya, it was too late. Our summer operations were stopped south of Lerin, and now it seems that an enemy counterattack is inminent. 
We know that two French divisions and a Russian brigade are ready to assault Kuckoveni and Banitsa from the south. Meanwhile, two recently rebuilt Serbian divisions are gathering near Gornicevo, in the south-east. Just like you did at the Doiran Lake, you will have to hold our positions, repel the enemy troops and, if possible, make a counterattack. 

Intelligence report: Beware of the enemy air force and mine fields.

Victory conditions: After 20 turns you must hold 5 VHs for a BV, 4 VHs for a V, or 2 VHs for a TV.
