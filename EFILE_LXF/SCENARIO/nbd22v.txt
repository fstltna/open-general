Commander, despite the attempt of the enemy to bring overwhelming forces against you, your men have persevered.  The victory at Hollandia will be remembered as one of the greatest victories in the Pacific war. The losses sustained by the enemy has left Rabaul so weakened that the Japanese are considering abandoning it.  MacArthur is even thinking of nominating you for a Medal of Honor!
