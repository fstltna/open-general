Maybe the hot Italian summer has had a bad effect on you, but your performance has been truly disappointing. However, after your units were retired from the front the Austrians could finally reach the Adriatic and saved us from a humiliating defeat. Italy has announced that it'll unconditionally surrender to us, in the hopes of avoiding Austria’s harsh terms. 

I'm not surprised. The Italians know that, with most of their remaining armies pinned in Venedig, they can do nothing against us and any further resistance will only be a source of unnecessary suffering to them. Naturally, the Royal Navy could evacuate the trapped Italian units, but not before they complete the rescue of their own soldiers in Thessaloniki. And the French could send enough reinforcements by land, but they won't risk weakening their defences at the Western front after the failure of their Spring Offensive. The Italians understand that, before they can receive any real help, we'll be already marching through the streers of Rom.

With Russia, Romania, Serbia, Greece and Italy out of the war it's time to focus on our final offensive against France and Britain. You'll have the honour of leading the main attack, which wil take place as soon as we're ready. But believe me, we won't tolerate more losses.
