Our drive on Messina has stalled due to heavy enemy defense positons dubbed the "San Fratello Line." Troops from the 45th Division are unable to mount an assault until reinforcements arrive.  We are sending you units to break this enemy resistance.  You are in overall command and it is up to you to choose the proper tactics in order to accomplish these goals. Speed is of the essence, because if Patton does not reach Messina before Monty there will be hell to pay.
