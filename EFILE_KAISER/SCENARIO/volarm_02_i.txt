Belaya Glina

June 28th, 1918

In the north the Communists are very busy dealing with the German menace and with the uprising of Krasnov's Don cossacks, so the Red Army of the Northern Caucasus is receiving very little support from their comrades. That has allowed us to retake the initiative.
Some weeks ago the High Command considered the idea of joining Krasnov at Tsaritsyn, but it finally decided that it would be unwise to march to the north leaving a fully equipped enemy army, far greater than ours, on our rear. Before helping Krasnov we must neutralize the Red Army of the Northern Caucasus, that outnumbers us.

Our offensive started on June 23rd. After some heavy fighting our troops took Torgovaya, on the Tsaritsyn-Ekaterinodar railroad, cutting the enemy's communications with Northern Russia. Alas, we had to pay a heavy price for that victory. Many brave soldiers were injured or died, among them the General Markov. The survivors are exhausted and need a relief.
So now it's my turn. While some of our units cover our flanks and rear, my men will continue the main offensive along the railroad. Our objectives are the towns of Belaya Glina and Novopokrovskaya. Once they fall the taking of Tikhoretskaya will be easy, and soon we'll be at the gates of Ekaterinodar once again.

Victory conditions: Take all the VHs.

Special note:
- The unit that takes Belaya Glina will obtain +100 exp.
