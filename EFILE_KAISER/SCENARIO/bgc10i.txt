Hill 60 - 21/08/1915
--------------------------------
General, after our attempt to take the hills of the Sari Bair range has failed, we at least want to consolidate our meagre territorial gains. Hill 60, in the north of our sector, is the last obstacle between us and our troops at Suvla Bay. If you are able to take this hill - thus connecting our troops at ANZAC and Suvla - this would facilitate possible future operations.
The Indian and ANZAC battalions that will support your assault are severely under strength with many of the soldiers wracked by dysentery. So, your men will again bear the brunt of the attack. Break through the Turkish trench lines and storm the summit of Hill 60! 

Good luck, General!
