This victory will be remembered forever among our followers. The republican forces launched their best troops against us, and yet they had to withdraw with heavy losses.
It has become clear that our soldiers can fight on equal terms with the liberals. It's time to leave the mountains and villages and take the war to the great cities of the north. Bilbao will be your next target.
