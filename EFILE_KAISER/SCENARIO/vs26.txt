Fourth Ypres - Battle of Estaires - April 9, 1918

Earlier this year, 50 Divisions were moved to the Western Front after the collapse of the Russian surrender and the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Our first major offensive in a long time - Operation Michael - pushed the Entente forces up to 64km back, but failed to reach a breakthrough. 

Now it is time to try again, here South of Ypres. The objective is to capture Ypres, force the Brits back to the channel ports and out of the war. Your task is to take command of XIX Corps and carry out the initial attack against Portuguese forces occupying the line South of Armentières. Your forces will be relieved once they reach positions 5km North of Estaires. Secondary objectives (gain extra prestige) are Armentieres on your right flank and Merville on your left flank.


Player orders:
- Capture the two Victory hexes in the North. 
- Capture the three British flagged hexes in the West and the one in the East for extra prestige.
