The Boer fought brilliantly a tough defensive battle. We suffered many losses, and we finally had to regroup at our initial positions on the Modder River. That very same week the Boer defeated other British forces at Stormberg and Colenso. After nearly three months of war our Army had been unable to make any significant progress.

But that was soon going to change. General Roberts was appointed as overall Commander-in-Chief in South Africa. He came with General Kitchener as Chief of Staff, and with tens of thousands of reinforcement troops from all parts of the Empire. The days of Boer independence were numbered.

Roberts took command of the Kimberley front. He blamed Lord Methuen for not having defeated the Boer, quite unfairly in my opinion, and he ordered the 1st Division to stand by the Modder River for almost two months. In February 1900 Roberts stripped the Guards Brigade, to which I belonged, from the 1st Division to a new 11th Division under Pole-Carew, and he relegated Lord Methuen to cover his lines of communication. It was a sad destiny for such a knightly warrior, who only happened to have bad luck.

As for our brigade, since February we followed Roberts's advance to Kimberley, and then to Bloemfontein and Johannesburg, but for the next four months our division had a secondary role and we were not engaged in any important battle.
