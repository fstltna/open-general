Mersa Matruh

June 6th, 1942

Congratulations Herr Feldmarshal!!, High Command have prommoted you due to your good actions in the past. Now, the next aim should be the Mersa Matruh area. The enemy is trying to build up another defensive line in this place. The reports are indicating that this time the enemy lines are weaker than in Gazala. On the other hand, the enemy forces are bigger, and surely will outnumber our troops again. The mission objetive is to make a fast assault from the South, like at Gazala, surprising the enemy with our fastest units, and finally assaulting the fortified point of Mersa Matruh.
