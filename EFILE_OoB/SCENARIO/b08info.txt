08. PORTON (8 June 1945)

Although we have cut off the Bonis peninsula, the frontline is still wide. Headquarters fears that a determined Japanese counterattack could break through. There is a possibility to reduce the length of our frontline by moving it forward to a line between the villages of Chindawon and Porton. It would be possible to hold this new line with just a single battalion.

There is certain risks involved in this advance because we have no reliable intelligence concerning the Japanese strenth on the peninsula. So first an amphibious assault will be made with the goal of capturing Porton. As soon as this assault is a success further attacks will be made. You will be given support by HMAS Dubbo and HMAS Kiama. Good luck, General!
