General Alfredo Guzzoni 

Ah General, oh pardon Maresciallo d'Italia! Your promotion just arrived. The Allies landing attempt was a disaster! Now we must use the momentum to make our victory in the Mediterranean area complete! German troops crossed the Suez Canal and could take some key positions in the Near East. Your troops were transferred to this area immediately to support the our advance.
