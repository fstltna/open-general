Choice- What's next?

The historical path of this campaign has finished. Now you must choose if you want to end it, or if you're ready to go on.

If you select the Abyssinian flag, the campaign will end. Congratulations, you'll have won!!!

If you select the Italian flag instead, you'll play seven fictional scenarios, between the years 1916 and 1919. Supposing that a border incident in Eritrea during the WWI leads to an Italian declaration of war on Abyssinia, your country will be forced to align itself with the Central Powers, and resist the Italian and British invasions.

These fictional scenarios will take place in the same timeline that the "Weltkrieg" campaign, so if you're successful you'll eventually repel the invaders, conquer Eritrea and Somalia, and make Abyssinia become a staunch ally of Germany and the Ottoman Empire.

Well, the time has come. Make your choice!
