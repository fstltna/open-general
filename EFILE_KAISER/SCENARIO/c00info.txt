VORONEZH (22 OCTOBER 1919)

Comrade Commander! Come quickly, we must act swiftly.  Let me introduce you. I am the political commissar attached to your command.  The capitalist swine's are close to crushing our glorious revolution!  The Great War is over but the war for communism is still in its early phase.  We have overthrown the Tsar but that has not stopped the capitalists, monarchists and other enemies of the people to unite, raise forces and march on our people's republic!  Petrograd lies under attack and Siberia is under enemy control.   Now from the Ukraine a certain traitor named Denikin is directing his army towards our capital of Moscow!

But we are not defeated yet!  While the White armies of Denikin march north, their front becomes wider and wider.  Our Eight Army has just now lost the city of Voronezh at the Don River.  However the army is still intact and resumes fighting.  Reinforcements from Moscow are on their way as we speak!  Your newly formed command of the First Cavalry Army has been ordered to move out and attack Voronezh from the west.  Indeed comrade, you will be cutting through their flank like a knife through butter! 

Do not stop for nothing.  Go for your objectives.  Make terror your weapon!  Liberate the peasants of Voronezh!
