Road to Baghdad, Iraq
CO General Vittorio Ambrosio

General, after the Near East has fallen in our hand it is time to conquer the Iraq! The strategic position against the Caucasus and his Oil make this region to a worthwhile target. The British have build up some Divisions with Polish Volunteers in the last time. Show the Polish troops your art of warfare, so they will never forget this lesson.
