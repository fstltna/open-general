  "Tell the Girls to send a Picture" 11/09/39
 Abbeville was under the Gun.The SS/BdM poised to remove the defenders there. Overhead roamed the Air Korps and any Civilians trying to get to Paris were strafted.The roads were clogged so French replacements wasted time trying to get to where they needed to be.And 'Le Grande Armee also was leary of using the roads.The Civilians had had faith but that was erroding second by second.French soldiers were slandered,spit at and even attacked by the thousands dis-placed by the War.Where was there to go to?Sure head for Paris figuring that was more protected than other areas but already the City was over-burdened with People,short on Food and was becoming a place of the Starving and Dead.The French Goverment was not able to cope with the War from a Military or Civilian angle.So slowly there rose a Resistance.At First it was anti-Nazi,then Against the People crowding the area taking Food and stealing but now it decided the Goverment was of little value so attack local officials.France was falling apart.So the SS after Abbeville would send a few Panzers to the Coast,the Girls could take a dip in the water.ILse wanted a Picture of that Glorious Event.She would make a copy and send it to dear Winston and entitled it 'We will dip in the Thames too'.
