The Palataine Uprising * V

Not bad, Herr General !

...but again, we have no chance to hold the conquered positions:  two complete prussian Armycorps are arriving from the north and the west...
But there's very good news, too ! The People of Baden and their whole army, except the High Command, has joined again our side!
Now, we must retreat to Baden, and unite our armies....
