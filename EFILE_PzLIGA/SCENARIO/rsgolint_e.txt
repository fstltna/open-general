Nomonhan Incident

August, 1939

Welcome to Manchukuo commander. The Kwantung army high command has requested to Tokyo your presence here, since you are the best officer to face the Soviets due to your past experience at Korea.

We are involved at the Mongol-Manchu border into a fierce fight agaisnt Soviet and Mongol troops since March, as the Soviets continues refusing to recognise the true boundaries of Jap... err of our Manchukuoan allies. The Soviets have massed an enormous force at the West bank of the Khalkhin Gol river to retake the vicitinies of the Nomonhan village. What the Kwantung army wants from you, is to deploy your command there, and face the Soviets. Your skills, probably will be the solution for this new... incident.
