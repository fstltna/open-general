Kemmelberg- April, 1918 - V

I’m so sorry, Herr Oberst. You and your men have behaved like legendary heroes. You have risked everything, you have faced a terrible foe, and you have succeeded. And still,  it’s all been for nothing.

Our enemies are simply too powerful. There are too many of them. It was foolish to believe that we could fight against five military powers at the same time. It was madness. We did everything we could, we did our best, and we really were so close... we touched victory with our fingertips. But, at the last second, victory ran away from us.

We have nothing to reinforce your men. We don’t have more guns, or planes, or rifles. There aren’t any fresh troops ready to relieve you. We have thrown everything we had against the Entente lines, and they resisted. Now we have nothing left to exploit your success in Kemmel.

It’s time to prepare for the worse. The offensive must be cancelled. Still, we must fight to the end and prevent an invasion of Germany.
