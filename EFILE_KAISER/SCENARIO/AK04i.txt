Somewhere in the south-eastern Carpathians - December 22nd, 1916

Liebe Anna,

Yesterday, I spent the evening singing Christmas carols with some of my dearest comrades in an old, abandoned farmhouse in the snowy Carpathian mountains. In the warm, glimmering light of the fireside, I saw many eyes filled with tears, while our sore throats intonated "Stille Nacht, heilige Nacht". My heart felt heavy, too, when I thought of you and our loved ones and the many times we have sung this song together on Christmas Eve. How I wished I was with you, back in Germany, my love!

But instead of celebrating, Christmas will be a time for fighting this year for us here in Romania. Just a few minutes ago, I was informed that the new offensive is about to begin. Since our victory at the Roterturmpass we have chased the enemy across the mountains and valleys. Now we have reached the south-eastern slopes of the Carpathians, and the resistance has stiffened again. The Romanians have received reinforcements by their Russian ally. A few days ago, while on patrol, I watched some mounted cossacks in the distance. But I am pretty sure, we will deal with them as well.

Frohe Weihnachten! 

Ich liebe Dich,
Dein Hugo


ORDERS: Oberstleutnant Bauernschmitt, we will launch a new offensive further south against the city of Ramnicu Sarat, in order to finally break out of the moutain range and reach the plains. The Alpenkorps and the Austro-Hungarian 73rd Division are given the task to support this assault by attacking the last remaining enemy positions in the Carpathians. Be aware, that Russian reinforcements have arrived in the area and will probably try to counter-attack. As reinforcements for your troops, the Württemberg mountain battalion will be temporarily under your command during this battle. 

    
OBJECTIVES: Take all VHs.
