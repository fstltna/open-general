Medean Pass, 9th March 1916
------------------------------------------------
We have pursued the remnants of the enemy all across the desert til the gates of Sollum. It is unlikely that the Senussi will put much effort in defending the city itself, but probably they will try to stop us at the Medean Pass and deny us entering their Libyan homeland. So be prepared to encounter stout resistance in the hills south of Sollum.

Our task is not only to retake Sollum and secure the Medean Pass, but also to relieve our Italian allies, who are sieged by the Senussi at Bardia, and finally, to destroy the Senussi war camp at Bir Asiso. For this operation, a company of the Imperial Camel Corps and the Duke of Westminster's armoured car detachment will temporarily be under your command.
