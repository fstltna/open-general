MERSA MATHRUH - EXIT Gen.RICHIE June26 1942

The British troops have fallen back on Mersa Matruh where they are joined by fresh Indian troops and the 2nd NZ Div. You are now in command of Ariete, Trieste, the inexperienced Littorio armoured division and the few mobile troops of X and XXI Corps that have crossed the Lybia-Egypt border. Ariete and Trieste and 15 Pz are positioned on the right flank to keep the 1 Arm Div busy while the rest of DAK assisted by Littorio and the Infantry Divisions cut off the 8th Army forces.
