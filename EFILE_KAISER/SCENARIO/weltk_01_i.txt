Schlacht in Lothringen

Aug 20th, 1914

The main French attack is taking place in Lothringen, where in fact they've managed to penetrate deep into our lines. If we don't stop them even Metz and Strassburg could be in danger. Gather your troops, counterattack and drive the French out of Germany!
