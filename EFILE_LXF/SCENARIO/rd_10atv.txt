Comrade General, you have done us a terrible disservice.  Our spies had informed us we would be greeted as liberators when we entered London.  Instead, your bungling command caused huge amounts of carnage to the city itself, and the surrounding countryside. In addition, some Allied units were able to withdraw to the north, in Scotland, and now there is the possibility of the United States entering the war, after witnessing our weakness in London.  You are to report to the train station, Comrade General.  Your services are no longer needed here.
