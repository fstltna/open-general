HQ 6th Army, Sicily
General Alfredo Guzzoni

Welcome to Sicily, General! The Allies landed on the island. British troops have advanced on Catania, Paratroopers and Commandos have landed and are trying to take bridges and vital road junctions. Start a counterattack! If you can't stop the Allies here, Sicily is lost for us. We have no reserves.
