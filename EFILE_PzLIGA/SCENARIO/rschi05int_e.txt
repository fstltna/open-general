Advance on South China

Wellcome and congratulations as the new commander of this sector.  Please, let me explain the current situation.  We are pressing the chinese from the North and have a solid base at Canton.  Since our devastating attack on Pearl Harbour the United Kingdom has declared war on us.  The presence of their two european outposts - the portuguese Macao and british Hong Kong are a problem. Up to now, our main objective here is to crush the chinese resistance, just attack the european positions if you are able to do it, otherwise, focus your efforts on the chinese troops only.

We need to solve it quickly, otherwise the enemy will have a possible beach head  in our backyard.

General, your troops must quickly defeat our enemies!

[Victory Conditions]: The High Command, will considere that to achieve a Brilliant Victory, you must take all the objectives, this will mean attack and capture Hong Kong and Macao. For a single Victory, take 10 objectives, this would include some of the portuguese or british objectives. If you decides to attack only the chinese, it will be a Tactical Victory.
