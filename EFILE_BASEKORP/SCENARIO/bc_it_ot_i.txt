OPERATION TOTALISE
August 8th, 1944

With Caen now taken you been have tasked with establishing a breakout south of the city, paving the way for a linkup with American forces attacking from the west.  The immediate goal is to secure the high ground north of Falaise.  It is hoped that with this offensive we can provoke a general collapse of the German front.
