You did the job, General. Those foolish British believed that our great Army was not able to fight this splendid way! You and your men proved that they are wrong: we have surrounded Damascus with a Free French division in it and drove the British troops back. Those Arab people are fighting too in the British Legions! That won't help them from stopping us, though! Thanks to you.
