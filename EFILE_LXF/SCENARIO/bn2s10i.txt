
RAID ON TOBRUK - 27 May 1942

Cyrenaica, Libya
CO General Erwin Rommel

General, for this job we need a man of your quality. In order to take the fortress Tobruk, we must break through the enemy positions at the Ghasala line. Our Tank divisions bypass the English positions at night.  They are ready for an attack at the southern flank of the enemy. While a diversionary attack on Ghasala is executed, advance with our tanks to the north on Acroma. That will force the enemy to withdraw. Good luck, General!
