Tel-el-Kebir

September 13th, 1882

In 1878 a group of Egyptian officers led by Colonel Urabi had rebelled against the Khedive, and a couple of years later they virtually controlled that country. Our government feared that Urabi's policies could damage the investments of British companies in Egypt and our interests in the Suez Canal, so it gave support to the Khedive and in 1882, after our fleet bombarded Alexandria, a British expeditionary force disembarked in Egypt.

As a member of the 2nd battalion of the Grenadier Guards, I was one of the officers of that army. Aside from patriotism and sense of duty, at that moment in my life I had strong personal reasons for searching the glory of battle; I had finally found the courage to propose to my dear Evelyn, but I still feared that Colonel Worthington wouldn't approve the marriage of his only daughter to a mere Lieutenant with little combat experience.

These were the thoughts that occupied my mind when General Wolseley decided that, after securing the Suez Canal, we would finally march on Cairo. We knew that the main Egyptian force was heavily entrenched at Tel-el-Kebir, near the railway that linked Cairo to Ismailia. Apparently, the enemy didn't send any reconnaissance patrols out of their trenches at night, so Wolseley thought that we could approach their position by night, surprise them and stage a frontal assault at dawn.
Providence favoured us, and everything went according to Wolseley's plan. With the first rays of light of September 13th we were ready to attack.
