THE STORY

To clear the territory of the "Uzice Republic", the German Army employed its 113th Infantry Division and 342nd Infantry Division, and parts of 704, 714, 717 and 718 Infantry Divisions. They were assisted by Dimitrije Ljotic’s Serbian Volunteer Corps and Kosta Pecanac’s personal Chetnik faction. As German forces entered the territory they faced significant resistance, especially on Rudnik Mountain and in Kraljevo. On September 29, the offensive officially started when the 342nd Infantry Division attacked Partisans on the road between Sabac and Loznica.

German forces and their allies advanced from the north and east towards Uzice, and by the 2nd half of November the Partisan forces were in full retreat. On November 25, the final phase of the German offensive against both rebel groups began. Tito and Mihailovic had one last phone conversation : Tito announced that he would defend his positions, while Mihailovic said that he would disperse. Ultimately, on November 29, the Partisans, including their headquarters which were stationed there, left Uzice.

After leaving Uzice, the Partisans headed for Sandzak, into Italian-occupied territory. Some detachments failed to retreat on time and were dispersed or destroyed. After the main Partisan forces left for Sandzak, only parts of 5 Partisan detachments were present in Serbia.
