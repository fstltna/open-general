Choice. Now what, player?

Well done. In the first phase of the Tobol offensive, you've achieved a brilliant victory. That gives you the chance to keep on advancing until you destroy the Red Army. You could change history, forcing Lenin and the Bolsheviks to sign a peace treaty with Kolchak, and to accept the partition of Russia.

If that's what you want.

Maybe you don't like to play fictional scenarios. Perhaps you've already played the "treaty" path of this campaign and now you'd like to test new battles. There are many possible reasons.

Well, it's up to you to decide how the campaign will go on. If you click on the western flag, you'll play one fictional scenario that will end with a negotiated peace.

If you click on the eastern flag, then you'll play three historical scenarios in Siberia. You'll cross the Chinese border and end your days in exile, or you'll suffer a terrible death during the winter. 

Choose what you prefer.
