Verdun - May 31st, 1916

Liebe Anna,

Things have considerably worsened in these past months. Changing Serbia for Rheims was bad enough, but you and me knew that, sooner or later, an even darker day would come. That day is today. Here I am, at the front of Verdun, ready to enter combat in what is, possibly, the most terrible place on Earth. Many brave German soldiers have sacrificed themselves here since this year began. Now it's the turn of the Alpenkorps. We must keep on pressing the Fench once and again. Eventually, they won't be able to resist anymore and France will surrender. At least, that's the plan. Our country demands it, and we'll obey. That's what soldiers do.

Now we'll assault the French positions and, after we suceed and the battle is over, I'll write you again. That way you'll know that I'm still alive. I can't give you more details, for security reasons. Believe me, it's better that way. 
 
Erinnere dich an mich,
Hugo

ORDERS:  Oberstleutnant Hugo Bauernschmitt, you must assault the French positions at Fort Vaux, take them and hold them. The French are heavily entrenched, so your pionieres will be of great use to you. The 1st, the 50th and the 7th Reserve infantry divisions will be part of the attack, too.

OBJECTIVES: Take all the VHs.
