Mons - The Old Contemptibles - August 22th 1914

After pushing the Belgian Army back to Antwerp, the German First Armee turns south. Only the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), a 'contemptible little army' comprising 75,000 men stands between them and Paris. 

The BEF's II Corps has taken position behind the Mons-Conde Canal in a terrain filled with ditches, half destroyed buildings, poor roads and high slag heaps that make it difficult to maneuver.

The German commander Von Kluck does not get permission to encircle the BEF from the West because he would run the risk of losing contact with the Second Armee to his left, so he has to attack the BEF head-on.

Your 4th Kavallerie Division's troops must once again cover the flank.
