   "The French think it's Impregnable" 
  The Maginot Line.A line of Fortifications no one would ever dare to challenge,Shades of the First World Wars Entrenched Philosophy gone awry.The French people had suffered through the Years being taxed to Death after the 'War to End all Wars' so a wall could be put up and stop anymore Wars coming from the East and especially from the near East,Germany. SS units had done bypassed it and just wanted to let it sit there with all the troops inside doing nothing but twindling their thumbs while the SS took Paris, the Coast and the rest of France.Fuhress Ilse though wanted it to be destroyed stating "show the French how they have wasted their time building stupid fortifications, wasted their manpower and wasted their money, defense does not Win Wars.Show the French that the 'Great War' that was 20 years ago is nothing compared to this War we are bringing to them and the rest of this Man build decatant planet".So the SS would attack the 'Line with the main objective being the Airfields of 1st Armee de L' Air.Of course the Common Frau was impressed with the Concrete and Fortress Guns of the French but knew soon the French would be impressed with Soldierett's in Skirts and 'BdM' armbands attacking them.
