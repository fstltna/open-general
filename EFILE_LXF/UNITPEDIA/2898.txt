A submarine base is a military base that shelters submarines and their personnel.

Examples of present-day submarine bases include HMNB Clyde, Île Longue (the base for France's Force océanique stratégique), Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay, Naval Submarine Base New London, and Rybachiy Nuclear Submarine Base (near Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky).

The Israeli navy bases its growing submarine force in Haifa.

Former submarine bases include DORA 1, HMAS Platypus, Naval Submarine Base Bangor (now part of Naval Base Kitsap), Mare Island Naval Shipyard (a nuclear-capable base), Ordnance Island in Bermuda during World War II, and the formerly-classified Soviet base at Balaklava in the now Autonomous Republic of Crimea.

The hamlet of New Suffolk, New York claims to be the first submarine base in the United States: it served as the base for USS Holland, a submarine launched in May 1897 and several Plunger class submarines launched 1901-1903.
