BATTLE OF GORRAHEI

November 2nd, 1935 (Ogaden Region, Hararge Province, Southern Ethiopia)

In the early hours of 3 October a hundred thousand Italian troops crossed the Eritrean frontier. Yet the first stage of this particular invasion was surprisingly peaceful, almost idyllic.

On the northern front, four days later, Adowa, Enticcio and Adigrat had been occupied without a battle and almost without incident. The Negus had issued strict orders to the lords not to resist the Italian advance: his purpose was to show the world who was the aggressor. It was more amazing that his orders had been so nearly followed.

Haile Selassie Gugsa announced that he had declared for Italy and that the road to Makalle lay open. Yet, as it happened, this was the first and last open defection to the Italians of an important noble and his men. The Italians, deceived by the known rivalries, had underestimated the inner cohesion of Ethiopia's ruling class when threatened by outsiders.

On the southern front, there had been no solid advance but a series of skirmishes. More seriously, the Italians prepared to move against Gorrahei where Afework's forces had now been joined by the first Guards battalion from Harar.

Colonel Frusci prepared an operation on a large scale with his MECHANIZED and EXPERIENCED Arabo-Somali battalions. On 2 November ITALIAN PLANES BOMBED the Mullah's stone fort.
