
ENTERING TEHAMA - 2/1/1313 (22 MAR 1934)

South of Abha, Asir Province

Allahu Akbar! Our diplomatic efforts have failed. The peace delegation sent by Ibn Saud was jailed by King Yahya including a son of our King and the offensive words of  Yahya, "Who is this Bedouin coming to challenge my family's 900 year rule?", completely exhausted the patience of Ibn Saud. Our King ordered the Crown Prince of Arabia to re-occupy townships in the highlands of Tehama which the Iman of the Yemen has seized.
Parts of the regular army will attack Abha in the north and try to break through the highlands to the coast, while your troops perform the attack in the south!

GOAL: Take all VH's!

Main reinforcements:
5th turn - northeast, Cavalry detachment (3 units)


STORY: Saudi Arabian and Yemeni representatives held negotiations between February and March 22, 1934. But the delegation sent by ibn Saud was jailed by King Yahya including a son of the Saudi king. This was the day when King Yahya said his famous saying: "Who is this bedouin coming to challenge my family's 900 year rule?" The king of Yemen then sent the Idrissi back to his lands with an army and some 30,000 Saudi Arabian troops and 37,000 Yemeni troops resumed military hostilities on March 22, 1934.
