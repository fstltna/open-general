BRILLIANT VICTORY

You rushed west and took Odessa without too much trouble, an admirable achievement. After months of advancing, our troops in the Ukraine will stop large offensive actions as almost the entire Ukraine has been liberated now. But our great nation is larger than just the Ukraine and those areas are waiting for our troops to liberate them from the fascist oppression. Your forces will be send to the Crimea. Other forces will start attacks in Byelorussia and the Baltics.
