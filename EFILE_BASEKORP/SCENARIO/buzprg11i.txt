Ostrava, the Heart of Steel

Part 6/7 of the "Commanding the Corps" minicampaign.

*****

The Ostrava offensive operation began in the early days of March, but it proceeded very slowly. Germans entrenched themselves heavily, sometimes using the old pre-war Czechoslovak fortificatons, although those were long ago outdated and stripped of the heavy guns.

Attacking armies had great losses and were unable to breach German firm defense. On 22nd April 1945 Opava was captured and this helped to develop the forces. Final assault of Ostrava started just a few days later.

Intelligence and reconnaisance: Ostrava is the last greater German industry centrum. Her coal mines and ironworks are very important, the city itself is a gate to Moravia and then further to Bohemia. Hitler's soldiers are ordered to never surrrender, never withdraw and they will fight till death.
Their forces consist of a robust defensive ring on a Velka Polom - Hlucin - Ostrava and several garrisons in the inland cities. They moved in everything they got, every reserve they have.

Reinforces: None.

Hint: Once you capture Ostrava, you may use the city as a base for further operations...

Victory conditions: Capture all VHs.
