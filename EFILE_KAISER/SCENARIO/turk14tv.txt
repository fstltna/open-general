Second Battle of Gaza  - tactical victory

Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) infantry brigades succeeded in entering our trenches at multiple points. You were unable to repulse them, so we had to retreat to the next line of defense.

Historical outcome 
Ottoman forces were able to repulse the weakened EEF troops from the trenches that the EEF infantry brigades took in the initial assaults. British losses were about 6,000 men. Ottoman losses only a third of that. Moral in the Ottoman Fourth Army was high. The EEF dug in and stayed in the trenches opposite Ottoman forces for six months.
