Montejurra

November 7th, 1873

The republican army is determined to destroy us and take Estella, our capital. The troops of General Moriones, more than 15,000 men, have assaulted our advanced positions and now they already control the villages at the foothills of Montejurra.
This mountain is essential to the defense of Estella, so it is imperative to reject the enemy attack. Gather your battalions and defend Montejurra at all costs.

Victory conditions: Take all the VHs.

Notes: Use the terrain to your advantage. The enemy has superior numbers, but they won't be able to take advantage of it if they have to fight in a narrow zone.

The unit that takes Luquín will earn +100 pex.
