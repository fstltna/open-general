OPERATION IRONCLAD
May 5th, 1942

Commander, we have stormed ashore on the northern side of the Vichy French held island of Madgascar in order to prevent the Japanese from using the islands ports.  With a submarine base in Madagascar the Japanese navy would be able to threaten our supply route to the 8th Army, our merchant shipping and the Eastern Fleet.

Your first objective is the port of Diego Suarez.  The Vichy defenders are expected to be a mix of French colonial troops along with local volunteers.  You will have naval support provided by several battleships, cruisers and destroyers, and you will also receive air support from aircraft flying out from our aircraft carriers.

[NOTE:  There is limited deployment in this scenario.]
