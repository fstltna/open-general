Advance on Asturias

Orders from: Pamplona (Navarra), August 1936

Me alegra verle de nuevo, Sr. General.  Well, after securing a victory at Guipuzcoa, we must turn our attention to Asturias.  Since July our brave comrades have been suffering under siege from the Reds.  In Gijon, our quarters have been surrounded and our men trapped.  They are rapidly running out of supplies and can barely continue resisting.   So in the future we can only anticipate more bad news from Gijon.  In Oviedo Colonel Aranda has secured the city.   However, the Asturian capital is also under siege and about to fall.

Your main task is to advance your troops to the center of Asturian and to give further assistance to Gijon and Oviedo.  You may recruit troops for a column under your command.

Nuestros camaradas esperan su ayuda, dese prisa.
