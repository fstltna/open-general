Gospodin General-Leitenant, you have broken the Austrian offensive through Dukla Pass and solidified our hold on this valuable strategic position.  The overall situation for our entire front in January, however, began assuming an aspect of precariousness.  The SW Front command (Ivanov) continued to build up reserves at the expense of the NW Front -- which was selected by Stavka as the instrument for the major 1915 offensive effort against German forces in North Poland.  The fact that our losses -- and, particularly, the ammunition problem -- could hardly support one offensive did not discourage Ivanov from pushing for a parallel offensive effort.

While our 11th Army is tied up during its siege of Przemysl, only the 8th stands between the bulk of Austrian armies and the besieged garrison.  Without a doubt, the Austrians will attempt further offensives in this direction.
