The enemy thinks he has occupied the so-called ''Iron Triangle'', but many of our southern comrades are now hidden in this areas secret underground tunnels.  They are preparing their former positions for the return of our troops there. 

Hanoi wants to celebrate your victory by moving your troops to a quiet place to give you and your men a rest.
