You have made an outstanding job stopping this fierce enemy attack. Unfortunately, at Kajmakchalan, east of your positions, the Serbians managed to break our lines, although with heavy losses. In order to avoid the risk of being encircled, you will have to retreat to the Crna Bend, north of Lerin, for regrouping.
