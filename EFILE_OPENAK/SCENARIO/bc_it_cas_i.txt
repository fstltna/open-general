OPERATION PANTHER
January 17th, 1944

Progress has been disappointing.  Poor weather and terrain, coupled with a skillful German defence has made our further advance slow and painful all across the front.  In front of us now is the Gustav Line, otherwise known as the Winter Line, the last defensive position the Germans are holding south of Rome.  Our unit, as part of the X Corps, will be the first to launch a co-ordinated attack on this line, while the U.S. VI Corps lands at Anzio, further up the coast.

Please note, while your group crosses the Garigliano River in the south near Minturno, the 46th Infantry Division will begin their crossing in the north in a few days.
