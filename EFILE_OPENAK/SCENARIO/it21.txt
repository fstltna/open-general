ALAM HALFA August31 1942

This is it - your final chance to break through 8th Army's lines before they get major reinforcements. We have completely lost air superiority and intelligence reports 100,000 tons of US material and supplies on route for Egypt. Enemy mine fields keep on being extended and their defences deepened - especially in the North.

Trento, Bologna and 164Le will hold the line in the North while DAK and your Ariete, Trieste and Littorio divisions will break through in the South and swing northwards round the rear of 8th Army's positions. The key to the battle will be the Alam Halfa Ridge.

Notes: 
- Please pay attention. Next to the supply hex, there is also a single deployment hex in the extreme South.
- Only V and BV lead to a further advance in Egypt. Take a TV or L for the historic path.

News:
- The remainder of 164Le has arrived although they still miss their heavy equiment.
- Ramcke's German paratrooper brigade and our Folgore paratrooper division have reached the front. 
- On August 7th, Churchill accepted the proposal to elevate General Gott, of 13 Corps, to the command of the army. Next day however we intercepted and shot down his Bombay transport.  Gott was amongst those killed.
- Churchill then appointed General Sir Harold Alexander for the Middle East command and Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomery for Eighth Army.
