September 22, 1940

The Second Vienna Award reassigned the territory of Northern Transylvania (43.000 km2) from Romania to Hungary on August 30, 1940. Our troops completed the reannexation process on September 13. Only a few Iron Guard (Garda de fier) squads provoked smaller skirmishes. Governor Horthy decided to treat them as casus belli and ordered you to invade Southern Transylvania. Your task is retake Nagyszeben (Sibiu) with its vital road and railway junctions. Do not fail us, General!

HQ has approved the expansion of your forces to include an Artillery detachment.

NOTE: You have 15 DHs. Take all VHs!
