As World War I broke out, ethnic Czechs and Slovaks living in the Russian Empire petitioned Emperor Nicholas II of Russia to let them set up a national force to fight against Austria-Hungary. The Tsar finally gave his assent. The force was composed of many prisoners and deserters from the army of the Austro-Hungarian Empire which were from the territories of Bohemia, Moravia and Slovakia. It rose in size and its first independant action was during the Russian Kerensky Offensive in between of the two Russian revolutions in the summer of 1917.

After the Russian Revolution of 1917 the Bolshevik government concluded the separate Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and it was agreed between the Bolsheviks and the corps to evacuate the Czechs and Slovaks to France to join the Czechoslovak corps and continue fighting there. Because the European front was blocked by German and Austrian armies, the evacuation was to be done by a detour via Siberia, the Pacific port of Vladivostok and the USA.

Along the railroad many troubles took place. Skirmishes with retreating Hungarian POWs lead to a rise against the Bolsheviks. Subsequently the Czech Legion took possession of huge parts of Siberia and even reaching the Volga River in the west.

In the summer of 1918 Austria-Hungary was defeated and the new state of Czechoslovakia was a fact. The Legion had a home to go to. It withdrew from the conflicts of the Russian Civil War as best as it could from then on. Eventually the Legion was evacuated via Vladivostok - three years after their first battle action.
