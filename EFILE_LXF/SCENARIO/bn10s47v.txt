You have achieved all objectives, the mission was a complete success. Good work!

This crushing defeat was too much for the American people, the pressure to demand a cease-fire too large. At least negotiations are in progress and the conditions, I think, will be fair. Until the signing of a peace treaty parts of the American east coast remain occupied, Army, Air Force and Fleet will be reduced to a minimum. The Pacific and Caribbean possessions will be resolved and the Panama Canal comes under international control. Also Canada, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand end her fight and be involved in the negotiations.

Last order to you: Go back home and let you celebrate as hero. Bon Voyage!

CAMPAIGN WON!!!

Congratulations, you have successfully completed the campaign!
