You could not achieve your goals, the mission was a failure! Hopefully you have gained some experience to avoid such failures in future. You are transferred again to USS Saratoga.


BACKGROUND

Task Force 14 (Rear Admiral A. E. Montgomery), composed of six new carriers, seven cruisers, and 24 destroyers, making it the largest carrier task force yet assembled, bombed and bombarded Japanese installations on Wake. In the course of the 2-day strikes, ship handling techniques for a multicarrier force, devised by Rear Admiral F. C. Sherman's staff on the basis of experience in the South Pacific, were tested under combat conditions. Lessons learned from operating the carriers as a single group of six, as two groups of three, and as three groups of two, provided the basis for many tactics which later characterized carrier task force operations.
