General,

The "Ligne KW" (Dyle line) has resisted as we thought. The Germans have suffered heavy losses and have not been able to break through our lines. 

You have done an excellent job. Congratulations!!!.

Unfortunately, we have received orders to retire. It seems that the German Army has broken the French defences at Sedan and it is now free to drive for the English Channel. To avoid our southern flanks from being turned by the German forces we have to retire once more. Our new defensive line will be the Escaut/Scheldt river.

I know this means abandoning Brussels and Leuven but I am confident we will check the German advance there.

Le Chef d'Etat-major général de l’armée (EMGA).

Historical note:

The troops at the "Ligne KW" (Dyle position) river were not particularly hard pressed and two attempts to cross the Dijle/Dyle River around Leuven/Louvain were fairly easily beaten off.

However, as a complete surprise, on 16th May the BEF started to leave their positions at the Dijle/Dyle river. Soon orders came for the Belgian army to retreat. The Germans had broken trough at Sedan and were racing towards the coast threatening to cut of the Armies in Belgium from the main body of the French army.
