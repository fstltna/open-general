Come in General! A toast of mulled wine!

Your troops fought well.

We have made contact with 6th Army, but, Hitler refused to allow a withdrawl!  4th Panzer Army and our forces are to hold this fragile corridor open for the entire winter if need be!

Manstein has reportedly flown to Berlin to confer directly with Hilter on the reality of the situation, Madness!

Pray for us General, pray for us all that Manstein is successful!
