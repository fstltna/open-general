You have lost this battle! 

The Germans have been forced to retreat with heavy losses that they will not be able to replace. With his army decimated Von Lettow had no other option but to surrender.  Your campaign is over.

Historical aftermath: The British resistance was very hard and although they finally surrendered, they inflicted heavy casualties on the Germans. Aware that he could not replace his losses, Lettow-Vorbeck decided to avoid any more large scale battles and start a guerrilla warfare.  This would come against the Uganda Railway.
