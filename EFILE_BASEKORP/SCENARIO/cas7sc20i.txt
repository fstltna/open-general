As you well know - you of all people certainly! - the Soviets are running for their lives. However, since most people in the old leadership are either dead or captured, it is uncertain who is in charge of the Soviet forces. We must therefore chase them and capture as many Soviet soldiers as possible. Capture Gorki and we will have secured the Moscow-Gorki area, the largest industrial area in Russia.
