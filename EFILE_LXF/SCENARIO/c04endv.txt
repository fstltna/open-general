VICTORY

Our flag now overlooks the silver Moldau River! Though there are other elements still fighting skirmishes with several small pockets of Czech soldiers in some areas of Prague, the city is largely ours. This has been devastating to the Czech morale and the tonight the news will be spread around the world that Prague is in German hands. The world will look up to the Wehrmacht once again!
