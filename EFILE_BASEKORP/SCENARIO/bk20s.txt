Good evening Herr General. As you are aware, our Fuhrer likes to attack neutral coutries that do not support us. The Yugoslavians have been leaning towards the Allies & need to be taught a lesson. A swift invasion from the Adriatic Sea will be that lesson. They will not be expecting a sea invasion. Our Bulgarian allies will be supporting you Herr General.
