Translated the name means "German Marine assault troops".
Formed in 1938 as a small and secret Kriegsmarine formation, they saw some action in the Spanish civil war, were among the first during the invasion of Poland, and then spent the rest of the war in the eastern front.
In reality they were not overly efficient, here in OG they are an expensive elite troop.
Due to their rarity (they were 230 men all in all...) you can't buy them.
