La Bataille du Matz

June 9, 1918

In spring 1918 Ludendorff launched a series of great offensives supported by a massive artillery bombardment, in an attempt to get the final breakthrough.The Matz battle should end the Aisne offensive (the 3rd German drive) victoriously, by taking Compiegne and then opening the road on Paris. In the beginning, the entrenched French 3rd Army is totally overwhelmed by the numerical superiority and the surprise effect, but soon a counterattack force is formed under General Mangin's command to regain the lost territory.

On the afternoon of the 11 June General Mangin launched his counterattack.  5 divisions are under the order of Mangin Corps: 129DI (+ 2 groups of St Chamond tanks), 152DI (+ 4 groups of Schneider tanks), 165DI (+ 3 groups of Schneider), 48DI (+ 3 groups of Saint Chamond). The 133DI stays in reserve with one brigade of British armored cars. 2 regiments of corps artillery support the attack: 46RAC & 246RAC.

The counterattack stops the German advance but the gains for the 11 June are only 3-4 kilometers.  On 12th June the counterattack is relaunched but the advance is only of 2 kms.  On June 13th the battle is over. A lot of ground has been lost on French side but the German offensive on Compiegne has been stopped.
