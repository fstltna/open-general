Battle of Romania
After we made peace with Finland, we want to urge Romania out of the war, because with the loss of the Romanian oilfield the Germans will not be able to perform big resistance. You have to break through the Axis lines at Jassy.
Your troops:
You only have the command about your tank army.
Enemy troops:
The Germans and Romanians have several divisions in this area. More precisely you are fighting against the Heeresgruppe Südukraine which consists of the Army Group Wohler, the Army Group Dumitrescu and the 4th Romanian Army. The Germans have some heavy tanks and will be able to perform a hard counterattack if you are not able to perform a good first strike. The Romanians have suffered heavy losses in the war and their troops are quite under normal strength.
Sgn. Major Heinz
