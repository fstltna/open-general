The Japanese fighter bases around Lae have long been a thorn in our side. 
Most of the top Japanese air aces have come from the Lae air groups. Unable 
to defeat them in the air, we finally have a chance to take them from the 
ground. A concerted effort by your forces should overrun the 
airfields. Japanese resistance is expected to be the toughest we have 
encountered yet.
