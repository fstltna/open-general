Situation:
We have crossed the Eifel and in front of us is the Rhine at Remagen. Parts of the 7th Army are defendsing this area. In the north a paratrooper division is blocking the road to Remagen, in the south the last remaining armoured units are defending the airfield south of Sinzig. It seems that the Ludendorff Bridge is not yet blown. If you are fast enough, it could be possible to capture the bridge before it will be destroyed.

Orders: 
Take the Ludendorff Bridge!

A hint: 
Do not underestiminate the germans! Although they have not many armoured vehicles, they are well known of the terrain and especially in the north you will need units with a good defense and good attack against entrechened infantry.
