1914 El Raisuli's uprising (II): Battle of Kesiva

(Part of the Djebala campaign)

May, 12th, 1914

Message from General Fernández Silvestre's HQ:

General, some enemy harkas led by El Raisuli have been seen near the village of Kesiva near the coastal town of Arcila. Apparently he has ventured near our lines in order to get supplies for his men. We must stop him immediately so he can't take control of the road which goes from Larache to Tangier. Prepare your troops and drive El Raisuli back to his mountains!


Victory conditions: Take all VHs.
