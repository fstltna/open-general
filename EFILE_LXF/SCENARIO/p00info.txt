00. BADAJOZ (12 August 1936)

Colonel! In Spain, the military have taken up arms against the Socialist government in Madrid. A complete Civil War is about to start as the entire Spanish Army is splitting into a loyal, Republican side, and a rebel, Nationalist side. Our hopes and thoughts are naturally with the Nationalists who try to restore the Catholic Church and holds the fascist ideas high.

The main areas of the Nationalist revolt are in northern Spain and in Morocco. The Moroccan Army has been airlifted to southern Spain by German aircraft. They are now marching north to join with their other troops in the north. A vital town and communication center along this way is the old city of Badajoz which is only a few miles off the Portuguese border with Spain. Our leader, Salazar, has already secretly offered the use of airfields on our soil. But now you will secretly advance into Spain and assist the Maroccan Army in capturing Badajoz. All remains highly secret because if this gets out, Portugal might be in trouble. We wish to remain neutral. Good luck, Colonel!
