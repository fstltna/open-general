BEDA-FOMM February1941 L

Another disaster. Another Corps lost.

The Germans responded to our requests for help and have sent over General Erwin Rommel with what should soon be 2 divisions. The German Fliegerkorps X was moved from Norway to Sicily December last year to patrol the sea lines between Italy and Libya.

But I am afraid that even this might not save Tripoli.
