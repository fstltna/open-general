08. Normandy - Operation Spring - Germans and Canadians in the heart of Hell  LOSS

Herr Major, disaster! Not only have we been beaten back here South-West of Caen, the Americans have broken through our lines near Saint-Lô. 

HISTORY
German forces held the ridge and beat back the Canadians with heavy losses. At the same time US forces launched operation Cobra which would lead to the breakout of Normandy only days later. The severely depleted 503sPzAbt managed to escape the horrors of the Falaise Pocket and was engaged in a fighting withdrawal to the German border. In late August 1944 the detachment was pulled from the line for a complete refit with Tiger IIs and was sent to Hungary in September.
