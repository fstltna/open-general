Liberating Bialorus

August 4th, 1919

Good Morning General!
 As you know, after taking Wilno, Polish authorities issued a Proclamation to the inhabitants of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Poles hoped that liberating Wilno from the hands of the Russians would give them a chance to recreate the historical state.

The next step is to liberate Bialorus and create there another independent state that would serve as an ally separating Poland from Russia.

Our next target will be the city of Minsk Litewski which is the capital of Bialorus. You will lead forces striking south and cutting off the Red Army units. These units should be destroyed by our forces from Wielkopolska and our Bialorussian allies from 1st Dywizja Litewsko-Bialoruska.

Victory conditions: Liberate Minsk, cut off the roads of retreat, and take all VHs.

Intelligence report: The roads here have been devastated by the battles of the Great War and Soviet occupation. You can expect fortifications here so prepare your forces for difficult warfare. Don't expect further reinforcements. White Armies started to attack in the south so the Red Army should not be reinforced in our area. 

Good Luck!

Note: You can buy Central Lithuanian units in this scenario.
