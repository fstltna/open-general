Herr General,

The Russians position can be characterised as a big wedge with Pommerania to the north of it, and Silesia south of it. You are to start a slow attack on the head of it. In the mean time we will transfer large formations of new panzers to Silesia and Pommerania. These wil then march on the besieged city of Posen, and trap the Whiterussian front.
