Raid on Misir, February 3rd, 1915

The summer of 1914 changed the world. The Great War broke out. The Turkish government didn't want to fight, although it suspected that Russia would eventually attack Turkey. Besides, when the British government took over two newly built battleships that the Ottoman Empire had ordered to British shipyards: the Reshadiye (later known as HMS Erin) and the Sultan I Osman (later known as HMS Agincourt),  the Ottoman public opinion turned against Britain, too.

Meanwhile two German cruisers had made their way to Istanbul: the SMS Goeben and the SMS Breslau. Both ships were soon purchased by Ottoman Navy and, still manned by Germans, they improved the Turkish defences. Being on patrol, on October 29th, they spotted the Russian mine-layer Prut ready to lay mines near the Turkish coast. The mine-layer was sunk, the Ottoman cruisers devastated a few Russian ports as a retaliation and, as soon as the incident was known, on October 31st the Ottoman Empire declared war against Russia. 

A few days after the battle against the  Russian Navy, some British warships shelled the Ottoman Forts in the Dardanelles, without even a declaration of war. Then they announced that Misir (Egypt) was a part of their Empire. The Ottoman Army had no choice but to respond, and sent an expedition to cross the Suez Canal and liberate Misir. 

Orders: Took all victory hexes

Intelligence report: the Canal can be crossed only from ports (already existing or newly built by sappeurs). Reinforcements can be expected just before the BV limit expires.
Good Luck! 

This is scenario inspired by the initial battle of Patrick Steinmann's "The Last Crusade" campaign.
