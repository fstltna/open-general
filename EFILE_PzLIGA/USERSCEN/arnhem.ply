Operation "Market Garden"

The Allies launched operation MarketGarden, the largest airborn operation in history.
The plan was to thrust northward through occupied Holland, bypass the Siegfried-line, and advance into Germany east of Arnhem.  If all went well, the war would be over by Christmas!
In this scenario, the Allied objective is to secure the vital bridge over the Rhine at Malburgen, to liberate the cities of Eindhoven, Nijmegen, and Arnhem, and to hook up with the airborn divisions as soon as possible.
The German objective is to capture the Allied dropzones at Wolfheze and Groesbeek, and to secure and hold all the bridges over the river Maas.  
The rivers in Holland are Germany's last natural defences between the Allies and the Fatherland!
