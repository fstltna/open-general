War in the North - Battle of Bilbao - June 10th, 1937

Herr Oberstleutnant, General Franco has realized that Madrid is not going to be conquered quickly. In this prolonged war, the Basque resources of iron, coal, steel and chemicals are a tempting target. The Republican north is politically divided and weakened by struggles between Basque nationalists and leftists. Franco has ordered his commanders on the Madrid front to go on the defensive and send all available resources to the north. Basque forces have retreated inside Bilbao's Iron Ring. The Condor Legion will assist the National forces to overcome these defences.
