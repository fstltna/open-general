Gospodin General-Major, the Japanese 3rd Army has begun its siege of Port Arthur.  The first assault, launched between 6 (19) - 11 (24) of August 1904 cost the Japanese attackers 16,700 men: a quadrouple of our losses.  A second assault is imminent, and our swift advance through Korea is necessary to lift the siege.  You have opened the campaign to relieve Port Arthur successfully with your action on the Shakhe River:  you must maintain the initiative!
