Battle for the Grebbelinie - Loss

Herr General. you have failed us. Even though the Grebbelinie turned out to be defended by ill equiped and badly motivated Dutch troops, the line could not be penetrated. Luckily Student's troops and the ground troops coming to their assistence in the South were more successful reaching the main Dutch cities and forcing the Dutch to capitulate. 


HISTORY

The area in front of the Grebbe Mountain at Rhenen was not protected by flooded land, so the Dutch had strengthened the area with more troops, bunkers and artillery than in other parts of the line.
