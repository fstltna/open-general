TACTICAL VICTORY

The evacuation has been a success. Hundreds of thousands, both British as French, troops have been evacuated to England. Your force was among the last troops to embark. Sadly most equipement had to be left behind. However most of your equipement could be rescued.

The battle for France is not yet over! You will be transported back to France as soon as possible, mon General.
