19. TAMAN (25 September 1943)

Those were quite some days, comrade. Krasnodar and Novorossiysk have been liberated and the fascists cowards are fleeing towards the Taman peninsula where they should be evacuated to the Crimea. Our troops are close to exhausted but so is the enemy, and at least we are winning. The enemy will resist feriously but you should drive all the way west, until you have liberated the Kuban steppes totally!
