Onslaught of Low Countries

Part 1/3 of the "Westfeldzug" minicampaign


Herr Oberst! The Luftwaffe has just blown the bloody place! 

Victory conditions: After 10 turns hold four VHs for a BV, three for a V and two for a TV.

Hint: 
Find the way across the river and clear the area - capture as many VHs as possible - so that the bulk of our army does not lose time in the traffic jams and may use the secured passages.

Warning 1: Hold the two initial German VHs, if you lose them both, you'll lose the scenario. 

Warning 2: This scenario uses limited deployment, use the "View the Strategic Map" feature first!
