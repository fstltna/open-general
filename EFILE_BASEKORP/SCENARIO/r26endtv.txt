TACTICAL VICTORY

Bulgaria has switched sides and the Bulgarian Army, as the Rumanian Army, is fighting alongside us against the German fascists. You have done a worthy job.


AFTERMATH

Our glorious leader has not listened to your request for deployment in Yugoslavia to fight the fascists. You and your comrades have been fighting on the coasts of the Black Sea for over four years. They deserve rest and will not be called upon during this war again. And you, comrade, you will get a nice villa in the Crimea with view on your beloved Black Sea.
