There has been nothing that you could do. Let's hope that, with the help of the Germans, other divisions will be able to stop the Russians at Kowel. Their offensive will lose momentum and won't succeed.

However, it's quite obvious that if we keep on fighting in several fronts, we'll be doomed. Due to the Russian attacks, we've been forced to cancel our offensive against the treacherous Italians in the Alpen. Yes, we may have defeated Serbia, but that's not enough. And now things can get even worse. It seems that the Romanians, encouraged by the Russian offensive, are about to declare war on the Empire. Soon, we'll have a new enemy.
