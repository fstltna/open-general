  "Get those Panzers to Beaumont" 
 The order straight from the Fuhress.SS Gruppe 'Nyhauss was to join with other forces and encircle the French 4th and 8th Armee's.French Command was scratching their heads 'a Bunch of Girls playing 'Soldierrets were kicking their Ass',how could this be?The French were going to load the area with Heavy Armor and 'stop the Gals and End this once and for all'.Bad recon sent the French mass of steel too far and now there was a chance to get between it and between it's Command structure and supplies.In Berlin the Fuhress was getting reports the Air War was now even and soon the SS Air Korps would have the advantage as long as the Brits didn't throw everything they had into the conflict.In Paris there was requests for the RAF to show more numbers and especially more 'Spits.In London the Air-ministry had their hands bound and their tongues tied,Winston had to make sure England could be defended along with aiding Forces against the Italians besides 'Le Grande Armee' was the best in Europe and no bunch of Frau's dressed in Black with BdM armbands could possibly win.It was ludicrious,where in Time had Women been better than Men at War, Never.So far the SS had just been lucky and the French Command was bound to 'Rally the Legions' and defeat the Nazi's.
