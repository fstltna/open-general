Deutsches Afrika-Korps

Open General Version 1.0 - February 2011

1941 - ????

In 1941 the Italian Army was unable to face up to the British in Africa. After a year of disasters, they called for help from their German allies. Germany couldn't spare many resources to fight the British in Africa, so on February 12th 1941 they sent General Rommel plus the first German equipment and men to Tripoli.

Can you manage the Deutsches Afrika-Korps to victory, and better Rommel's achievements in Africa?.
