Afortunadamente hemos conseguido hacer una retirada ordenada y la mayor parte del Ejercito Popular ha cruzado en direccion contraria el rio Ebro.

Fortunately, you have managed to make a careful retreat to the other bank of the river, and most of the People's Army is now safe for the moment.  Unfortunately, careful retreats and saving what is left of our army will not defeat the Falangists.
