02. PUTO (4 January 1945)

Welcome at 11th Brigade, General! Our plan is, in general, to force the Japanese into the Bonis peninsula, opposite of the island of Buka, and then contain them so as to prevent attempts to reinforce their in the south. We will advance along the coastal track along the western coast north, step by step. The Japanese are likely to have small and large garrisons on key points along the way.

Our first goal will be the capture of the small village of Sipaai, and its airstrip so that RAAF 5 Squadron will be able to support you closely. One company has been advancing along the coastal track and has almost reached the Kaviki River without making contact with the enemy. The rest of your battalion will be landed at Sipaai and from there you are ordered to advance further north to capture Puto. Good luck, General! 

WARNING: Keep sailing your troops to the east. If you decide on going another way you may run into sea mines.
