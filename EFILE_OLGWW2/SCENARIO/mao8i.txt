Summer Offensive 1947

16-5-47, Jilin Province, NE China.

Orders from the central ChCP comitte: it's time to capture Changchun, Siping, and Jilin to complete the conquest of Manchuria. The success on this offensive is extremely important, because it would allow us to undertake further penetrations on to Beijing and Nanjing in the next months.

It won't be easy, the nationalists still have good units with good equipment, but we count on your elite units to deal with the Kuomingtan troops. The planned Summer Offensive must be victorious.
