
RAIL RAID - 8 Feb 1942

Railway between Mostar and Sarajevo, Bosnia
CO Commander Koca Popovic

Some German armored trains are on their way from Mostar to Belgrade. We will intercept and destroy two of them! Our plan is to isolate these two trains in an outlying area by blowing up the tracks and cut them off from help. Then it should be possible to destroy these trains by a concentrated attack of your forces.

Find and destroy 4 of 6 enemy MSUs and prevent the escape of any MSU via exit point. Isolate the enemy trains by blowing up the tracks before and behind them! 

Recommended Core:

3 x Partisan
3 x Regular
2 x MG-Infantry, Mules
2 x 75mm 75/13, Mules
1 x Light Cavalry
