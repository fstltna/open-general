Germans were particularly harsh during the Uprising and committed many atrocities, including murders of helpless civilians. Death toll of five days of fightings were some 1700 Czech insurgents, 700 insurgents of other nationalities, 300 men of ROA, 700 men of the Red Army and four thousand slain civilians. Germans lost one thousand men.

Most of the city was liberated on 9th May 1945, but there were lots of German snipers on rooftops, and those still killed people. Many other Germans flled westwards where they wished to enter American captivity, and those fought even several days after armistice.

The early years following the end of the war were bittersweet at best. Although the country was saved of the worst fate, Czechoslovakia still lost hundred thousands inhabitants, Subcarpathia was annexed by Soviet Union, industry was severely hampered.

Soon afterwards, things got even worse. The whole country fell slowly under Soviet influence. In 1946 a communist party won the elections and the inevitable was just a question of time. In February 1948 communists overthrown the government and gained power for the next fourty years.
When their rule ended, Czechoslovakia was economicaly devastated, its population demoralized, best of her sons and daughters killed, ruined or banished. A common state of Czechs and Slovaks disintegrated very fast and the decline of Czech society and state never stopped.

The soldiers of Czechoslovak army in the east fought many hard and bloody battles. Many of them had very bitter experiences with the communism and they despised it wholeheartedly.
During the final stages of war the 1st Czechoslovak Army Corps had some sixty thousand men and women. Road from Buzuluk to Prague is lined with graves of four thousands Czechoslovaks of all nationalities: Czechs, Slovaks, Jews, Rusyns...

Was their sacrifice in vain?
