크talca line - November 17th, 1912

Although battered and bruised, the Bulgarians have kept on their advance until the 크talca line, only 25 miles away from Istambul. Beyond our 크talca defences, only Edirne and a handful of villages still resist the allied offensive. So 크talca is, right now, our last line of defence against the enemy hordes.
After your past victories, you are clearly the right man to lead our resistance. You will have to defeat the inminent Bulgarian attack and, if possible, make a quick counterattack to retake some strategical positions. If the Bulgarian Army suffers enough casualties, they will be forced to negotiate the terms of peace, and Serbia and Greece won't have the strength to continue this war on their own.
One last thing: You will have to resist many enemies charging against our lines, so it may be wise to gather some extra artillery.

Orders: 
At the end of the scenario, holding 4 victory hexes gives you a brilliant victory. Hold 3 for victory and 2 for a tactical victory.

Intelligence report: Although our High Command has made desperate efforts to bring you fresh reinforcement troops from Anatolia, I regret to inform you that they won't arrive in time. You will have to deal with the Bulgarians with the forces that are currently available.
