Orel: Red storm

Oct 16th, 1919

Five days ago I assured you that the Reds were on the verge of panic. You could see with your own eyes how the survivors of their 13th Army ran for their lives when we took Orel. They know that their time is running out, but they also know that they won't find mercy in us. They'll be forced to fight until their bitter end.

Out of desperation the Bolsheviks have raised a Shock Group composed mainly of Latvians and Estonians. They want to outflank us, forcing us to retreat or to risk encirclement. It's amusing how they still underestimate you. Hold the line, my brothers, and show them that all their efforts are useless!

Victory conditions: 
- Take all the VHs.
