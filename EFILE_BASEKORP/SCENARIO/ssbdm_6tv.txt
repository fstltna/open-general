"Pitta how's it going"? "Oh the Dam French shot up most of the platoon, Me and Nance are all that's left and We had to High-tail our tanks right through a position of anti-tank guns.You should have seen the French running after firing a few shots at Us"."Just 2 of You left, You mean they got Trik's tank,did Betta Wohr survive"? "I don't know, It was too hot for Us to stick around.We moved to some trees but then the French artillery got our bearing and plastered the area so We had to move on.If Wohr survived she is probably a prisoner now.Hey where's the Fuel trucks, We are running on Fumes"? " You better enjoy those Fumes, that's all You are going to have for a while.Frau Pappan made a wrong turn and took them down a road straight into the Big Maginot guns, nothing left out of that mess.Sure when this is over they will demote Her, but She gets a kick off of living on the edge so don't think It will matter to Her"."That's just great, so We are suppose to sit here like a stump on a log as the Battle rages on"."If You could be so lucky, that Lunatic Lille is gathering up anybody She finds to take them on some hands on training as infantry,Close-Combat 101.If I was You I would take that tank and hide it somewhere in some trees and make a Bee-line back towards 'Tara's position,Her and Lille don't get along too good so You should be alright there"."Yeh Tara, that's right,She's the Luckiest Wench in this whole organization,I expect Her 1 day to get rid of ILse".
