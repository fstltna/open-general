War at the Marne: Belleau Wood

June 3rd, 1918

I hope that your defences are ready, because the Germans are already here, on the bank of the Marne.  Our mission is clear: we must halt their advance. Defeat isn't an option. If they cross the river, all the Western Front could fall. But it won't happen. They won't break through our lines.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the enemy VHs.
