 - Number of scenarios 11 so far ( more to come someday )
 - ROI-Efile based on OLGWW2

German Campaign on the russian southern front beginning right away in June 1941 till 1945

You will be commanding your troops under various armies on the southern front.
The goal is to have a battle every 2 months, so there might be 1 or 2 during Rasputiza
where action might be lower. Core army will be small in the the beginning and the cap 
will be increasing rather slowly. Aux units will be there if needed.

- No special rules. No mandatory units to win. There will be no trains nor ships.
- Time should be no problem as i´m not a fan of pushing units forward as fast as
- you can. Planes with the recon ability will be purchasable at any time
- 

Fight on.
