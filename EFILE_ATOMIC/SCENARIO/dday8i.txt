ORDERS: 

General, our next main objective will be the Rhine river. But before we can get closer to the Rhine, we have to keep our flanks save. You and your men are ordered to replace the 9th and 28th Infantry Divisions which entered the Hürtgen Forest, but were only able to make a little ground. Now they are worn down and entrenched in their positions.

The situation is critical! Mud and rain also take their toll. Maybe the germans are aware of our bad position and might launch a counterattack.

A few hints: 

The dense forest makes it hard to assign targets to our air force. This and the bad weather will hamper the use of planes in this operation.
