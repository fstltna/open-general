General,

You have disappointed us. If you are not able to retreat fresh troops, less will you able to command troops in the offensive.  

A new mission is waiting for you. Go to the canteen and let's hope you are able to cook a good "Waterzooi".

Le Chef d'Etat-major général de l’armée (EMGA).

Historical note:

This new retreat was a serious blow on the morale of the Belgian soldiers, who couldn’t understand why they had to retreat and leave not only the fortified position of the "KW line" but also Antwerpen/Anvers and the capital Bruxelles/Brussel.

The operation was a real challenge since the Belgian Army had to retreat in some cases 100 km, transport its ammo depots (a lot being destroyed/fired as it was not possible to transport it), use secondary roads (the main ones being used by French and British) packed with compatriot refugees, and all this under the constant presence of the Luftwaffe. 

In the Antwerpen/Anvers sector all Belgian divisions (12th, 13th and 15th infantry divisions) were attacked during their retreat by the German Army, in some cases suffering serious casualties, but eventually managed to retreat over the Escaut/Scheldt River.
