Herr Feldmarshall, we have an excellent opportunity to deliver a crushing blow to the enemy, here, north of Strasbourg. As you can see, the advance of the American Third Army has left this sector of 
their front inadequately defended. If you can knife through to Strasbourg, the Americans and British will be forced to halt their drive on the Fatherland. Good luck.
