Some enemy divisions are trapped at the southern tip of Cape May and refuse to surrender because they hope for their evacuation by sea. But they hope in vain! Despite our air and naval superiority our intelligence reports, that the desperate Americans have send a U.S. Navy formation, presumably to evaluate the chances of an evacuation and to support the besieged forces with naval artillery. You have order to chase off or destroy the U.S. Navy units with air and submarine forces while your ground units perform a frontal assault on Cape May and forcing the enemy to surrender!
