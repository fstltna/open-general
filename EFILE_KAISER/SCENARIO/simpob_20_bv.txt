The first phase of the Tobol offensive was a stunning victory for us. The 5th Army was routed and the survivors rushed to the river Tobol as fast as they could. 

We finally had the opportunity that we had been waiting for so long. We could keep on moving, cross the Tobol, encircle the Red Armies of the East, and destroy them. All we needed was an order.
