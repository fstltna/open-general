Good work Major! As you know, the Soviet Union has attacked us all along our front, but you managed to delay the Soviet attack in this sector just enough to allow us to begin the set up our defensive positions behind the Mannerheim line. Do not worry about the puppet government installed by Stalin in Terijoki, it does not and will not have the support of our people! Anyway, You and your men will now move North towards Tolvajarvi, where a counter offensive is being planned...
