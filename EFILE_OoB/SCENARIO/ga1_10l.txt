Historical Note: The Canadian Army's role in these final days of the war was to open up the supply route to the north through Arnhem, and then to clear the northeast and western Netherlands. Near Zutphen, Canadian soldiers liberated Stalag VI C, a camp for Russian POWs captured on the Eastern front. After occupying Zwolle, the Canadians then pressed on further north, but by then, the might of the Wehrmacht had been broken. Liberation Day, (Dutch: Bevrijdingsdag), is celebrated each year on May 5 in the Netherlands to mark the end of the German occupation during the Second World War. The nation was liberated largely by Canadian troops and to thank them each year, thousands of Tulip bulbs are sent to Ottawa where the annual May Tulip Festival is held.
