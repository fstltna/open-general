1939: 

The dilemma of the Wehrmacht's high command at the beginning of WW 2.

The first option, a Blitz over Poland mit already all free forces and the following transport of the troops in the west, really took place.
But: if the Allies would have attacked at once, the Reich would have been protected only insufficiently by the weak Westwall!

The second option, attacking Poland only with a part of the Wehrmacht and sending the rest at once to the potencial western front, would have possibly led to a vasting two-fronts-war.

This scenario tries to form the strategic situation on minimum space. For which option will YOU decide?
------------------------------------
scenario specific: the Wehrmacht must take all polish victory hexes for a german victory AND held ALL own victory hexes (in the west)!
Innovation: The players could play with an additional rule: Only polish units are allowed to be created at polish supply hexes.
