Alashkert, July 21 1915

Gospodin General-Leitenant, the Tukish 3rd Army (XI, Hamdi, IX, and Halil Corps) has escalated its offensive against our I and IV Kavkaz Corps.  With the IV Kavkaz Corps stretched from Alashkert to Tabriz, only the 2nd Kavkaz Cavalry (Abatsiev) and 66th divisions stand in the way of the Turkish onslaught toward Sarykamysh.  Sharpantier's cavalry group, having endured the forced march from Lake Urmia, has concentrated north of Lake Van.  Use the group's mobility to outflank the Turkish assault group.  You will also receive parts of Sharpantier's infantry arriving from the city of Van in barge transports a few days into the operation.

An Ottoman breakthrough at Alashkert would be an unthinkable tragedy for the Kavkaz Front, Gospodin General!
