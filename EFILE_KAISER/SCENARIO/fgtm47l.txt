During an eerie lull in the bombardment of your HQ positions by German 150mm howitzers, you had an opportunity to glance around your trench:  masses of German GardeInfanterie were assaulting your positions to the north and south.  The River Sereth glistened behind your back, and you could just make out German engineers building a pontoon bridge, sealing your fate on the western bank.

With your last battalion surrounded and your hands raised above your head with a white flag of surrender, you could not help but admire the efficiency of the attack that has shattered your offensive and your career.
