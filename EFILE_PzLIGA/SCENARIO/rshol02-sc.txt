Balikpapan

January, 1942

To continue our assault on the Dutch positions, you should strike a decisive blow to the ''KNIL'', the Dutch colonial forces.  The main ports and air bases are in the Balikpapan sector, what we need is to capture that sector.  This will allow us to complete this campaign.  Select carefully where you are going to disembark.  The area has plenty of sea mines and some coastal defenses.  Use your navy and air units to eliminate this threat.
