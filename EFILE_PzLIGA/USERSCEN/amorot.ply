Case Red

To: OB Panzergr., Gen. v.Kleist 
1.  After smashing the allied armies in Belgium and France, made possible by your bold operation, we now need to bring the campaign against France to a victorious conclusion.  
Your objective: to break through the enemy defenses in the Amiens theater south of the Somme.  Rapid annihilation of enemy forces, to enable a prompt advance to the Atlantic coast and a capture of the local harbors.
2.  Forces:  In addition to your reinforced armored group there will be various infantry divisions in your sector under your temporary command, as well as part of the Luftflotte II.
3.  Enemy forces:  Several infantry and cavallery groups in front, a French and a British armored group in reserve. The operational targets are in part well reinforced and supported by heavy artillery.  Careful!
You also have to expect intervention by the R.A.F. during your campaign.
