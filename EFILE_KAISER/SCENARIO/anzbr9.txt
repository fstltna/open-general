Brief to Anzac Commander.

Your objective is the fort of El Magdhaba. We are told it is defended by about 4000 troops with maybe some artillery. You will be assisted by a detachment of The Imperial Camel Corp and The Royal Flying Corp. Success is vital as the water at El Magdhaba will be needed for you and your horses. If you fail you will surely perish in the desert on your return trip!! You must upgrade all "Regular Infantry" units to "Light Horse" units. Only "Sappers" should remain as foot soliders.
