Schlacht um Riga

Sep 1st, 1917

We've been planning the conquer of Riga for a long time. Naturally, our aim is to hasten the fall of Russia and, in the short term, to straighten or own lines so that we can send some divisions to the Western Front. But we wish to test some new combat tactics, too. Instead of a frontal assault against the city, most of our units will cross the Düna and take positions at the enemy's rear, isolating Riga and preventing its defenders from receiving any reinforcements. If these infiltration tactics are successful, we could use them against the French or the British.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.
