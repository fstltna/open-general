03. ODESSA 1941 (13 August 1941)

Comrade, the situation is getting worse and worse. The Fascists are near Leningrad  and Smolensk in the north and Kiev in the south. Here, near the Black Sea coast, the Rumanian fascists with help of their German allies have advanced to the port of  Odessa which is an important base for our Black Sea Fleet. However we are encircled and cut off from land supplylines because the Germans are driving further and leaving the Rumanians to behind to capture Odessa. We will hold it as long as possible. Any supplies and reinforcements will be brought be sea from the Crimea. 

NOTE: You can only lose this scenario. Goal is to play the full 20 turns and keeping your core alive. Then the scenario will end and you will continue to the next scenario!

HINT: There is nothing to win, so do not hesitate to retreat to better defensive positions. Be sure to cover your forces with artillery and keep the artillery resupplied. They are vital for the survival of your units.
