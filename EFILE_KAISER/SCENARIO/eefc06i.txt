Rafa, 8th January 1917
------------------------------------- 
It has been decided to press our advance as rapidly as possible along the coast, and so by indirect pressure compel the Turks to retire from the Sinai highlands. As a preliminary step your troops will raid the Turkish force in position at El Magruntein Hill, close to the old Egyptian police post at Rafa.

There is some evidence to suggest that the Turks have established strong redoubts at the heights, so be prepared for a determined bayonet charge against their trenches. Our intelligence indicates that enemy reinforcements might come to help the Rafa outpost from Khan Yunis and from the east. Once again, speed is essential for our victory! Good luck!
