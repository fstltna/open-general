
ATTACK ON YUGOSLAVIA - 11 Apr 1941

Fiume, Italian-Yugoslavian-Border
CO General Vittorio Ambrosio

Welcome General! The transfer of your elite troops could be completed even still in time. The Germans start a attack on Yugoslavia in the last days. Now we must break through the Yugoslav border. Your target is Dubrovnik. The secret service reports you have to expect strong resistance. Good luck, General.
