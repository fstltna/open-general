Die Strafexpedition

May 15th, 1916

Now that the situation in the Balkans has improved, we can focus our efforts on getting rid of the Italians. So far, most of the fighting has taken place on the valley of the Isonzo River, and that means that one-half of the Italian army is currently deployed there. If we could take the mountains passes south of Trient and invade the plains of Vicenza and Verona, we'd cut their supply lines, the Italians would be trapped at the Isonzo, and we could force them to surrender. It could be the greatest victory in the history of the Empire.

We've tried to convince the Germans to support us, but they've refused to help. They think that they're already fighting the decisive battle of the war in Verdun, and they don't want to waste their time in what they consider a secondary front. It's a mistake. With Italy out of the war, we could send more troops to the east, and then the Germans could retire some of the divisions that they have currently there, and send them to France. Sometimes, having modest goals is better.

Well, never mind. We can do this without their help. Get your troops and prepare yourself. The moment of punishment for those treacherous Italians has come.
