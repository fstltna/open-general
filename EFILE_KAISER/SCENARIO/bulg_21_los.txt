You have performed far below our expectations. The Romanians still resist from Rasova to Kobadin. Besides, our attack at the Eastern sector has beed repelled. 
It's time to go back to our starting positions. It doesn't matter. We'll use the next weeks to reorganize our army and then we'll try again. The Rasova-Kobadin-Tuzla line will fall before the end of the year, be sure of that.
Right now there are other problems to worry about. We fear that the Romanians are preparing an offensive across the Dunav River, on our rear. You'll have to go there and reinforce the local garrisons.
