Trenches at Janzour - Loss

Disaster. We lost thousands of men and the Italians vastly extended their area of control around Trablus.

Historical outcome of the battle
The flanking maneuver of the Ottoman cavalry was spotted by two Italian airships. These airships also carried out bombardments of the enemy troops. The Italians - draging a few pieces of heavy artillery from Tripoli and towing light artillery with light Fiat trucks - were able to chase the Ottoman forces out of Janzour and from Abd Al Jalil hill. Italian casualties were 43 killed, 278 wounded. Ottomen casualties are estimated at around 2000.

Outcome of the war
Getting frustrated that they were not able to bring a quick end to the war in Libya, the Italians sought and got permission from the great powers to attack Turkish possessions in the Aegean Sea. These developments forced Turkey to sign the First Treaty of Lozanne that gave Italy control over Libya.
