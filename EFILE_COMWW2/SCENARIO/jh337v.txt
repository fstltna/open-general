Congratulations, Herr General.  Your troops have successfully cleared a corridor to our comrades in Sixth Army. We will be able to continue to send reinforcements and supplies to our brave men.  However we have a new and urgent assignment for you. Intelligence indicate that the Western Allies are planning a landing in Northwest Afrika.  The General Staff has decided to send significant reinforcements to the Afrika Corps, so you and your men are to transfer to Afrika after a thorough rest and refitting.
