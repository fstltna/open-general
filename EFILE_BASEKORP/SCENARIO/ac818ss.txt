Herr General, come in!

You must know by now that the Stalingrad problem has become even more precarious.  Manstein is forming an attack group that will re-establish contact with 6th Army, however we also know of another Red Army offensive in the vicinity of our own Italian 8th Army.

Manstein's staff will meet tommorrow, they are undecided on where to send your corps, YOU can most likely tilt the decision if you press your opinion.

STAFF INTEL: Choose to get a VICTORY to join 4th Panzer Army's attack to establish contact with 6th army - OR - Choose a TACTICAL VICTORY to reinforce our Italian 8th Army's defense of the Don.
