Commander, the Japanese strike on the Philippines has overwhelmed our resources. General MacArthur desperately needs time to regroup his battered forces at Bataan. You must take your troops and your Filipino Trainees and drive back the main Japanese thrust at Lingayen Gulf. We know that there is little hope of ultimate victory, but if you can drive the invaders back temporarily, many troops can be evacuated to fight on another day. Good Luck, Commander.
