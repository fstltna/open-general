Changteh

November, 1943

You are again needed for and important mission; you are our best general here in China. The Burmese front remains quiet, and we need your leadership on this mission.  The morale of our men is really low in China, the constant retreats, and attacks have had a negative effect, and we need a decisive victory.  Your task is to seize the city of Changteh.  If we can get all our goals in this ambitious operation, we will be able to do further penetrations into the Chinese heartland, and possibly to end the war in China...
