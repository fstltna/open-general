 TACTICAL VICTORY
------------------------------------------
After the Medean Pass had been secured, we crossed the Libyan border and defeated the Senussi at Bir Asiso. We captured no less than forty enemy guns and machine guns, took three Turkish officers and hundreds of Senussi prisoners. Now let the Duke's armoured cars round up the enemy stragglers. 
As a result, we have eliminated the threat to Egypt and the Suez Canal from the Turkish supported attacks from the west.
