Stop everything, this is an emergency.

The British have copied us and have created - you'll never guess - an amphibious assault force. Which is currently assaulting our vital harbor of Le Havre! *Our* French coast!...
This is a public relations disaster: We can't have people think anyone can attack us, there would be chaos.
We don't know yet if they are just testing us or if they really plan on invading France, but in both cases you need to stop them - Now!

Apparently their force is lead by some Commodore Weatherly or Weatherby, please make sure he goes down with his ship. We are not to encourage this, you need to teach those people a lesson once and for all. Go!

Ah, and lest I forget - Don't let them capture the Kommandantur building, it contains a stock of top secret Enigma machines. Defend that building at all cost.




Instructions: Get rid of the enemies, don't lose the Kommandantur building. The local garnison is trying to contain the British, but they are untrained and badly equipped reserve troops, they won't hold for long. Reinforcements are coming, but given the weather they won't be here for a couple days.
