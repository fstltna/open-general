When we finally stopped to rest and regroup, the First and the Fith Soviet Armies had been virtually destroyed. In the north, the Siberians had met moderate success, too. We had reasons to be optimistic.

However, in the south, the cossacks, outnumbered, without adequate equipment, and isolated from the rest of our army, hadn't been able to take Orenburg. If the Reds kept that city they would threaten our left flank, and it would be very dangerous to continue our race to the Volga, so Kolchak ordered us to go south and help the cossacks to occupy Orenburg at all costs.
