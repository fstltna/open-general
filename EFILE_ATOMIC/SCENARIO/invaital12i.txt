Orders:

We are facing the last of the German major defence lines now, the Gotic Line, in the northern part of the Apennine Mountains. Your orders are to fight your way through the enemy lines and reach the pass roads which lead through the mountains to the Po valley.

Recently the Brazilian Expeditionary Force arrived in Italy and is ready for battle now. Parts of the Brazilian 1. Infantry Division as well as a fighter squadron will join your core troops.
