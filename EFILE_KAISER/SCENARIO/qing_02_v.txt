Lang Son was an outstanding victory, maybe the most brilliant military action of the Qing Army in more than a century. In just four days the Chinese troops routed the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps. The French units panicked, fleeing to Chu and later to Hanoi, the only town where they thought they would be safe.

Most of northern Tonkin was now in Chinese hands, except for Tuyen Quang, where a French contingent had been besieged since November of 1884. Desperately in need for a victory that could make them recover their morale, the French decided to send a relief column to Tuyen Quang and rescue their defenders. Naturally, the Chinese would do their best to thwart the enemy's plans.
