Roterturmpass - September, 1916 - Loss

Oberstleutnant, your men fought bravely, but the Romanians were able to push our troops aside and retreat over the Carpathians. We liberated Transylvania, but our victory has not been as complete as expected. Now that we will continue our offensive into Romania, I hope that this missed opportunity will not cost us dearly in the future.
