General, the main imperial forces are advancing alongside the Danube, but the Court wants to encircle these rebel Hungarians from all sides. Puchner will attack from Southern-Transylvania, Jellachic from Syrmia, and your troops have crossed the Dukla-pass from Galicia. General, take Kassa as soon as possible, and close the escape route of Görgei, who is still maneuvering in the North-Carpathians.
