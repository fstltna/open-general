
MULHOUSE II - 20 NOV 1944

The battle for Mulhouse is far from over. Significant pockets of Germans remain north and west of the city, who have already regrouped and attacked south over the canal. You should counterattack the Germans while keeping your supply lines open. 

GOAL: Take all VH's!

NOTE:It is very important that you defend the area between Altkirch and Sochaul (the 4 victory hexes south of the Canal); if the Germans control these hexes (as well as hex 25,19) at any point you lose.
