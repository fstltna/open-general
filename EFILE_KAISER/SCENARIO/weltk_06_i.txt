Verdun: Unternehmen Gericht 

Feb 21st, 1916

Attrition. That's the ultimate goal of our new operation. We can't break through the Entente lines, nor can we defend ourselves forever. So we'll set a trap for the French Army. We'll launch an offensive against Verdun and its ring of forts. Naturally, taking the town would be very important, but what the OHL really wants is forcing the French to counterattack in order to retake the lost terrain. Then we'll be able to annihilate them with our artillery fire, standing on safe positions.

If the plan goes well the French will lose most of their reserves, and then they'll be forced to accept our peace conditions. And even if they don't, at the very least they'll be so weakened that we'll be able to launch a new offensive to pierce their defences and take Paris once and for all. As you see, its vital that our first wave, that you'll command, succeeds at breaking the French defence line and at taking the strategic points that we'll need to carry out the second phase of the operation. 

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.

Special note: From now on your new units will start with 99 exp.
