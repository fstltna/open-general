Tired of running in a maze like a rodent? Lets play the outflanking game!

The playing field is flat, almost featureless. You have an inaccessible VH and airport, which means you can't lose because of the enemy taking your VHs. But you can lose because your troops got killed... Obviously the enemy has lots of units, you'd better avoid facing them all on the same time. Remember, your troops are fast and agile.

A piece of advice: Starting now you'll also be facing tanks. Weak tanks to start with, but tanks nevertheless; Buy some more units able to fight/resist tanks.
You also get a free core recon tank.

There are two Bonus Bunkers in the game again. Even if you decide to not attack them, beware of their firepower, for this time they are not hidden in some remote corner anymore.

(Last but not least a heads up: There is a bad surprise on this map. But also a couple nice ones...)
