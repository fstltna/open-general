High Command has given you command of a Panzerbrigade. This is a huge honor for someone with as little experience as you, so be aware you'll have to live up to the honor.

Your troops are to lead the assault in this region. Beware, there will be several rivers to cross in the next weeks. And a handfull of fortified cities to take.

On the other hand we expect to take the Russians by surprise, and thus expect for quite some time little to no real resistance. This will be a chance to get our troops a little training before things start getting ugly.
All right, dismissed. Go get them, Moscow awaits!



Instructions: Capture all VHs.
