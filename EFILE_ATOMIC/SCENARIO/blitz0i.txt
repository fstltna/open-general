SITUATION:

Ah, Good day, Herr General! Please sit down and allow me to explain the present situation. The Spanish Nationalists have requested the help of Germany to wrest control of Spain from their enemies. In leading this expedition, you will have the opportunity to sharpen your skills in the art of war. You will test the General Staff's new ideas regarding tank use, concentration of force, and combined arms operations. Your expertise can then be put to work towards the real objective: the return of Germany to its proper place, the leader of Europe.
