The Battle of Arras, Vimy Ridge - April 11, 1917 - BV

Well done General. Vimy Ridge is in our hands and the Canadian corps has suffered a bloody nose. 

Historical events:
The purpose of the Arras offensive was to draw in German reinforcements. It thereby assisted the French Nivelle Offensive that would start a few days later.
- March 20: Bombardment of Vimy Ridge starts.
- April 4: Bombardment on rest of the Arras sector starts.
- April 9: Attacks East of Arras and at Vimy Ridge were successful, with spectacular gains.
- April 10: The attack at Bullecourt was repulsed by the Germans.
- 2nd half April & May: After a brief pauze the British resumed their attacks. All failed against the German elastic defense. Also the Nivelle offensive failed.

The failure of the Nivelle strategy and the high number of French casualties led to mutinies and the dismissal of Nivelle, his replacement by Pétain and the adoption of a defensive strategy while the French army recuperated.
