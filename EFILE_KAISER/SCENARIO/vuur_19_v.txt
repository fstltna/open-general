Your victory has been complete. Kitchener has died in battle and when news of this new British defeat arrived in Kaapstad a rebellion started among the Afrikaner population of the city. Governor Milner panicked and he has left the country.

In England the Marquess of Salisbury has been forced to resign as Prime Minister and his successor, Arthur Balfour, has agreed to start peace negotiations. They're willing to acknowledge the full independence of our republics and to state that they will stop messing in our internal affairs, including the issue with the uitlanders. President Kruger would be satisfied with that, but most of our generals believe that we should ask for more. Many claim for the annexation of Natal, and Louis Botha even dreams of a South African Union under Afrikaner control and free from any influence of the British Empire. Which side will you support? You're one of the greatest heroes of this country, and your opinion will be greatly valued. Maybe your next destination will be politics.

The campaign is over. I hope you've liked it and thanks for playing.
