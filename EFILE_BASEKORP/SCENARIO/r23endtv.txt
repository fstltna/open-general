TACTICAL VICTORY

Brilliant, comrade. The Red Army has encircled many fascist formations. We expect to have encircled over 20 German divisions at least. And our advance into Rumania is going quick, victory should be near. In the Baltic and Byelorussia we have advanced over hundreds of kilometers. Our nation is close to being completely liberated from the fascist supression!
