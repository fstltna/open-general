The Russians are retreating, not only here in Limanowa, but in other sectors, too. That's good. They will never have another chance to take Krakau.

Sadly, our victory isn't complete. Our enemies still threaten the south eastern mountain passes that lead to the Hungarian Plains and, worst of all, in these past days we've been forced to use our last reserves. Our troops are exhausted and can't go on with the counteroffensive. That means that we won't be able to help the defenders of Premissel, at least for now.

In the Balkans things have gone badly, too. The Serbians overcame us, and forced us to retreat to the Drina. After six months of fighting, a tiny kingdom has defeated us.

Before the war started, we all knew that our army needed some important reforms, better funding, modern equipment and proper training and leadership, but nobody could foresee this disaster. We thought that what we had was enough to beat Serbia and, at the very least, to hold the Russians for some months.

Reality was very different, though. Well, now we know how weak we are. And our enemies know it, too. The following months will be terrible for the Empire. We must prepare ourselves for a long, ugly war. On the positive side, Russia has suffered greatly during this year, too, so I think that, working together with the Germans, we should be able to recover all the territories that we've lost.
