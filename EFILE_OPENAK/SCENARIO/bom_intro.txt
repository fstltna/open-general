The Battle of Mokra

The Battle of Mokra took place on September 1, 1939 near the village of Mokra, 5 km north from Klobuck, 23 km north-west from Czestochowa, Poland. It was one of the first battles of the Invasion of Poland, of the Second World War and one of the few Polish victories of that campaign.
The German 4th Panzer Division was forced back to its initial positions in Opatów and Wilkowiecko, and only the 12th Schützen Regiment managed to reach the rail road crossing at Izbiska. However, upon learning that the German 1st Panzer Division had managed to take Klobuck, the Polish forces were withdrawn overnight south-eastwards, to the village of Lobodno located north-east of Klobuck, and then to the second line of defence, some 12 km to the east.
The losses on both sides were quite high. The Germans lost approximately 800 men (killed, missing, captured or seriously wounded), and between 100 and 160 AFVs (at least 50 of them tanks). The Polish brigade lost 200 killed and 300 wounded, as well as 300 horses and several guns. The 2nd Mounted Artillery Battalion lost almost 30% of men, the 21st Regiment - almost 25%; the 12th Uhlans Regiment that was used as a reserve lost 5 officers and 216 men, both killed and wounded.
