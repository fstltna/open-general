Paranoid Patrol
Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico
April 6th, 1954

A small A.O. recon unit investigates reports of heavy armor in the jungles of the Yucatan.  They must push north to the rendevous cabin.  If heavy resistance is evident, the A.O. unit should attempt to secure the northernmost supply point and bring in the entirety of existing A.O. reserves.  Blake's men must survive.
