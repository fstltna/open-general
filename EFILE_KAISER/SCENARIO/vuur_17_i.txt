Second Battle of Colenso

April 19th, 1900

Welcome to Natal, General. The news of the war are excellent. Thanks to you a great portion of the coast is in our hands, Cronjé has finally conquered Mafikeng and De Wet has joined Botha's forces. Now it's time to deal with Buller's army.

Buller's plan is crossing the Drakensberge and invading the Orange Free State, forcing us to fight in our own territory. He receives supplies from the port of Durban regularly, so he's by no means isolated. But Botha is resisting him fiercely, so most of the British soldiers and resources have been sent to the mountains. In fact, the British defences on the Tugela Valley are weaker now than they were when the year started.

I can't blame Buller for this poor planning. After all, he couldn't expect that you would be here so soon. But if you take Colenso and Ladysmith before he can react, you'll cut his supply lines, his army will be trapped in Northern Natal and his situation will become hopeless. Our final victory will be one step closer.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.
- Your MSU must survive.
