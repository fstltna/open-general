Report to the Fuhress on the World condition (July '39)  Our SS numbers have now reached 3.2 million Fraus.The French still have a formidable force.To beat them may take the rest of the year.'IL Duce has agreed to step up operations in North Afrika to pull Allied reserves there.Canada ,Netherland will join the Allies cause soon We believe.Poland is leaning towards joining but Russian armor forces on the border have them indecisive as well as the SS forces of Armee 'Erfert in East Prussia.The 'War Cabinet' has made the request 'Erfert should move and take Danzig/Gdynia so no supplies can come ashore in the area.This will make the decision for the Poles a little simpler but We need them off Our flanks as We move more forces West.Japan is reluctant for the request of more attacks on Russia,it seems they are moving to create their Co-prosperity Sphere in the Pacific.We have stated again "The Russians are the Real War".Sooner or later the great Industrial Giant,the United States will have to get involved.At the moment Our Gestapa spys say they see no movement in American industry turning to War,they still have Cars and Refridgerators coming off the Assembly line.As far as Our industrial mite We are in better shape than ever but We cannot fight the whole World.We need to beat the French and Brits first.We can do that.Then the Soviets which with their vast areas to cross will be a greater task.Europe can be Ours but We must not get involved with Amerika before then.
