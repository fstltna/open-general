The French have defeated you. Now their counterattack is imminent, but at least our starting positions are solidly defended. The fighting in Hartmannsweilerkopf isn't over. There will be many skirmishes in the following months until the front stabilizes again.

After seeing your performance I think that it would be better to keep you on a secondary front until the end of the war. However, the OHL has decided that you and your men will be transferred to the Belgian border. I can't understand why, maybe they think that there you're most likely to be killed in action. Anyway, I wish you good luck, General, you'll need it on your new destination.
