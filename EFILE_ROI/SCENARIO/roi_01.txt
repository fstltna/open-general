Sculeni - 22-06-1941

Good evening Sir. You and your forces are under the command of
Generalmajor Röttig.

A quiet beginning of the war for the 11th army with her 198. ID
On the evening of the 22-06-1941 you exceed the river Pruth
and take Sculeni.

Build a bridge at hex 14,16 with the pioneers if you like. This was intended as a
test for a forced bridge building. As of now the build feature will be disabled for
the rest of the campaign.

Proto possible after this one.
