20. 4. 1848, Prologue: Knechtschaft oder Revolution! (Slavery or Revolution!)


Lieber Freund,
not much time to write, hastily a short note for you:
I joined Friedrich Hecker who is negotiating at the moment with prussian general Friedrich von Gagen.
Von Gagen wants unconditional surrender which we never will accept.
But still we are not enough men, so we have to flee from here. At Rhine and Neckar we will surely find a lot of supporters...


ORDERS:
Save Friedrich Hecker or the Revolution will be lost!

ADVICE FROM YOUR OLDEST SERGEANT:
It is important for us to gain experience but we should withdraw to the east....!
