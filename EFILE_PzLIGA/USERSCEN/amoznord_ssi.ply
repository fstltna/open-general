Citadel North 1.05

In July, 1943, the Wehrmacht formed up for 'Operation Citadel' in the North and South of the Kursk salient.
In the North, at Ponyrii and MaloArchangelsk, Model's 9th Army assaulted the positions of the 70th and 13th Armies of Rokossovski's Central Front.

After only a few days the Germans got stuck in the deeply echeloned Soviet positions. When the Soviets started a counter-offensive in the North at Orel, the 9th Army had to abandon 'Citadel'. ____________________________________________________________ 
Can you, as Model, break through, nevertheless? Or will you, as Rokossovski, triumph over the Fascists?  ___________________________________________________________
