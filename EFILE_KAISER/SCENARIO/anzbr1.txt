Brief to Anzac Commander.

The Russians have asked us for supplies and an attack on Turkey to relieve the pressure on their front line. We know that the Turks have formidible coastal guns guarding the Dardanelle Strait which is the supply line to southern Russia. You are to sail a squadron of Royal Navy and French warships up the strait and destroy these guns so the way is open for our fleet to attack Constantinople and force a Turkish surrender.
