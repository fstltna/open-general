ARDENNES COUNTERATTACK
December 25th, 1944

Merry bloody Christmas.

A German attack through the Ardennes forest, while initially achieving some success against the thinly held American lines, has now effectively been halted.  The Germans have outrun their supply lines, and are thus experiencing huge shortages of fuel, ammunition and other vital supplies.  It is at this juncture that we will go onto the attack.  You will cross the bridge at Dinant and assist the U.S. 2nd Armoured Division in reducing the German bulge.
