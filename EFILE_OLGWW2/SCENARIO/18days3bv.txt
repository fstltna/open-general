General,

Well done! You have succeeded in safely retreating our troops from the Ardennes to be redeployed in the "Ligne KW" (Dyle position). 

However, the Germans have managed to quickly cross the Ardennes in spite of the French troops sent to delay this movement. 

We already warned our allies some months ago but the French strategists considered the region impracticable for motorized troops (sic).

A new mission is waiting for you.

Le Chef d'Etat-major général de l’armée (EMGA).

Historical note:

In its advance through the Ardennes German II and XIX Panzercorps had to face fierce resistance from small Belgian detachments of "Chasseusr Ardennaises/Ardense Jagers" in many places (Martelange, Bodange, Strainchamps, Chabrehez) causing important delays. The Germans were so surprised that they lost so much time because of these small units that destroyed all documents so their superiors couldn’t find out what happened. Both Guderain and Rommel would later praise the effective destructions and delaying tactics the Belgian army performed and would call them the "Grey Wolves".

Meanwhile French light troops intervened in the Neufchateau area but were forced to retreat behind the Maas River.

In spite of the delays, Germans reached the Maas river faster than the French 9th and 2nd Army. Therefore the bridges over the river had to be destroyed by Belgian troops.

One of the reasons for the rapid German advance was the lack of cooperation between the Belgian and French troops. Both troops executed their plans without looking at what the other was doing, causing many disagreements and incidents.
