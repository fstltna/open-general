The Romanian front: Marasesti

Aug 6th, 1917

We have reasons to be optimistic at the Eastern front. Of course, that doesn't mean that we haven't suffered any setbacks lately. The worst of all was the death of our beloved Kaiser Franz Joseph in November. His successor, Karl I, wishes that we could make peace with our enemies. But, sadly, that's an impossible dream. France and the United Kingdom want to hear nothing of that. Our only chance is to keep on fighting, and to do our best.

The good thing is that Russia is falling apart. Who could have foreseen that a revolution would succeed in that once mighty empire? Nobody. Instead, here you have it: the Zar has been dethroned, and the country is run by a bunch of weak liberals. If they were true patriots, or at least if they had some common sense, they would seek to make peace with us, and try to rebuild their country. But they're just a pathetic band of British puppets, so they won't do anything of that.

You already know what happened: their summer offensive in Galizien was a complete disaster. Nevertheless, the Romanians saw it as an opportunity to retake the initiative. They launched a minor offensive in Marasti, and the truth is that defeated our first line troops.

Now that the Romanian assault has lost momentum, it's time for our counterattack near Marasesti. The Russian 4th Army and the Romanian 1st Army haven't had time to build a defence line, so you have a good chance to crush them. Do it, and our total victory in the east will be much closer.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.
