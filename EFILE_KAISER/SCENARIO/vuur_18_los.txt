I'm very sorry, Nonnie. Your heroic husband died four days ago, fighting in Natal. We had found very strong enemy resistance and he decided to lead a group of men to outflank them and capture his cannons. He ultimately succeeded, but the shrapnel from one of the last enemy shots hit him, killing him instantly. We have lost one of our most capable generals, and the blow to the morale of the troops is immense. Now we must find the strength to recover from his loss.
