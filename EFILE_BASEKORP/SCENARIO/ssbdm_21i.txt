   'Forest of Inndohr'  07/06/41
  Leningrads capture was celebrated of course as a Big acheivement in the War being 1 of the 5 main focus points the others being Smolensk,Kharkov,Rostav and of course the prize,Moscow.The Soviet land so vast and the Forces so immense those Bolshevik units that were able to retreat or escape just moved into woods,re-organized and hounded the Nazi Invaders.Supply units of the SS/BdM could not do their job or could the Panzers roll forward until the Forest of Inndohr was cleared out.And Panzers could not dominate the battles in woods,it took the 'Fraus in great numbers which also meant great casulties.So unlike France the Dead and maimed were going to be in the 100's of thousands before the Crusade against the Bolsheviks was over.In the Reich a lot of Families would not celebrate the Greatness of the Fuhress attacking Russia as they had of the Fall of France and Englands demise.And the Fuhress repeating Her famous line 'It is a Necessity' would irk those who would lose their Daughters in Service of the Frauland far away on the Eastern Front.
