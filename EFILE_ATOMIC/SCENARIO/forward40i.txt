Brody Cauldron
With your advance the encirclement of six German and Hungarian divisions is complete. We know that the Germans will try to break out of the pocket. You have to prevent that troops of the axis can escape over the river into the west and you have to destroy most of the enemies troops.
Your troops: 
Some troops of the 1st Ukrainian Front will assist you by your mission.
Enemy troops:
You are facing the XIII Army Corps. The enemy is under strenght and has only some seroius tanks. With a good front is should be easy to repel the breakout.
