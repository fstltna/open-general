*** CZECH LEGION - SIBERIAN ANABASIS ***

Our beloved lands of Bohemia and Moravia have been under Habsburg control for centuries. Now, during the World War, the time has come to liberate ourselves and rule our own country ourselves!

The Habsburg K.u.K Army has suffered tremendous losses ever since 1914 and of the hundreds of thousands prisoners, a considerable number of Czech were part of that. Our political leaders, like Masaryk and Durich, have received permission from the Russian Tsar to form a Czech Legion. In 1916 two Czech regiments were formed. Early 1917 a revolution takes place in Russia which forces the Tsar to abdicate. Under the new government, lead by Kerensky, Russia continues the war against Austria-Hungary and the Germany. The Czech Legion is expanded to brigade size and is deployed at the southern front against the Austro-Hungarian K.u.K Army in the area of Zborow when Kerensky orders an offensive.

The Czech Legion will take part in the Kerensky Offensive, lead by the 1916 hero Brusilov. The goal is to capture Lemberg and Kowel. The Czech Legion receives orders to capture the village of Pluhiv after breaking through the Austro-Hungarian trenches.

The Czech Legion is deployed in between the Finnish 6th and 4th divisions. The Austro-Hungarian forces consist of the K.u.K. 19th infantry division which consists roughly of half of Czechs... Success is vital!
