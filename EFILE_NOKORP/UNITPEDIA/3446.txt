The predecessor formation to the Brandenburg Division.
Created before the invasion of Poland, the Battalion Ebbinghaus was made of small fighting squads of volunteer Polish-speaking Silesians and ethnic Germans supposed to occupy key positions and hold them until the arrival of regular Wehrmacht units. They answered to the Abwehr (Intelligence), but were led by army officers.
After the invasion of Poland they were integrated in the Wehrmacht.
