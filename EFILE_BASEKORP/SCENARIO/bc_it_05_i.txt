OPERATION GOODWOOD
July 17th, 1944

The current plan for Normandy is for an American breakthrough in the west, to be made possible by an attritional battle here in the east, to draw away German reserves.  For this plan to work, we need to secure Bourgebus ridge to the south of Caen.  This will then draw in whatever German reserves remain into this battle, preventing them being used to counter the U.S. forces in the west.
