Historical info:

The channel islands were under german occupation from 30 June 1940 until 9 May 1945. Prior to their occupation, the channel islands had been demilitarised and declared 'open towns' and thousands of civilians were evacuated. The channel islands were part of the german Atlantikwall and thousands of slave workers built fortifications and coastal artillery bunkers. On 9 May 1945, when the war was over, HMS Bulldog arrived at St Peter Port on Guernsey, greeted by a joyous but malnurished crowd singing patriotic songs.
