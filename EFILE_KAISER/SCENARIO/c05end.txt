You have fended off disaster, comrade.  The Poles conducted a flanking attack on Brody while our eyes were pointed only on getting to Lwow.  You stabilized the situation!

On the other side, it was sarcastic that you had to encounter the treacherous Don Cossacks again that left our side at Volodarka.  If they had only known that the Revolution cannot be turned around.  We will make sure they know now.

Keep advancing towards Lwow.  It is not far now!
