The Ottoman Empire will last a little longer, I guess. The British have stopped their advance, and in fact they're retreating in certain areas. It seems that they've been informed that they won't receive any fresh troops from Europe or India any time soon because now the British priority is the defence of France, so Allenby has decided to dig in in Palestine. The Orient-Korps should take advantage of the current British vulnerability, don't you think? You should resume your counteroffensive as soon as you can.
