13. OPERATION PRODUCT (21 July 1947)

STRATEGIC SITUATION:
The aftermath of World War 2 is just beginning. As soon as the war ends, many colonies of European powers, including our Dutch East Indies, are in uprising and demanding independance.

Indonesian nationalists on Java have declared the independance of the new Republic of Indonesia soon after Japan had surrendered. Japanese forces maintained law and order as best as possible until the British could take over. But they have not been succesful in doing so. We have agreed to a treaty with the Indonesian nationalists. However on both sides there have been misinterpretations of this treaty of Linggadjati. But we will not stand looking. We will take action. Operation Product will occupy the main economic regions on Java!

TACTICAL ORDERS:
Your division is deployed on western Java, south of the capital of Batavia. The Indonesian TNI Army is occupying the Sukabumi region. You will take and pacify this region. You are on your own because most forces are committed to actions on eastern Java.
