You suffered a terrible defeat. 

The civilians are captured and some of your units destroyed. Under these conditions you are unable to continue the war and must surrender your forces to the British.


Historic aftermath: British troops landed in a swamp where they were stopped by fire from the German troops. The raid lasted two days and then the German troops evacuated the town. Casualties for both sides were light. After the retreat of the German troops, the British destroyed the fort and the wireless station. Some units were granted permission to loot the town, but this soon got out of hand.  There was much burning, robbing and destruction.  Due to this incident the British changed commanders and appointed General Smuts as head of their forces.
