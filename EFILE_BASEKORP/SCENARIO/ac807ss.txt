Come in General, have some cold water.

The British have been taken by strategic surprise by Hungary and Romania's declaration to the Axis!  We have an opportunity to strike them here with a bold attack and chase them all the way to Tobruk.... then Egypt!

Mussilini thinks you are the man for the job.  He told me he needed someone bold and aggressive....and General, I told him you were reckless.

Simply put, we can not fail here, the British are sending more troops to this region every day after their failure in France...but let us part with a positive note...See you in Tobruk!

STAFF INTEL: The British line is thin but tough.  We can expect them to maneuver little and the distances are great thus our speed is essential.  When attacking, we'll need to have local mass to be successful.
