Once again the Boer retreated in order after causing us some casualties. We had to spend some days recovering from this fight, giving our enemies enough time to finish their defence line at Magersfontein.
However, we were lucky. If the Boer had followed de la Rey's plan to the letter they would have waited for us to come closer before opening fire, surprising us completely. Our whole division could have been in great danger, but fortunately for us they used their rifles too soon.
