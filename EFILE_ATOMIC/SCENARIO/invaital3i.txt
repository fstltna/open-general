Orders:

The bulk of the Axis army is retreating towards Messina leaving the rest of Sicily only lightly defended. You should keep up the momentum and advance northwest as fast as possible in order to capture a large part of Sicily.

Notes:

We lost some of our seaborn recon planes to Bf 109s and Fw190s. Expect a strong axis air force!
At this stage of Operation Husky you should not try to capture the northeastern part of Sicily. We have to secure the western part of the island first.
