Second Battle of Port Elizabeth

June 8th, 1900

The time has come for retaking Port Elizabeth and Port Alfred. The British are still obsessed with the defence of Kaapstad, so they have sent just two divisions to this area. However, defeating them isn't going to be an easy task. While you were fighting in Natal Kitchener managed to build a strong line of blockhouses to protect the mountain passes. And at least three British battleships patrol the coast in order to give support to the defenders of the main towns.

As I've said, it won't be easy, but we can't let the Rooineks retake the initiative. Get your troops, storm the enemy defences, and take control of the coast. That could be the last blow for the British.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.
- Your MSU must survive.
