Smashing the Chinese defenses at Almaty was an impressive opening to your upcoming Siberian offensive. It gave the newly rebuilt Russian army the confidence it needed. Advancing from Ekaterinburg, the Russians recaptured much of the Siberian Lowland and restored operation of the Trans-Siberian Railroad up to the Ob River. The People’s Republic of China, on the other hand, has been thrown completely off-balance by your victory.
