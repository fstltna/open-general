Herr General,

With 8th army crushed we now only have three American bridgeheads left on Sicily. Two of these have linked up. So far we have been able to contain these by retreating to hills out of range of the naval artillery barrage. 

With your support we should now be able to attack and crush the Americans. If you are victorious the threat of a new allied invasion of Italy will be gone for at least half a year, meaning we can redeploy your troops elsewhere.
