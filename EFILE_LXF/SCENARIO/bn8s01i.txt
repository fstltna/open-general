THE STORY

The uprising in Serbia was successful and secured a defensible, self-sustained, independent region, the first of many "free territories" to be established by the Partisans during the course of the war, and was commonly called the "Uzice Republic".

Mid-September 1941 Nebojsa Jerkovic, a commander of Macva partisan detachment, visited Chetnik captain Dragoslav Racic, a commander of Cer Corp in order to reach agreement on joint attack on Sabac. Battle of Sabac lasted from September 22 until September 24, when 342nd German Division came in aid to besieged Germans and broke rebel encirclement. German soldiers retaliated and killed some 1,000 men from Sabac and Macva. Number of soldiers in Macva partisan detachment drop to half on initial troops. Deployment of 342nd German Division marked beginning of big German counter-offensive on liberated territory.
