Hemos conseguido alcanzar una victoria estrategica, pero el enemigo ha sabido encajar el golpe y la ofensiva no va a tener los efectos planeados... ahora se espera un fuerte contraataque enemigo. Prepare las trincheras.

We have achieved a minor victory, however the enemy has stopped our advance here and in several other sectors. The planned offensive won't accomplish all of its main goals, and many enemy formations are still operational. Intelligence has warned of a counterattack in your sector soon. I advise you to order your troops to dig in.

Commandante, you must hold your lines if the Republic is to survive.
