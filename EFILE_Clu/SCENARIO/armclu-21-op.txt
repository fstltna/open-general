The Halbe Pocket

04/28/1945

Reconnaissance suggested that the best point to breakout was at Halbe, roughly on the Soviet inter-front boundary, where coordination would be the least effective. The escape route ran some sixty kilometers through a wide belt of woodland which would serve to hamper the effectiveness of the Soviet tanks and aircraft. Unfortunately the weather was very dry and parts of the forest had caught fire. Tens of thousands of refugees opted to also try to break out with the troops.

This scenario reflects the last breakout attempt. You only have to take the enemy victory hexes.
15 deploy hexes. New units have strength 5. German units are short on ammo and fuel.
