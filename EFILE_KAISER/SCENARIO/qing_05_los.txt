The Japanese divisions that had invaded Korea moved incredibly quickly, taking the Chinese by surprise. The panic spread, and many Qing units fled the battlefield leaving their equipment to their enemies.

To make things even worse, our spies warned us of an imminent landing of the Japanese Second Army at Pitsewo, in Manchuria, inside the Empire and behind our own lines. So we had to go on forced marches towards the Chinese port of Liushun before the Japanese could take it. If our enemies succeeded, they could even threaten Peking.
