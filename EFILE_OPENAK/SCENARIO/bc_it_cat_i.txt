CATANIA
July 12th, 1943

Our landings on the island have been successful so far, although the American sector had to fight off a fierce counter-attack by a German Panzer Division.  In our sector we have quickly taken the port of Syracuse and we have also taken Augusta.  We can therefore begin our advance to Messina, and you will be at the very head of our column.  For a rapid advance to Messina we need to secure the important Primasole bridge south of Catania, and the port of Catania itself.
