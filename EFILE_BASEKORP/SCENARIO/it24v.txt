ALEXANDRIA November 1942 V

With the last strength left in XX Corps, you were able to capture Alexandria. A similar scenario unfolded itself South of here with DAK standing at the captured Cairo Pyramids with no more than a dozen runners and a few 100 PzGrenadiere.

What our troops need now is a short break to bring more men and material forward for the final dash to the Suez Canal.

News:
- Submarine launched aircraft of our Japanese allies have bombed Oregon (US) forests with incindiary bombs.
- German troops are in the center of Stalingrad but seem to fail to capture the last parts of the city.

Credits: This scenario was created by Adler.
