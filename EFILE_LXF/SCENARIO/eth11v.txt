VICTORY

It was Bishop Abba Petros who rallied the Ethiopians and led them in person towards the city centre, joking with the high-spirited cadets, telling them to die and being told that they wanted to live and fight first.

Aberra Kassa sent men to bring him back to safety, but Abba Petros said that he in any case had come to die. Carrying his cross, wearing his bishop's robes, he marched straight forward into St. George's Square in front of the Cathedral where the Italians were massed, followed with understandable hesitancy by a group of young men.
