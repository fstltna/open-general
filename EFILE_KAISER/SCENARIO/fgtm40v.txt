Gospodin General,

Russia's first amphibious operation in this war has been a stunning success due to your leadership!  You have skillfully combined the fleet's firepower with that of your troops on the ground.  This action has kept a significant portion of Turkish reserves fixed at the sea coast, assisting our plans for an offensive at Erzerum in full.

Note: no amphibious operations will occur during the remainder of the campaign, so you may consider upgrading any Morskaya Pekhota units to other infantry available.
