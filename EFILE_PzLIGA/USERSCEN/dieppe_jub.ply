Dieppe

It is 1942 and the Western Allies are not yet strong enough to mount a large scale invasion of the French coast. After a series of minor raids they put Operation Jubilee - the raid on the French harbour of Dieppe - into effect. The German task is to make sure the raid fails.
ATTENTION: Either side must conquer / hold ALL victory hexes!
