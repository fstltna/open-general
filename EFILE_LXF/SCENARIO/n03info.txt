PUSAN PERIMETER 1 (5 August 1950)

Comrade General, the end of our campaign for liberation is in sight.  We have driven away the capitalist forces of the South and United Nations down into a corner on our Korean peninsula.  The enemy is getting reinforced and the Southern army has regained strength.  Our army has been advancing for over a month and is getting exhausted but our hatred against the capitalist oppressors is driving us forward!

You have been put in command of the entire operation and will command our best comrades.  We will not give the enemy a chance to concentrate its forces by attacking almost across the entire front.  We will destroy them or drive them into the sea!
