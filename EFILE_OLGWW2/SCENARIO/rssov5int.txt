Russo - Manshu Border

August, 1945

Doshita no?, nani?... excuse me General, we are in an unexpected situation now!, the Soviets are launching a full scale offensive against Manchukuo. Some border units together with Manchukoan army units are already trying to stop the bolshevik onslaught!. Although the Kwantung Army is strong enough... could you help us with your troops?, you can drive them quickly to the Xingkai lake to help the Kwantung and Manchukoan units...

[Defensive Scenario info]. The High Command thinks you must hold 5 VHs to get a Brilliant Victory, 3 VHs to get a single Victory, and 2 VH to get a Tactical Victory.
