Llewen's Open AK SSI Blitzkrieg WH v. 3.03

This campaign should be played with Open General 0.90.52.19 or newer, and version 0.317, or newer, of the Open AK efile.  This campaign will not work with any efile other than the Open AK efile by Mikael Anteskog Adler.

The primary testing of the campaign was done at a difficulty of 100/100 using Weak Hand rules for PG2.  This is why the letters "WH" have been added to the name of the campaign.  If this interests you a copy of the rules can be found in the:

[root Open General folder]\EFILE_OPENAK\README\openak_ssi_blitzkrieg_wh_rules.txt.

This campaign is intended to use Open General a.i. version 3.x, as of this date, Jan 26, 2020, the version of the a.i. that this campaign has been tested is only available in the OGX executable, which you will have to ask Luis Guzman for access to.


SUMMARY OF CHANGES FROM SSI BLITZKRIEG FOR PANZER GENERAL II

- High cost efile:  Common and weaker units are less costly, the more expensive units are much more expensive.  This will force you to make a lot of choices, simply buying multiples of all the best equipment will not be an option.

- Much greater variety in the units available both to you as a player and to your computer opponent.

- Higher prestige caps mean that changing the level of difficulty actually will make a significant difference in how the game plays.

- Vastly improved a.i.  Your computer opponent is less predictable, smarter and more aggressive than it was in the original Panzer General II.

- Mission based air combat system:  Your air units fly out, perform their mission, and return to base before the start of your next turn.

- The number of scenarios which have the possibility of offering prototype units has been drastically reduced, while an additional core unit has been added to the opening scenario, as well as a prototype unit to a scenario in the campaign as a capture hex reward, depending on the path the campaign takes.

- Parachute units cannot operate in bad weather.

- Attachments allow you to further specialize units - at a cost, both in terms of prestige and tactically.  Attachments count toward army cost.

- Rain and snow can change ground condition:  As was the case in Panzer General I, rain can make the battle ground muddy, which presents it's own set of challenges.

- Bridge access is restricted to one hex facing per side.

- With the exception of channels leading into ports all ocean hexes within two hexes of land have been changed to shallow sea and capital ships cannot access shallow sea tiles.

- Ground units can only be resupplied or reinforced adjacent to city hexes or depot units.

- The campaign uses green replacements rules.  When you reinforce a unit you can choose green replacements or experienced replacements.  Green replacements cost 80% of the normal unit strength point cost, but will reduce the overall experience of the unit.  Experienced replacements will cost 160% of normal unit strength point cost.

- Units lose 10% of their experience when upgrading.

- Units will not auto refit between scenarios.  Replacements must be purchased, they can be green or experienced.

- Units now have an experience cap of 500.

- Critical hits can sink naval units.

- Naval units cannot block bridges.

- Heavy artillery, strategic bombers and engineer units can "blow" certain hexes.  Engineer units can repair them.

- Engineer units can build temporary bridges and airfields.

- Multiple attackers decrease evade chance.

- Air defence and flak units can only intercept or defend once per turn, unless they are flak with a leader.  Air defence and flak units will intercept any unit that ends it's turn adjacent to them.

- Unit experience gained in combat will decrease by 15% per bar.

- Prototype units cannot be sold.

- Can upgrade and overstrength on supply hexes during scenarios.


INTRODUCTION:

The first person I have worked on this campaign for is myself.  I have always loved realism and challenging game play, and that is what this campaign is intended to offer.  I was initially going to just make this the next version of the original OpenAK SSI Blitzkrieg Campaign, but after some play testing I realized that perhaps some people that enjoyed the previous versions would not enjoy this version because the new options radically change the way the campaign is played.  The new options are intended to make the campaign much more challenging, and to require much more planning and forethought, both tactically and strategically.


STRATEGIC NOTES:

Both this campaign and the original OpenAK SSI Blitzkrieg share the same media files and mission briefings.  Make sure to read the introductions to each scenario carefully the first time you play through the campaign.  There are a few important notes in those written introductions which are not a part of the original SSI mission briefings.  If you are using the original media those notes will not be in the audio.

One of my goals with this campaign has been to make prestige management more meaningful.  I don't know how meaningful prestige management was in the original SSI Blitzkrieg campaign, but I know in earlier versions of this campaign, it wasn't, in large part because I didn't really understand how prestige caps and prestige rewards functioned and interacted with each other.  You will want to capture as many secondary objectives as possible, and pay attention to how much prestige you spend on reinforcements.

This campaign has been modified to use the People's General air mission system, with the exception of the wild weasel missions.  Wild weasel missions weren't used until the 1960's.  There are two kinds of Open AK efile air units intended for recon purposes, one type has recon movement, the other has 4 spotting and can use the recon mission.  If you mouse over your air units you will be given a menu of options.  You can move and attack normally, but when you attack you will not be able to move further and at the end of your opponent's turn your air units will return to their air fields.

On recon missions your air units will fly out and immediately return to base.  Air units on recon missions are subject to out of the sun encounters if they do not have leaders, they are also subject to air defence interception on or adjacent to the target hex of the recon mission, but not while in transit to the target hex.

Defending air units no longer return to base at the start of scenarios.  You will find defending air units providing air cover over significant targets at the start of scenarios throughout the campaign.

Several of the attachment maluses have been replaced with a -2 ammo malus.  If you wish to compensate for this you will need to use the support attachment which will replace the -2 ammo malus with a -1 movement malus.  Aren't choices wonderful?

Be sure to take advantage of the base unit experience in both the Windsor 1941 and Thermopylae, as well as the late campaign scenarios, to replace non-core units with little or no experience.

During Operation Barbarossa and the subsequent scenarios against Soviet forces the Germans do not have air transport capable of transporting the Luftlande-infanterie unit.  If you happen to have any Fallschirm units in your core forces, they can be transported, as can the 40 Brandenburger unit.

In the Salerno and Caen scenarios there are off shore Allied air bases located on ocean hexes.  These are intended to represent air bases on Sicily and the British Isles respectively.  Attacking these air bases will mean certain death.  They are covered with three or four elite heavy air artillery units each, all entrenched to level 10 and overstrengthed to level 15.

The scenarios have been designed to work as standalone scenarios as well.  Playing them as standalone scenarios against the computer should give you a good idea of what is possible and useful in campaign game play in terms of force composition.  Obviously I am not trying to tell you how to develope your campaign core forces, but if you get stuck, the standalone scenarios might give you some helpful hints.

One thing you will notice with the OpenAK SSI Blitzkrieg WH campaign is that you will have a lot more prestige to play with.  The value of your free core units does not count toward your prestige cap, but repairs on them are not free, so any damage to your core units will cost you prestige during the refit phase.  Non-free core units count toward your prestige cap at their current strength, but repairs on them cost 150% of the normal strength point cost for experienced replacements.  It will be important to come out of each scenario with all of your core units as close to full strength as possible.

Air defence and flak units will only intercept or defend once in a turn, unless they are flak units with the leader special that allows multiple interceptions.

The campaign was tested by myself in the context of not losing any core units.  In other words, if I lost a core unit, I restarted the campaign.  Also you will gain no turn prestige during a scenario beyond one turn prior to a brilliant victory.  This should mean that tactical victories and losses that do not end the campaig will present a significant challenge, especially if core units are heavily damaged.  You might consider a campaign successfully completed in spite of core unit losses, and scenario losses and tactical victories to be a badge of honour as there is a very good chance that completing such a campaign will present a much higher level of challenge than a campaign completed with no losses or tactical victories.

A NOTE REGARDING HISTORICAL ACCURACY:

A great deal of historical research and effort went into the original SSI Blitzkrieg campaign, and just as much, if not more, has gone into the OpenAK efile.  As for my conversion efforts, I am a poor student, and a bad researcher.  My main resource is the internet.  I have made some effort to implement some historical features into battles, but for the most part my main concern has been playability.

The original SSI Blitzkrieg and this conversion, are both fantasies.  Certain WWII German generals gained a lot of admiration for their military genius, and some even eventually took a stand against Adolf Hitler, and some of them payed for that stand with their lives.  But in the final analysis the Third Reich was one of the great evils of human history.  This campaign is in no way an endorsement of Nazi Germany, or of the horrible atrocities that were committed in it's name.

This is a strategic game based on WWII battles which were technically some of the most interesting in the history of the human race.  Hopefully games like this will be the only place we will ever be able to relive the horrors those battles represented.
