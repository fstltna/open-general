Marasesti
Aug 6, 1917

Gospodin General,

Romania, having declared her alliance with the Entente in the fall of 1916, had faced a devastating German offensive in Transylvania.  The Romanian armies had retreated across the Sereth River and formed the Romanian Front, our South-Western Front's southern neighbor.  The Romanian Front has been strengthened with our 4th Army and occupied the front along the Sereth River prior to the Kerensky Offensive.  In mid-July the Romanian Front also went on the offensive and moved the front line to the Putna River.  In the end, the Romanian offensive also stalled, and the line stabilized.

The Germano-Austrian counter-attack has devastated our 4th Army in viscinity of the town of Marasesti, and the Romanian 1st Army has taken positions behind our 4th to aid in their withdrawal.  You orders are to hold the front lines with our Romanian allies for as long as the Front command requires.  You will be given specific orders to withdraw.  Failure here will award the Germans a chance to envelop the southern wing of our South-Western Front.
