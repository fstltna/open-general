Operation Solstice

February 15, 1945 

Planned as a double pincer movement by Guderian to cut off the Soviet troops in the Kuestrin area, the offensive was reduced to a single blow from the Stargard sector by Hitler's order. 
The operation was entrusted to Steiner's 11th Panzer Army which had to relieve the Arnswalde garrison and then had to strike further south to crush the Soviet formations there. 
Zhukov was aware of a German attack, but the timing and objectives of such an offensive remained in doubt. Panzergrenadier Division 'Nordland' achieved total tactical surprise on February 15 when it thrust across the wet and heavy terrain as far as to the besieged city of Arnswalde.
The general attack by all German forces opened on February 16 and won some ground in the face of counterattacks and strong anti-tank defences.
The culminating point of Unternehmen Sonnenwende was reached on February 17/18 when the Germans sustained heavy losses from the Soviet anti-tank guns and mines. 
Soon the Soviet counterattack began and the operation was halted.
From the Soviet point of view Sonnenwende could not have struck at a more awkward time or place. The Soviets were forced to halt their own offensives to clear their flanks, what helped to postpone the fall of the Reich for some weeks.
