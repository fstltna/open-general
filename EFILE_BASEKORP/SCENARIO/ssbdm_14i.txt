    "Bucheford,that's a Relief for Pari"  
  The SS was ready to move on Paris.Bad weather through most of December had prevented the Air Korps of the SS/BdM from stopping the 3 French Armee's getting deployed.SS artillery had gotten close enough to do random shelling but it was more a nusiance than anything.The French could not let Paris fall so the fight here would be a 'Stand or Die'.Weather reports from 'Bucheford still had the Sky cloaked in clouds and freezing rain were now too optimistic.Commander Simone Hirkjohns in Paris had just got reports on the Weather plus the Brits getting some armor on the Coast near Dieppe giving Him a few more days respite.Stepping out of His Command Bunker He drove off to the Front of 12th Armee.Through Field Glasses He saw the SS on the move and knew this would be a murderous battle for both sides.Unfortunately for Hirkjohns He noticed the Sky getting lighter,a warmer breeze blowing and the Sun even trying to peek through the Heavy Clouds.And a message from the Brits,what should they do.The French Commander knew this SS/BdM Air Korps would have every plane they had involved in this fight including some new prototype.A 'Relief' Pari would not get, nor Hirkjohns,nor His 3 Armee Groups.Maybe the Brits could move on the SS flank?
