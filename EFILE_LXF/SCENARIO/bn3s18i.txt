General, your objective is the city of Changteh.  This will stop any re-deployment of enemy forces to Yunnan and India.  It will also crush any of the Chinese's counteroffensive operations.  A Raiding-Group will air drop in back of the enemy around Taoyang to cut supply lines and confuse the enemy.  You must reach our airborne troops before the Chinese adapt to the new situation!  Enemy counterattacks are expected from north and west directions!

ORDER - Capture & protect all VHs!
AUXIN - 1 Airborne- & 1 Infantry-Brigade
