Incredible! You managed to stop the Serbian Army and their Montenegrin allies! It's a real pity that Romania and the Ottoman Empire entered the war so soon, because we might have actually defeated Serbia and Greece if they hadn't received aditional help.
Now we'll send reinforcements to our 2nd Army, and we'll deal with the Greeks. Very soon, all of the countries involved in this war will want a peace. 
However, despite your success in battle, I'm afraid that they'll be very hard on us. Vardar Macedonia will remain in Serbia, and we'll lose Agean Macedonia to Greece, Eastern Thrace to the Ottoman Empire, and Dobrudzha to Romania. 
But at least our country will survive, and we'll learn from our mistakes. When the next war starts, we'll be prepared. We'll find allies that will help us. Next time, we won't be alone. Some German officials claim that their country is willing to help...
