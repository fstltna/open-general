As you know, our troops have been having a hard time at Anzio. What was intended to break open our offensive to Rome has turned into a desperate battle for our very lives. Your troops are our only hope to turn the tide. You will reinforce the Allied units at Anzio and with some luck, maybe change the course of the battle in our favor.
