Medenine:

June 3rd, 1943

After the Western front destruction, you are facing your most difficult duty:- in battle once more against Monty's 8th Army. This is a very difficult mission, but if you are successful you will have stopped the threat of our expulsion from Africa.

Note: This was the last operation commanded by Rommel in the African arena.
