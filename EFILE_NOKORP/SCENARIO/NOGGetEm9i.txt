Now playing: Tanks against Bonus Bunkers!
Yes, there are no less than 20 of them this time, and they will be your main opponent.
(Of course not all of them will give you prestige, only some will, others won't, and there is no way to tell which ones do.)

You'll need to fight your way through this thicket of Bonus Bunkers to get to the Victory Hexes and win this round, and they protect each other.
One thing you need to know is that in 19 turns, a huge force of very dangerous modern tanks will appear, on your side of the mountain pass, about where the sand pits are. And they will be accompanied by lots of planes. By then you should better be about to capture the last Victory Hex, because if not you'll lose a lot of units.

To make the fight less dreary, you get a big bad siege mortar like they used to make them in WWI. That should help you with blasting a way through the Bonus Bunkers thicket before all hell breaks lose.
