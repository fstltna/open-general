Defense of Kishinev
The Germans and their allies, the Rumanians, attacking Bessarabia. Stop the advance of the axis troops.
Your troops:
You have only your core troops. We cannot provide more troops, because they are all needed on other frontlines.
Enemy troops:
You are facing the 11. German army in the north. Some parts of the Rumanian third and fourth army are attacking from southwest. The Rumanians are inexperienced. It could be a good idea, that you use your inexperienced troops against them.
Sgn. Major Heinz
