The battle of Jarama - February 25th, 1937 - L

I am aware that conditions have been harsh, but you have done poorly!  The only positive result is that you and your troops have gained some experience in this new type of armored warfare.   But, the new Spanish government and our other allies have not yet learned to respect our military capabilities which we require!   Herr Oberstleutnant, do not disappoint us again.

HISTORIC EVENTS
Elite Spanish Legionnaires and Moroccan Regulares from the Army of Africa forced back the Republican Army of the Centre, including the International Brigades, but after days of fierce fighting no breakthrough was achieved. Republican counterattacks along the captured ground likewise failed, resulting in heavy casualties to both sides.
