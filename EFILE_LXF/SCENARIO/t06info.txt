Our supplylines to all of our fronts are being heavily bombed by British bombers based on the large island of Cyprus. Our fighters cannot save us from that. That means that while preparations are being made for the advance into Egypt, our forces will invade the island of Cyprus! The Germans and Italians will conduct a landing on the westcoast; we will invade from the north-east which is populated by the people of Turkey. Invasion has started earlier this day and has met heavy resistance at the landingbeaches. The German-Italian landing has been more succesfull, because of less resistance. Your troops are embarked at Beirut together with a small flotilla of our Navy to guard your landing. You are ordered to get your men on to the beaches and move inland and win the race to Nicosia: we want to be there first, sooner than the Germans and Italians! The Turks on the island are ready to help you when you are invading, but do not expect miracles of them: they are counting on you! Good luck, General.
