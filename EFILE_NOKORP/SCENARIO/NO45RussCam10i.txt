All right, we've found another fuel depot. The Soviets need fuel too, so you will destroy it. This time it's fortunately in the middle of nowhere, at some railway junction in the boonies, south-east of your position.
Our Intelligence says that region is lightly defended, but they have been wrong before, so beware. Your worst enemy will be the weather anyway, the dreaded Russian winter is upon us and you will most likely lose more soldiers to frostbite than shrapnel.

It's not all bad news though, High Command has allocated more troops to your brigade: We can't support the whole army anymore so we're dismantling the useless 2nd line brigades to reinforce the front line troops like yourself.
Obviously bringing those troops to you is almost impossible due to the deep snow and the lack of fuel. Planes are the only things which are still able to move freely in this godforsaken weather, so expect at least some planes, soon-ish.



Instructions: Destroy the MSUs in the south-east.
Don't forget to plunder as much Prestige as you can afford to.
