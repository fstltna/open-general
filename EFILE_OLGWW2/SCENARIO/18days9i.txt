v.1.0
The Campaign of the 18 Days
(10-28 May 1940)

General,

The German army has launched a general offensive against our lines. Their main effort seems to be on the Leie/Lys river but our positions at the "Canal Dérivation de la Lys" are also being attacked simultaneously on several places.

The German 56th Infantry Division has crossed the Canal de Dérivation defended by the 4 "Division d'Infaterie" and has established a bridgehead around the village of Meigem. 

The "1re Division de Chassesurs Ardennaises" has already been sent to the town of Vinkt to reinforce the front.

Send some additional reinforcements to help the 4 "Division d'Infaterie" to repel the Germans and send them back to the other side of the Canal.

Warning: only four units can be deployed and there is no airfiled available (in case you still have some airforce left).

In addition, supply has become extremely difficult due to the supremacy of the German Luftwaffe.

Victory conditions: take all VH by turn 8 for a BV, turn 9 for a V and turn 10 for a TV.
