HQ 1st Parachute Army, Russia
General Kurt Student

General, the war of attrition in the east must come to an end! At present an offensive is being prepared, which will smash the fighting spirit of the Russians. The operation will be accomplished in two phases.

Phase I: Your parachute corps will be dropped in the Ural Mountains close to the city Ufa. For this operation the newly constituted 22nd Armoured-Air-Landing-Division and several Me323-transporter squadrons will be under your command. Your target is the city Ufa and the destruction of the important war factories in the region.

Phase II: Your troops will go over to defence for the purpose of holding the advancing Russian forces. Your goal is to block the Trans-Siberian railway line between Ufa and Iglino. This will help to cut the supply line between the industrial areas behind the Urals and the Soviet Front. At the same time Army Group Centre will start an offensive on Kazan-Ufa. You will be fight alone for some weeks! Good Luck, General!
