The execution of the plan was perfect. When they learnt that we controlled the Tugela Valley, panic spread among Buller's forces. He tried to react and to retreat in order, but half of his men didn't care to listen to his orders and just ran for they lives. They became an easy prey for Botha and De Wet.

Among the ones who tried to resist some died in battle, others were taken prisoners, and only a handful of them escaped to Zululand. Buller was with them, but right now this isn't a problem. Now we must exploit this victory and take Durban.
