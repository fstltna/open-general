Rawa-Ruska
(September 2, 1914)

The Russian 3rd Army exploited the gap between the KuK 3rd and 4th Armies. You are almost completely encircled; however, you are required to hold on and secure the railway lines until the majority of our troops can escape.

ORDER: Keep your MSU alive and hold at least 3 VHs.
