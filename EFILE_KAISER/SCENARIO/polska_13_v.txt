Amazing! This counterattack will be remembered as one of the finest military feats in Poland's history! The Red Army has been crushed and now its surviving units are fleeing to avoid being surrounded and destroyed by our troops!

We must take advantage of this situation, General! It is most important to advance quickly to the east and recover our lost territories before the Russians have time to recover or the League of Nations forces us to sign an armistice... 

Warning: For the sake of historical accuracy, motorized units should not be deployed in the next scenario!
