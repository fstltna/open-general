Villa and many of his men have escaped. Never mind. I don't know if we'll ever be so close to get him again, but at the very least we'll force him to run and hide. Carranza will consolidate his power knowing that Villa won't be an important threat anymore.

I think that we could have a bigger fish to catch pretty soon. If Wilson is re-elected this year and the Germans keep on acting as irrational barbarians, America will enter the Great War. The British and the French are praying for the day when we'll fight among them, that's for sure, and I believe that day is near. You'd better get ready, for your next destination could be the trenches of France.
