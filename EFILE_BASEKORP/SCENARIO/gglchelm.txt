Once again your XIX Corps let us down Herr General, thankfully the 10th Armie's IV Corps was able to take Chelm and finish this campaign.
The Poles are routed and a demarkation line has been established between Germany and Russia. Take time now to repair and refit your division which I'm sure is battered after your astounding drive across Poland.

At 5pm on the 18th of september the supply column of the 3rd Panzer Division arrived to refuel the vehicles and they set off towards Chelm. They advanced slowly due to bad and blocked roads and destroyed bridges. Only isolated pockets of resistance are ecountered but the division suffers it's highest losses of the campaign so far this day. The lead units enter the outskirts of Chelm and OKW reports suggest a meeting between Heers Groups Nord and Sud here, but this was never substantiated.
von Schweppenburg decides to assemble his wide spread division at Wlodawa where eventually they are relieved before shipping back to Germany.
