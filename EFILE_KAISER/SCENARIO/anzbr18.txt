Brief to Anzac Commander.

The Germans have launched a surprise followup to their failed attack on Villiers-Bretonneaux and have taken the village. You must withstand this onslaught and retake the village!!! (There is only 2 possible outcomes:- Brilliant Victory for holding your 4 Vic Hexs OR Loss for not holding them).
