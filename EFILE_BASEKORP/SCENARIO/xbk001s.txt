Battle for Ebro


The situation is extremely dangerous, we have stopped our offensive over Valencia because the red forces have succesfully crossed the big curve of the river Ebro near to Gandesa (Tarragona). This is a strong attack, the best enemy troops are carrying out this assault; our 50 Division is completely defeat and now it's resisting desperately agaisnt the Republican assaults to Gandesa and Villalva de los Arcos. 

We are sending reinforcements from other less important fronts... the first reinforcements which will arrive are your elite troops, we count on you to stop the Republican offensive. If they get a victory here, the course of the war will turn favorable for the reds, and we cannot allow that!. The Republicans must cross back over the river!.

Good Luck, this time you'll need it.
