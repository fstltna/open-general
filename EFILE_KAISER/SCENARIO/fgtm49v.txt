The 12th Army has escaped the noose of encirclement by September 5th, leaving behind a trail of abandoned equipment, ammunition, and misery.  The Latvian division, having participated in the bloody Mitau Operation in January and in the rearguard actions in the direct path of the German army's main group, has been decimated:  of the 30,000 riflemen raised into the initially over-strengthened division, a third has falled.

The defeated 12th Army is now in no shape to offer resistance to a possible German advance on Petrograd.  The upheavals at the capital (Petrograd experienced riots in June and August and the Bolshevik revolution in October) have precipitated to all units on the front, transforming the army into a disillusioned, hungry, and vengeful mass.  The Bolsheviks will arrange a separate peace with Germany at Brest-Litovsk, ceding massive territory to the enemy.

This war may yet see an end in the West, but it has brewed a new war in the East.  May God be with you, Gospodin General.
