Kappel was an extremely competent officer, and after six weeks of fighting we had defeated all the communist forces between Simbirsk and Khvalynsk. Besides, in the east the Czech Legion had conquered all the important outposts along the Trans-Siberian Railway, from Samara to Irkutsk. Sadly, they didn't reach Ekaterinburg in time to save the Tsar and his family, who were cruelly murdered by the Bolsheviks a few days before the Czechs could control the area.

After these initial victories, from its headquartes in Samara the Komuch decided that our next step should be to capture Saratov, in the south. If Saratov and Tsaritsyn fell in our hands, we'd have a chance to link with the Don cossacks and the Volunteer Army, who were fighting the Bolsheviks in Southern Russia. However, Kappel believed that Kazan, in the north, was a more important target, where we could get decent equipment, ammunition, and new volunteers.

In the end, Kappel convinced the Komuch, and during the summer we headed to Kazan.
