Narotch, Sept 26, 1915

Gospodin General-Leitenant, having penetrated deep into our territory the enemy can finally be stopped.  After capturing Wilna, the German VI (Brecht) and III (von Frommel) Cavalry Corps launched into the widening gap between the 10th (Radkevich) and 5th (Pleve) Armies.  However, with the length of our front shortening, the 2nd Army (Smirnov) maneuvered behind the 10th to counter the German advance east of Lake Narotch.  In an effort to coordinate the efforts of cavalry from both 5th and 10th Armies, a single cavalry army was formed during the battle under General Kozakov, which included the I and Svodny Cavalry corps, several cavalry divisions, and the elite Guard Cavalry division.

You must neutralize all German cavalry rear-guards and drive toward Lake Narotch.  German engineers have begun building a trench system to hold onto their gains.  You must capture these trenches in an effort to enable a counter-stroke against the German 10th Army.  Time is of essense here:  as the front solidifies along lines of entrenchment, our chances of a rapid counter-attack diminish.
