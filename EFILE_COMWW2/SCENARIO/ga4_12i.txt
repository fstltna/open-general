STAVKA agrees with you Comrade Marshal; the drive to capture Mogilev will be critical to the overall success of the Bagration operation. The German forces holding the Mogilev sector have a high proportion of very good units which cannot be allowed to reinforce either of the sectors to the north or south. Your's and general Zakarov's primary objectives are: capture Mogilev, thus taking control of the network of roads running from Mogilev to Minsk, and also to pin down the bulk of the German 4th Armee while the parallel offensives are taking place around Vitebsk and Bobruisk...
