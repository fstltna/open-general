La Bataille de L'Ourcq - Monthyon - September 5th 1914

Von Kluck has sent the bulk of the First Armee SE in pursuit of the French Fifth Armee and the BEF - ignoring the city of Paris and the new French Sixth Armee defending it.  Our 4th Kavallerie Division and the IV Reserve Korps are now the sole units covering the flank of the offensive into France.

General Gallieni - gouverneur militaire de Paris - recognizes the unique opportunity to seriously disrupt our advance and moves General Manoury's complete Sixth Armee out of Paris to strike our flank. The North of the French counterattack does not meet any resistance, but your scouts have spotted the advance units of General Lamaze's V Group de Divisions de Reserve which is about to clash with IV Reserve Korps. The battle of the Marne is about to start here along the river l'Ourq at Monthyon.
