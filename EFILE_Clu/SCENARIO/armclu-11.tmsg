Note: It might be a good idea to replay this scenario and purchase a bridging unit or a bridge (in case you haven't already done).

Note: The Soviets have deployed a Guards Anti Aircraft Artillery Division near to their bridges!
The Soviets have now established some front near airfileds!

Now a withdrawal is possible!
