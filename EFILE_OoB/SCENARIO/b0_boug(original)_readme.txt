1. CREDITS and CONTACT INFORMATION:

1a. Credits:
Bill Dickens has created the equipement file. It is a very balanced efile and has many, many units for every country. It might be the best equipement file concerning the Pacific theatre. Steve Brown and Moredecai playtested the campaign and gave me valuable comments. Steve Brown let me uses this readme template for my campaign as well. Thank you ALL!

1b. Contact information:

2. SIMPLE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

For players familiar with PG2 - here is all you need to know:

Equipment file – The one included in the download. You can only use this one.
Maps -   Buin (296), Buka (293), Torokina (297).
PG2 Version to use - at least 2.10

3. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

This readme assumes some basic knowledge of copying, moving and unzipping files in Windows and you should at least know which folder on your computer contains the program. User-made additions to Panzer General 2 are not as easy to install as the original software, but are not difficult if you read the installation instructions and use a certain amount of common sense - new maps, equipment files and other material ALL have installation instructions (some of which are included with the downloads and some of which are on the web sites). It is important to remember that while I am very happy to help with any problems - all the information you need is available, you only need to take the time to find and read it. The “Upgrade Center” on Steve Brown’s web site has the basics of upgrading - http://www.wargamer.com/pg2campaigns/steve/upgrade/pg2-uc.htm

3a. Download the campaign:
Download the campaign (yes, you most likely have done this already). This archive contains:
i. CAMPAIGN.ZIP - The US/UK version of the campaign,
ii. README.ZIP - Campaign documentation,
iii. EQUIPMENT.ZIP – Special equipement file

3b. Unzip:
Unzip files from CAMPAIGN.ZIP to your SCENARIO folder. Unzip files from EQUIPMENT.ZIP to your main program folder (usually PANZER2)

3c. Equipment file:
The, in this download included, special equipement file must be used. You need the equipment files, the “soundup2005 for new sounds ” (which you can download from Steve Brown’s site or Adlerkorps.com), icons and other graphics upgrades from Steve Brown’s site or Adlerkorps.com and the “datup” (for the graphics and icons) - if you have not installed equipment files or graphics updates before just download everything and follow the instructions, or contact me if you have questions. The “Upgrade Center” on Steve Brown’s web site has the basics of upgrading - http://www.wargamer.com/pg2campaigns/steve/upgrade/pg2-uc.htm.

3d. Maps, download:
You need the maps Buin (296), Buka (293), Torokina (297).

Get the maps from the Panzergeneral2.com (http://panzergeneral2.com/cgi-bin/maps/map.pl?fn=agheila) or Steve Brown’s Clearinghouse (http://www.wargamer.com/pg2campaigns/steve/clearinghouse/pg2-mods_n_stuff-maps.htm) or www.stahlhelm.prv.pl.

3e. Maps, install:
If you do not know how to install user maps, follow the instructions EXACTLY from “How to use maps” at the Map Center and you should have no problems - most campaign crash problems are related to incorrect installation of the user maps;

	3f. Video and Music:
This campaign does not use custom video files;

3g. Patches & running French or German versions of PG2:
You MUST first patch your program to v1.02 using the official SSI patch and you MUST also be using the “unofficial” v2.10 or higher patch (the latest version at time of writing is 2.10). Look at the “Versions & Patches” section of Builders Paradise for more information and the “Clearinghouse” on Steve Brown’s site for the unofficial patch. The unofficial patches will only work for US & UK versions of PG2; but will also work with German and French versions if you use the “DEU/FRA to Text Converter“ from the “Downloads” section of Steve Brown’s web site.

3h. List of playable campaigns in PG2
This campaign will be listed as "AUSTRALIAN BOUGAINVILLE CAMPAIGN". Once you have upgraded to the ‘unofficial’ version 2.02 patch, the up and down arrows of the scroll bar now work (but not the scroll bar itself), so scroll down until you see the campaign.

That’s it ... start the campaign and enjoy!

4. REVISION HISTORY:

Version 1.00 released July 2005.

5. THE CAMPAIGN:

In November 1943 American Marines land at Torokina and establish a beachhead. Not until March 1944 the Japanese launch a massive counterattack. The attack is held and center of war moves on closer to Japan. To make American divisions free for tasks elsewhere, Australian forces will take over the American perimeter on Bougainville. But they will not sit down and be idle. The Australians will launch offensives to reduce the Japanese power on Bougainville. The Japanese have four times as much soldiers on the island. Can you liberate Bougainville all the way up to Buka in the north and Buin in the south? Fight battles on company level in a terrible terrain with jungle, mountains and an enemy like the Japanese!

6. CAMPAIGN DEVELOPMENT NOTES, RULES and BUGS:

This campaign was playtested at 100% prestige; very inexperienced players may want to start at 150% or higher, which will gain you some extra prestige.

It was a fun campaign to make and I made all scenarios in less than two days in the summer of 2004. I needed to give it a finishing touch but never got around it until exactly a summer later: 2005. It is really a different type of campaign than most players are used to. All core units will be at strength 6 to represent company level. Furthermore the enemy is usually at strengths 2, 3, 4 and 5. All the battles fought are really minor engagements, sometimes only featuring less than 10 units. 

I hope the campaign is well balanced and playable by everyone. Some scenarios are harder than others. With most scenarios you cannot be dropped out of the campaign but instead you have to replay the scenario and try to win another time.

7. HINTS & TIPS:

Unit purchasing is different in this campaign than most other campaigns. If you want to play without my purchasing advice please ignore this section. In general you should build up a strong infantry force, with most likely one artillery piece and perhaps a tank. More is really not needed, not you will have the prestige to buy it.

Transport:
Transports are not needed at all. They cost valuable prestige and because you are fighting in dense jungle and mountains, transports aren’t up to the task. Even your artillery will not need transport, it can just move it 1 hex movement. It will do.  

Tanks:
Tanks are not needed. They are an easy prey in this terrain. But in the southern path it is useful to have one though not required.

Anti-Tank:
AT units are not useful as you will not face more than 1 or 2 enemy tanks. A machine gun unit is nice but not needed.

Air-Defense:
AD units are not needed as there is sufficient auxiliary aircraft to be found. Plus the enemy usually does not even have aircraft. 

Artillery:
Artillery is important and having one is a must. Usually a 25 pounder works very well. It moves 1 hex, thus does not need transport, and has range 4. One is sufficient.

Recon:
Recons aren’t needed. Usually you won’t be advancing faster than 1 hex a turn. Although a cheap scout is useful.

Infantry:
Infantry is very important. AIF Regulars are usually the way to go, perhaps some Native Troops as well. Having 4-5 is sufficient. Infantry is the most powerful unit in this type of warfare! 

Bombers and Fighters:
You do not need core aircraft since there are usually plenty of auxilary units and in any case. A waste of prestige, but there are times when you can choose to get a bomber instead, of say, a tank.


8. FINAL NOTE:

This campaign is the result of many months’ work by Dennis Felling and I consider it copyrighted. Please do not change anything on a version that you are making available to other players. You absolutely do not have permission to include this campaign with any commercial product without my permission!
