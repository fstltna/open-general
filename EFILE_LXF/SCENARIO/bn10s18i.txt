
TEHERAN - 22 SEP 1941

South of Tehran, Iran

The liberation of Tehran is an operation with foreign policy relevance for Germany - a success would strengthen the young alliance of our nations. And this alliance is important for Germany, because of the oil reserves and the strategic position of Iran. The operation is more or less thoroughly prepared despite the short time. An airborne operation east of Tehran should provide distraction and bind enemy forces, while your troops advance directly to Tehran and finding their way as liberators into the Iranian capital. The General Staff expect nothing more than a success!

GOAL: Take all VH's!
