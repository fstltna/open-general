Closing in on Dunkirk May1940 L
What a pitiful performance Herr General. This is the end of the French campaign for your troops. Luckily other generals performed much better and France will soon be in our hands. I don't understand why, but Hitler is giving you command over the complete SS-V division. The division will be renamed to SS Reich.
