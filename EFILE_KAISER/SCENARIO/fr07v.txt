The First World War - Assault at Artois - 17th, Dec. 1914 V

Général, well done. But your advance hasn't been as deep as we had planned.The Loretto Heights are still in German hands. Now we must gather our troops and reinforce our frontline, before planning new attacks

Because of your experience in colonial warfare, the QG has new plans for you and your men.

HISTORICAL EVENTS:
Both sides suffered heavy losses, and the Germans held the Loretto Heights until the third Battle of Artois in November 1915. Even then, they could stop the French a few kilometres to the East, at the Vimy Ridges, south of Lens.
All in All, the First Battle of Artois was a very bloody engagement, and one first taste of Verdun.
