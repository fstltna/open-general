As you might know, Commander,  the Marines have been planning an amphibious assault on the Tarawa Atoll.  The key Island in this region is the Japanese base at Betio. The Japanese have been fortifying the Island for years and their commander vows that Tarawa cannot be taken by sea.  The Second Marines have been assigned the task of taking Betio.  Unfortunately, the 2nd Marine Armored Brigade has come down with an epidemic of Malaria and has been put out of action. Because of your work at Guadalcanal, the Marines have asked that you be assigned as their armored support group for this mission. Believe me, there will be losses in this mission. The Japanese holding the Island are tough and experienced and well dug-in. You can expect every last one of them to fight to the death.

Objective: You must destroy all enemy units to win this scenario.
