Well, try defending for a change.
It's always easier to defend, especially if you can place your units beforehand, and take advantage of a favorable terrain.

Beware, you will have to ride out a big enemy offensive, with lots of adult-sized tanks, and after a while, another, much bigger one.

You might want to counterattack between those two, unless of course you've harvested all previous Bonus Bunkers and now control a vast army...
Remember, in a little more than a dozen turns all hell breaks lose.
