03. The drive on Tunis - German counterattack on Medjez El Bab - December 6th, 1942

German troops started a major counterattack. They are in front of the Tebourba gap and are attacking Combat Command B troops on the East bank of the river Medjerda. Stop the enemy advance so that we are not pushed back into Algeria.

Again French troops will assist your forces, but they will not take orders from you.

ORDERS
Hold 3 or more Victory hexes a the end of turn 10 for BV, 2 for V and 1 for TV. Losing all victory hexes will result in a Loss and the end of the campaign. A Loss ends the campaign.

NOTES: 
- You can deploy all core units in this scenario.
- French units are fighting on your side, but are controlled by the AI, not by you.
- Units will be automatically reinforced to strength 10 at the end of the scenario and you will be able to acquire new units.
