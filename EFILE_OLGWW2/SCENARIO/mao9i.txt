Winter Offensive

1-12-1947 Liaoning Province, NE China.

The KMT troops are badly wounded.  Our victories at Changchun and Siping have decimated their men, commander, and you must put an end to the nationalist resistance in Manchuria.  Your mission is to secure the communications between our base at Siping and our groups in the South, near to Shenyang.  Then you must take Shenyang.  It is the historical Manchurian capital and is both an important industrial and political center.  The capture of Shenyang will open the way to Beijing and Nanjing.

I don't think the snow and the bad weather conditions of the Manchurian Winter will be a major problem for you.
