Wilno offensive

April 18th, 1919

After the Great War, Poland became an independent republic again. But rebuilding of the state was halted by the Soviet attack last winter. Instead of the roads and towns that needed to be built, the army had to be sent in to stop the Bolsheviks. A few weeks ago the Russians crushed Polish positions near Wilno and took the city. Then they occupied other Polish territories. Now it's time to stop the bolsheviks and take Wilno back.

Victory conditions: Liberate Wilno and secure the roads heading north and east from the town. Take all VHs. Keep both marked units alive!

Intelligence report: There are more enemy regiments in the area. There is not only the Western Division, allegedly Polish,  but also a division from Pskow. Wilno is heavilly garrisoned by remnants of the previously beaten enemy that can also be found outside the town. There is a possibility that Polish citizens of Wilno will stand against the Communists. Don't expect further reinforcements.

Good Luck!
