March, 3., 1862 Pea Ridge


Dear Friend,
our order is to secure Arkansas for the Union !

As we have won Missouri for us I think our meanwhile well established cavallery will free Arkansas quickly too...

Seemingly at the moment only weak enemy forces stand there against us, but reconnaissance reports that the Confederates have sent General van Dom with a relieving army....

ORDERS:
TAKE ALL VH's

ADVICE FROM YOUR OLDEST SERGEANT:
Don´t let the two Confederate army groups get into contact with each other !
