In case you didn't notice it on the last map, there are often little surprises hidden in inaccessible or strange places. "Inaccessible"? Well, not for you, you're smarter than that, aren't you.
Let's try again, with a different map.

Beware, there are now 3 of those "Nightmare Tanks" around, and many small weak ones... You might want to build up your (anti-) tank force.
(There are of course also a couple Bonus Bunkers, but you know how these work by now.)

To compensate you get a bunch of free units: A light and fast recoilless gun, a bridging unit you might need with all those rivers, a recon armed with a light AT gun, and another supply unit since I bet your guys can't reload fast enough.
