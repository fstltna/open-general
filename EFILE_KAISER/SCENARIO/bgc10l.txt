Our attempt to capture Hill 60 have failed. Losses have been heavy again. I fear our troops don't have the power nor the morale for another desperate attack. I don't see any positive prospect for this campaign anymore, General.

HISTORICAL OUTCOME:
In the afternoon of August 21, the first assault was made. With no effective artillery support, under fire from Hill 60 and neighbouring Hill 100, the infantry were decimated. The undergrowth caught fire, burning to death many of the wounded. Nevertheless, by nightfall the Indian Brigade had managed a foothold at the base of the hill.
On August 22 the attack was reinforced by the Australian 18th Battalion which was part of the newly arrived Australian 2nd Division. The men were fresh and healthy, in stark contrast to the veteran troops, but were inexperienced and ill-equipped, even by Gallipoli standards. Attacking with bayonet only, they suffered 383 casualties in their first attack.
The attack resumed on August 27 and further progress was made up the slope, but the summit of the hill was still held by the Turks. Now the Australians from the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, who had fought at The Nek, were fed into the battle as reinforcements. On August 28 the Australians captured some of the Turkish trenches at the summit but the Turks clung to the vital northern face which overlooked Suvla. Attacking and counter-attacking continued until August 29 when the Allied offensive finally ceased.
