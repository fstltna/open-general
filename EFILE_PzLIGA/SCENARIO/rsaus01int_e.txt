Australia Invasion - Darwin

November, 1942

Welcome to the Gohoku region.  The big allied base on this country must be removed if we want to secure our Empire.  Although our reports inform us that the area of Darwin is fortified, the surrounding areas are a desert; it seems the Australians have evacuated the population and some facilities to the inner part of the country.  With your troops clear Darwin and establish a beach head to allow further penetrations into Australia.
