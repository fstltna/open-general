Moscow

Dec 12th, 1919

I thought I'd never say this, but I'm almost glad to be back on the battle. I know that it may sound strange coming from a member of the Military Directory that will govern Russia until the revolution is completeley defeated, but I simply can't get used to political affairs. In my opinion, those pointless discussions were mostly responsible for the fall of the Tsar and the coming of the Bolsheviks.

So I actually prefer to be here, where I can serve my country by taking Moscow. The old capital that has been transformed into the Beast's lair. The horrific place where the Red godless demons lurk. Never before have I been so eager to fulfill my duty. This city must be saved from the communists. 

The flanks are secured, thanks to the efforts of May-Mayevsky and Sidorin on my left, and Wrangel and Diterikhs on my right. The enemy's defences are strong. In fact, Moscow resembles a fortress now. But I won' let that stop me. Moscow will be free, even if it costs me my life.

Victory conditions: 
- Take all the VHs.
