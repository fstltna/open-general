Spanish Expedition

Part 1/4 of the "Blitzkrieg" minicampaign


"Si! Yo entiendo, senor coronel! Voy a hacerlo lo mejor posible...

Meine Herren, Oberst Alvarez wants us to listen to his explanations on the current situation, then we'll dissect the battle plan. A minute, please! So, watch this map... Proceder, el coronel!

So, Oberst says that the Reds' strength is vastly depleted, yet so is ours. Hence, both sides can't do much more than hold the nest defenses around the bridges. The situation is unsustainbale and must be solved before the enemy gets reinforces. We'll cross the bridges... hier und... ja, hier! It shouldn't be too hard, because the rebels seriously  lack men and their companies are mostly reduced to strengthened platoons at the very best. Our only concern are those annoying tanks of them. Scouts' reports are uncertain, but at least one three-vehicles platoon was spotted en route, while other machines were uncovered by the air support. Lets assume that the Reds may press six or seven tanks into service.

Hauptmann Bistroff, your task is the most important. You must support the river crossing and make sure that our kameraden get through. Silence any resistance, namely the deadly MGs and once we'll found the enemy tanks, engage and destroy them.

Our airforce should arrive once we've crossed the river and they'll help with reconnaisance and softening of the enemy lines. The airbases are very distant, so our crews won't be able to replenish their load. We must hope that they won't dump their bombs at first flak shots...

Sie haben Fragen? Nein?

Muy bien, senor coronel, podemos discutir los detalles..."


Victory conditions: Capture all VHs.
