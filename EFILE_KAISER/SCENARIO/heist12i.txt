Brigaadikindral, following your brilliant performance on the Southern Estonian Front, you are joining the operations of the Estonian naval and marine forces.  Starting from the battles of Tallinn, our (and our allies') forces have performed naval assault operations.  Here, we hope to combine the speed of your Soomusrong with the skill of our marines to continue the advance along the coast of the Gulf of Finland.

The first phase of the operation will be the landing of a small marine force (4 marine units) on the shore of the gulf.  You must perform this quickly, because there are Soviet ships in the area.  In the viscinity of Korovkino and on the Tallinn-Petrograd railroad, you may deploy a small forward force.  These units must quickly reach Krakol'ye or Kamenka to allow the deployment of the remainder of your troops.
