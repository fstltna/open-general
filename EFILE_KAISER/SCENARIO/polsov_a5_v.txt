You won!

The defence by the Legiony was one of the factors which saved the Austro-Hungarian army from complete disaster. This outstanding accomplishment was so impressive, that on November 5th, 1916 the German and Austrian Emperors granted independence for the Kingdom of Poland. 

According to international law, they could not conscript subjects of the Tsar. Only volunteers could be asked to fight against the Tsar and Russia. And all volunteers have been in Polish Legions already. So to get the Polish coscripts, Emperors had to grant the independence for the Kingdom of Poland. But once the independence was granted, there was no need for the Poles to fight on the side of the Central Powers anymore.
