Prochorovka - July 1943 BV

Herr General, You defeated the Tank Armies that formed the last Russian reserves in this sector. If it wasn't for Hitler, we could drive on to Kursk and accomplish all of our goals. 
After receiving the news of the Allied invasion of Sicily, as well as reports of impeding Soviet attacks on the Mius River and at Izyum, Hitler decided to cancel Operation Zitadelle. Unfortunately, we will not be able to completely finish of the Russian armor with the 3 Panzer divisions we kept in reserve.

Hitler has decided IISS Panzer Corps is needed to deal with the anticipated Soviet diversionary attacks south of the Belgorod-Kharkov sector.
