Llewen's Open AK SSI Blitzkrieg v. 2.16

The most recent version of the Open AK efile can be found at the Open General page:

http://www.open-general.com/install/efiles_r/EFILE_OPENAK.zip

This campaign should be played with Open General 0.90.52.06 or newer, and version 0.317, or newer, of the Open AK efile.  This campaign will not work with any efile other than the Open AK efile by Mikael Anteskog Adler.

The primary testing of the campaign was done at a difficulty of 100/100 using Weak Hand rules for PG2.  If this interests you a list of the rules can be found in the openak_ssi_blitzkrieg_wh_rules.txt file.


SUMMARY OF CHANGES FROM SSI BLITZKRIEG FOR PANZER GENERAL II

- High cost efile:  Common and weaker units are less costly, the more expensive units are much more expensive.  This will force you to make a lot of choices, simply buying multiples of all the best equipment will not be an option.

- Much greater variety in the units available both to you as a player and to your computer opponent.

- Vastly improved a.i.  Your computer opponent is less predictable, smarter and more aggressive than it was in the original Panzer General II.

- Mission based air combat system:  Your air units fly out, perform their mission, and return to base before the start of your next turn.

- Parachute units cannot operate in bad weather.

- Attachments allow you to further specialize units - at a cost, both in terms of prestige and tactically.  Attachments count toward army cost.

- Rain and snow can change ground condition:  As was the case in Panzer General I, rain can make the battle ground muddy, which presents it's own set of challenges.

- Bridge access is restricted to one hex facing per side.

- With the exception of channels leading into ports all ocean hexes within two hexes of land have been changed to shallow sea and capital ships cannot access shallow sea tiles.

- You can upgrade and overstrength units on supply hexes - airfields for air units.

- Critical hits can sink naval units.

- Naval units cannot block bridges.

- Heavy artillery, strategic bombers and engineer units can "blow" certain hexes.  Engineer units can repair them.

- Engineer units can build temporary bridges and airfields.

- Multiple attackers decrease evade chance.


INTRODUCTION:

First a note on difficulty.  Open General, when you play with all the bells and whistles, is a much more challenging game than Panzer General II.  The same can be said for this campaign.  It is, and is intended to be, more challenging, and hopefully more interesting, than the original.  Due to a lack of broad based testing it is a little hard to say exactly where the campaign falls now, but I would say it ranges from moderately to highly challenging, depending on random factors such as the weather in individual scenarios and protoype units gained throughout the campaign.


STRATEGIC NOTES:

Make sure to read the introductions to each scenario the first time you play through the campaign.  There are a few important notes in those written introductions which are not a part of the original SSI mission briefings.  If you are using the original media those notes will not be in the audio.

This campaign has been modified to use the People's General air mission system, with the exception of the wild weasel missions.  Wild weasel mission weren't used until the 1960's.  There are two kinds of Open AK efile air units intended for recon purposes, one type has recon movement, the other has 4 spotting and can use the recon mission.  If you mouse over your air units you will be given a menu of options.  You can move and attack normally, but when you attack you will not be able to move further and at the end of your opponent's turn your air units will return to their air fields.  On recon missions your air units cannot be intercepted by air defence or flak units and they will fly out and immediately return to base.  Air units on recon missions can however still be subject to out of the sun encounters if they do not have leaders.

During Operation Barbarossa and the subsequent scenarios against Soviet forces the Germans do not have air transport capable of transporting the Luftlande-infanterie unit.  If you happen to have any Fallschirm units in your core forces, they can be transported, as can the 40 Brandenburger unit.

In the Salerno and Caen scenarios there are off shore Allied air bases located on ocean hexes.  These are intended to represent air bases on Sicily and the British Isles respectively.  Attacking these air bases will mean certain death.  They are covered with three or four elite heavy air artillery units each, all entrenched to level 10 and overstrengthed to level 15.

All of the scenarios have been designed and tested as standalone scenarios as well.  Playing them as standalone scenarios against the computer should give you a good idea of what is possible and useful in campaign game play in terms of force composition.  Obviously I am not trying to tell you how to develope your campaign core forces, but if you get stuck, the standalone scenarios might give you some helpful hints.


A NOTE REGARDING HISTORICAL ACCURACY:

A great deal of historical research and effort went into the original SSI Blitzkrieg campaign, and just as much, if not more, has gone into the OpenAK efile.  As for my conversion efforts, I am a poor student, and a bad researcher.  My main resource is the internet.  I have made some effort to implement some historical features into battles, but for the most part my main concern has been playability.

The original SSI Blitzkrieg and this conversion, are both fantasies.  Certain WWII German generals gained a lot of admiration for their military genius, and some even eventually took a stand against Adolf Hitler, and some of them payed for that stand with their lives.  But in the final analysis the Third Reich was one of the great evils of human history.  This campaign is in no way an endorsement of Nazi Germany, or of the horrible atrocities that were committed in it's name.

This is a strategic game based on WWII battles which were technically some of the most interesting in the history of the human race.  Hopefully games like this will be the only place we will ever be able to relive the horrors those battles represented.


SPECIAL THANKS

To Von Adler for listening to feedback and making the changes to his efile that were necessary to make this campaign work in it's present form.  Thank you to Luis Guzman for all the work he has put into Open General to make it truly something special, and for listening to feedback and bug reports and making additions and fixing problems which again made this campaign possible.  Thanks as well to Eggman, Ezne, Nexus and REDrake from JP's Panzers Forums for their invaluable help in testing the campaign.
