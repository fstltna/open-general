Under the extreme cold weather, we couldn't accomplish our mission, and Ufa remained under the control of the Bolsheviks. Our troops in the south weren't lucky, either, and before the end of January we lost the town of Orenburg, too. But, at least, the Soviet attacks stopped. Our enemies were exhausted after so many months of combats.

We decided to start a counteroffensive when the spring came, but we knew that it was going to be a difficult task. The Soviets had established solid defence lines at the foot of the Urals, and breaking them wouldn't be easy.
