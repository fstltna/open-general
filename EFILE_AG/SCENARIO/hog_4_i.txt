..... From the south, a new enemy is trying to invade Gaul: Rome.
Some tribes are allied with the Romans, others are fighting them .... Like our old allies in the north, the courageous Eburones, under their battle-experienced chief Ambiorix .....

The Romans under the legate Lucius Aurunculeius Cotta flee headlessly towards their next fortified camp ......

.... just in time our men were able to join the Eburonian forces to attack the wide spreaded out marching lines of the Romans ....
