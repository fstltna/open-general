Oboyan

Aug 12th, 1919

At first I couldn't understand the reasons why Denikin sent me here, to the left flank of our battle front, in order to help May-Mayevsky, who had recently asked for reinforcements, because he knows that I dislike that man. I consider him a competent general, but a disgusting kind of person. Even worse, he's allowed his soldiers to behave almost as common criminals, bandits and looters, not very different from the Bolsheviks that are destroying Russia.
But the point is that Denikin is well aware of May-Mayevsky's behaviour and thinks that things can't go on like that, so he decided to send an officer who would demand the highest standards of discipline. And he chose me.

As part of our general offensive I have to reach Kursk and then march on Moscow. The first step will be to crush the enemy defences at Oboyan. Once I have succeeded the road to Kursk will be open and Moscow will be much closer.

Victory conditions: Take all the VHs.

Intelligence report:
- Some Soviet partisan units have been spotted on your rear guard. Watch out!

Special note:
- At the start of the next scenario auto-refit will be disabled, so be careful with your casualties.
