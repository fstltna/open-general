October 25, 1848

Herr General! Due to your glorious campaign in Lombardy the situation has been stabilized in our southern provinces. However, I have some bad news. The people of Vienna started another revolution against the imperial family on October 6. Moreover, the Hungarian rebels beat Jellachic’s troops on September 29, and his invasion of Hungary has failed. Now the Hungarians are standing on the border, only 40km (25 miles) far from die rebellische Stadt. Fortunately, fresh and loyal troops commanded by graf Windisch-Grätz are at the gates of Vienna and the city is completely encircled. Your task is to attack from the south. Be quick, nobody knows how the Hungarians will act.
