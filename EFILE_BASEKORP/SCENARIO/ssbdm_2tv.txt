The Fuehress was inspecting some new recruits.Some of the girls were from Amerika.As she walked the line She was impressed,fine specimens to change the 'Rule of Order' to the stronger sex.ILse and Her entourage stopped."What is that" She questioned.An Amerikan had a little stars and stripes pin on.The girl gave an explanation but after a few words the Fuehress told her to " Shut-up, there will be no deviations on uniforms of the SS.Make up Your mind 'Frau.You have come to the Frauland to be One of Us,have You not?Either You play our game or the game of those We will conquer.All ties before the SS must be Cut.You are either Our sister in the 'BdM' or Our enemy.Now take that off this instance,disgusting.Frau Klein (Ilse's secretary) take a note I never want to see anything disgracing the uniforms again".The pin was removed.ILse continued the inspection.ILse then inspected the Panzers.A MkIV prototype was shown among the Mark III's."Frau Klien how is the progress going on the IV's"? "Miene Fuehress,We still have some problems to solve pushing the beast that is a lot of weight,the Armor and Gun and the transmissions are really taxed.With the influx of Minds now joining Our ranks they will be solved before the 'Great Conflict' against Stalin".So ILse had Panzers that would dominate the battles on the ground and 'Frau Heyfeld of Junkers Aircraft had assured Her the Birds would be there to control the Skies.
