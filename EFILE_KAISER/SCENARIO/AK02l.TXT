Verdun - June, 1916 - L

Quickly, go back to our trenches. Immediately! Emboldened by their victory, the French will launch a counterattack soon. If they surprise you, you and our entire front will be lost. 

We'll never force the French to surrender if things keep on going like this. The Alpenkorps will need to do it better next time. I'd like to get rid of you, but we can't afford it. We need to use all the men that are available. So go back to the front and keep on fighting until the battle is over. After that, there will be a new mission waiting for you.
