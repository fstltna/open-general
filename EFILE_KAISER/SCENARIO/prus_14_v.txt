The day before the battle of Saint Quentin, Wilhelm I had been formally proclaimed German Emperor in the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles. A new major power had been born in Europe.

At Saint Quentin the French lost their last organized army, and once the battle was over nothing could stop the new German nation from achieving a total victory. Alsace and Lorraine would become German territories, among other harsh peace conditions.
However, knowing that everything was lost, the French Government of National Defence started to negotiate an armistice on 24 January. The negotiations were quick, and President Favre signed the armistice at Versailles three days later. It came into effect at midnight, on 28 January 1871. Gambetta didn't surrender the French provintial armies until February 6th, but that didn't make a difference.

The German ambitions didn't stop there, though. Over the years, Germany developed strong rivalries with France and Russia, and the British Empire started to see the new country as a menace to her world hegemony. Sadly, those tensions would eventually lead to the Weltkrieg of 1914... But that's another story, that has also been told.

The campaign is over. I hope you've liked it, and thanks for playing.
