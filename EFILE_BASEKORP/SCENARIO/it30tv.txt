Your XX Corps has broken through Allied lines. Trieste and Littorio are on route for Beirut and Ariete is moving on Damascus. DAK has taken Amman and is routing Russian forces on its way to Baghdad. Meanwhile X and XXI Corps continue their drive South along the Nile, have taken Khartoum without much resistance and have started the attack on Adis Abeba.

Hitler initially wanted to call off Zitadelle after Prokhorovka, but luckily Von Manstein was able to convince him to commit the last mobile reserves so that the captured ground could be held and 5 Guards Tank Army fully destroyed. 2SS Panzer Armee is exploiting the gap in Russian lines. We all hope that they will meet up with Model's forces that have resumed the attack against the North of the Kursk salient.

You have done a great job leading Mussolini's Afrika Korps in its conquest of the Middle East. Congratulations. This war can still be won!
