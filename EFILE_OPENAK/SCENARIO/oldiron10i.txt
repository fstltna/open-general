10. Winter attack on the Reinhard Line - December8th, 1943

After the successful Allied campaign in Sicily, followed by the British 8th Army crossing the Strait of Messina and the US 5th Army landing in Salerno, the Italians surrendered and the Germans were driven out of muchg of Southern Italy.

The terrain and the season reduce the chances of breaking through the Reinhard line - and the Gustav line behind it - that bars our advance to Rome. But by maintaining pressure, however, we can prevent the Germans from resting and refitting the tired and depleted divisions which they might hold as a mobile reserve for the close defense of Rome in the event of an Allied landing on the west coast or for use in a possible counteroffensive in the opening months of 1944.

Your task is to take as many of the positions of the Reinhard line as possible.


ORDERS
Hold all 5 Victory Hexes at the end of the scenario for Brilliant Victory, 4 for Victory, 3 for Tactical Victory. 2 or less will result in Loss.

Expect some air unit reinforcements if the weather clears. Three units can be deployed close to the front line. The rest at the Supply Hex further behind the front.

NOTES: 
- Units will be automatically reinforced to strength 10 at the end of the scenario and you will be able to acquire new units at that point.
