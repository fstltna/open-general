Herr General, I know that you and your men have not had time even to catch a breath, but the situation here is critical. Buda-Pest is besieged by the Bolsheviks. Your troops must force their way into the outer defences of the city and reinforce them sufficiently to prevent the fall of Buda-Pest. It is doubtful that our Hungarian allies will continue to fight if we lose Buda-Pest to the Russain Bear.

NOTE: You can use the Refit/Overstrength button to bring weak units back up to full strength if desired...
