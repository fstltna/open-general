This hypothetical campaign follows the actions of an hypothetical force: the German Marine Corps. Together with a powerful flotilla of all sorts of warships, this force will join the coastal battles of World War II. Fight at known battles as Westerplatte and Narvik with your ships fighting off the enemy fleets and supporting your invading marines! The campaign ends with an escape to German-occupied Norway for a last stand.
