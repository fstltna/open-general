You took part in the first Spanish Civil War, so you might be able to make sense of this one! Everything here is mixed up. The Spanish army is divided into factions that can't be seperated, some are pro-German and some are idiots who still can't see that we'll win in the end. Just clean the mess up here. If troops fight on your side, treat them well. If they don't, beat them.
