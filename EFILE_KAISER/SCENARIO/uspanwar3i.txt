Teniente Coronel,

Bienvenido a Filipinas!

Since last year a secret organization called Katipunan has started an armed revolt with the goal to get the independence of the Philippines from Spain. Although an attack on Manila in August failed, the revolt has spread to other provinces, especially Cavite province, the main centre of rebellion. In Cavite, our troops, often heavily outnumbered, have been repeatedly defeated and katipuneros, led by Emilio Aguinaldo, have gained control over almost the entire territory of the province.

The reinforcements that have arrived with the new Governor-General Camilo Polavieja have been formed into a division, "Lachambre Division.", named after its commander, Major General José de Lachambre, with the objective of recapturing Cavite and crushing the Katipunan insurrection.

While two brigades are attacking Cavite from the north and east, Lachambre is leading the main force moving from the southeast portion of the province. It seems that the multi-pronged attack will converge on the town of Silang, where the revolutionaries are hunkered down in the impressive trench works built. 

You will join Lachambre Division in his offensive to recapture Cavite.

Victory conditions: to take all VHs by turn 10 for a BV, turn 14 for a V and turn 16 for a TV.

Warning: only 4 deploy hexes are available!
