Omdurman

September 2nd, 1898

In the years that followed the Nile Expedition, only the Abyssinians and the Italians (who, on the other hand, were sworn enemies themselves) did actually fight against the Dervishes, in Southeastern Sudan. We concentrated our efforts on rebuilding Egypt, waiting for the right time to make those madmen pay for having killed Gordon.

That moment came in 1896. The Egyptian Army was now well trained, equipped and commanded, capable of launching a successful offensive in Sudan, especially if they fought alongside some British units. So an Anglo-Egyptian Army was built, and General Kitchener was appointed as its Commander-in-Chief. He soon won some important battles in Northern Sudan, and his Army, slowly but firmly, went into the heart of the Dervish territory.

In 1898 everything was ready to give the enemy the final blow and take Omdurman, the Mahdist capital, located very near Khartoum. Kitchener needed reinforcements for that action, so the 1st Battalion of the Grenadier Guards, which I commanded at that moment, was ordered to join the Anglo-Egyptian forces. In July, 1898, we left Gibraltar and sailed to Egypt. Before the end of the summer we had joined Kitchener's Army. 

We went most of the way to Omdurman by train, so on 1st September we were already in Egeiga, within six miles of our destination and close to the bank of the Nile, where a gunboat flotilla waited in support. I knew that the Dervish army had camped very close to our lines, on the neighbouring hills. In the morning they would try to use their numerical superiority to their advantage, forcing us to retreat to the river shore, where they could destroy us.
