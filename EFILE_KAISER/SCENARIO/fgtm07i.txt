Tannenberg, 27th August, 1914
Gospodin General-Major, we have received an urgent message from Samsonov:  both of his flanks have collapsed; the enemy is on the verge of breaking through and surrounding his center corps (the XIII, XV, and XXIII).

It appears our initial estimate regarding the German retreat has been wrong:  using the slow advance of the 1st Army to their advantage, the Germans have regrouped the bulk of the 8th Army against Samsonov and have struck at his flanks.

Every minute counts now:  the II Corps' task is making contact with Samsonov with utmost urgency.
