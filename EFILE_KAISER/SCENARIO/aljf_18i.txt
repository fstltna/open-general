Dear Friend,
Once again our old friend Franz Sigel has taken command in our corps.... we have not met for a long time and the first night we talked an drank beer together...it has really been a long journey from the battlefields at the Rhine river up to here into Shenandoah valley....
Our original orders were to defend our own railway connections and to destroy the enemy ones...
But now Lee has sent General Breckinridge against us with all men he could collect...
The rebels seem to be really desperate now: they refreshed Breckinridge´s troops even with cadets from the Virginia Military Institute...
At this moment our vanguard has met Breckinridge´s men so I must hurry into our forward line...


ORDERS:
Take all VH's


ADVICE FROM YOUR OLDEST SERGEANT:
Caution ! We are deep in enemy country without lateral connection to our lines...we should reconnoiter in all directions and move forward very carefully !!!
