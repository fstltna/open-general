Commander wise Decision.The SS showing No Mercy to those in Warsaw will benefit Us.We have no Food to give to Civilians and cannot let them have stores of It while Our Armies are doing without.All Mankind is at risk here of the Bolsheviks taking over the World and only the SS aligned with the Whermacht can save It.Yes it is tough having to kill those who just want to live and be left alone but if You are not with Our Just Cause then You are against Us.If the Bolsheviks defeat Us the World is Theirs.Without Our Brave Troops battling them Who would,Amerika?Those in the United States are too Proud of themselves and too busy living the 'Good Life'.Our great German Scientist 'Heisenberg,Von'Braun and the Horten's are working to Seal the Amerikans Fate after We settle this Issue of who is 'Master in Europe'.Amerika has nothing but Fools running it and Our request for an Alliance was only answered by the threat We must not interfere with the Humanitarian Aid being sent to England.Amerika cannot stop the starving and dying on that miserable Brit isle.Amerika is pretending, sending Crums to the starving while gorging and becoming lazy and fat.Maybe a Year Amerika or two the fat will come to be Slaughtered as here in Warsaw.If You are not with Us,Yavolt?
