A tough go, Commander. Thankfully we now have possession of a strategic airfield and you have pretty much cleared the island of unfriendly natives. It's a pity that in the fighting the Japanese laboratory was completely destroyed, so we cannot guess what kind of experiments they were doing. Also the reports about the natives being nearly inmune to bullets must have been caused by bad cases of combat fatigue. 
You have been ordered back to Australia to help plan our next operation: the Philippines!
