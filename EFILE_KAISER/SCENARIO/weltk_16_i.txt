Unternehmen Teutoburg

Jun 4th, 1918

Since 1915 the Bulgarians have fought in Macedonia against superior forces. Their performance has been excellent and they've achieved quite a good number of defensive victories, but they simply aren't strong enough to attack and pierce the enemy lines. Now that the Entente Spring Offensive in France has died down, it's time to help them and to win the war in the Balkans.

It's been decided that while the Bulgarians and the Austro-Hungarians attack the Greek-British forces at the Doiran Lake you'll lead the main attack against the Franco-Serbian sector in Bitola. If, employing our infiltration tactics, you manage to break through the enemy lines the road to Athen will be open for your troops.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.

Special note: You can buy Bulgarian equipment in this scenario.
