06. SLOVAKIA (30 November 1938)

The western part of their country, Bohemia and Moravia, is ours. Only Slovakia in the east remains. Though there remain a few Kessels here and there, which require attention. But the outcome is clear: we have will gain victory!

The northern and eastern part of Slovakia contain the Tatra mountains which offer excellent positions for a last defense or guerilla activities. We cannot let the Czech 3rd Army in Slovakia retreat to those. 

We have special and new units, called Fallschirmjaeger, dropped behind enemy lines to block the roads to the Tatra mountains and to join up with Slovakian nationalist militia.

The Hungarians have attacked Slovakia from the south, as they also see who will lose and hope to get their piece of the country. They are attacking the border fortifications but it is likely they will receive a set-back any time.

Your force must advance quickly, join up with the troops dropped behind  enemy lines, and secure the area, as well as blocking the roads to the Tatra mountains in the north-east.
