The Hungarian word literally means “Line Infantry”.

It is a Regular Infantry with decent attack and defense values. It has only one minor special skill: it can use rail transport (RTP).

There were 50 battallions in the Austrian Army before the Hungarian Revolution which were recruited from the Hungarian Kingdom. Only 27 of them stationed inside the Hungarian borders and only 20 of them (the ethnic Slovakian and Hungarian battallions) were loyal to the new Government. During the summer of 1848, 5 more Hungarian battallions returned home (mostly they escaped from Galicia, ignoring their orders). There were also 18 battallions recruited from the Austrian Empire stationing in Hungary or in the special military frontier territories alongside the Turkish border (Határõrvidék, Militärgrenze, Krajina in Hungarian, German and Serbian). Before the open war was declared in October 1848, 8 of the foreign battallions were removed from Hungary. The 25 loyal regular battalions were completely merged to the 106 new Honvéd battallions only in June 1849.

These troops were well trained, well equipped, but less enthusiastic than the Honvéd battallions. Originally most of their officers were loyal to the Habsurgs, and they were replaced till Spetember 1848.
