Despite failing to re-capture Yelnya, You and Rokossovsky have shown the Germans that we will not give up. Stalin has now ordered the Reserve front onto the defensive, and has summoned you to the Kremlin. I have a feeling that he would like you to take over the defence of Leningrad from Marshal Voroshilov, whose performance has been deemed as so incompetent, that now there is a real threat that our Northern capital will fall!
