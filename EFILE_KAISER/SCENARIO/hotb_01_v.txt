Great! The Spanish defences have fallen, Vara del Rey is dead, and Linares has been wounded. Now the siege of Santiago can begin. Nothing, and nobody, will be able to get out of the town, either by land or by sea. In a few days the Spaniards will realise that there is no hope for them, and they'll surrender. 

With the Spaniards gone, Cuba will become an independent republic. Of course, we'll remind them that they owe their freedom to us. We'll make sure that they never take any decisions that could go against the interests of America.

Cuba is the great prize, but there is much more. Other Spanish possessions, like Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippines, will become American territories very soon. In fact, Philippines will be your next destination. The Spaniards have already been defeated there, but it seems that some natives still don't accept the new American sovereignty.
