Good work, General! You have shown what grim determination is able to achieve. We have made substantial territorial gains.

HISTORICAL OUTCOME:
[Historically, it wasn't the 29th Divison, but the 10th Division which attacked along the Kiretch Tepe Ridge on August 15th.]
The troops advancing along the exposed southern part of the ridge suffered badly from MG fire and well plotted Turkish artillery support. On the northern slope the 7th Munsters made a desperate bayonet charge, and for a time it looked like they may have taken the initiative, but exhaustion, thirst and the reformed Turkish lines put an end to the advance. The Irish and English troops held their ground with a grim determination when the Turks counter-attacked the following day, but without fresh troops the battalions just could not realistically hold out much longer. 
Finally, the British withdrew to their original lines on the night of the 16th August.  Over 4,000 troops and similar numbers of Turkish soldiers fell during the 2 days of fighting, yet no tactical or territorial gains were made whatsoever.
Meanwhile, General Stopford was dismissed by Hamilton on August 15th. Stopford was blamed for the failure of the Suvla operation, but responsibility ultimately lay with Lord Kitchener who, as Secretary of State for War, had appointed the elderly and inexperienced general to an active corps command.
