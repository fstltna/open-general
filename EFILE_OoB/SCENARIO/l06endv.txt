VICTORY

You have done the utmost what could be expected. The enemy was too strong and your men too weary of months of fighting. You have orders to retreat to original positions and dig in for the winter.

The next five months the division fights trench warfare without major incidents. It does not take part in the fighting at Kerch but stays part of the siege troops around Sevastopol. All units are getting rest and get replacements and reparations for the upcoming final assault on Sevastopol.
