Though they had nearly been crushed into the snow of the Russian winter, the Allies had pushed the Soviets back from the borders of Germany all the way into Moscow.  The Germans, French and British, united in their common goal, attempted to enclose Moscow into a pocket from which no supplies could reach the city. However, the Soviets crushed Erwin Rommel's German Army Group B, and the French quickly retreated.  Only the British forces remained intact and ready for battle.  The British taskforce, although severely outnumbered, was able to take the Kremlin and the rest of the city and bring the war to a close. Many Soviet officials were tried and found guilty of war crimes. However, Josef Stalin was never found. It is the opinion of the author that the British disposed of Stalin before he could be tried.  In any case, the world is a better place because of the British commander and his victory. The Allies quickly placed a sympathetic Premier into the throne of the Soviet Union, creating a peaceful nation that would never threaten Europe again.
