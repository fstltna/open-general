Well done commander!

Historical Info:

The truth is that Lapedusa was taken without a single shot fired. White flags had been sighted in the port, and when Lieutenant Corbett of "HMS Lookout" approached the port in a motor launch, he was told that the island's garrison wished to surrender. Mussolini had given the permission to do so.
