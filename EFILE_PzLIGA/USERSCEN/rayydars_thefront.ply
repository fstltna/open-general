The Front

Tovarishtsh General!

After the Great Patriotic War has settled down for a while in this sector of the front we are now supposed by STAVKA to achieve another break-through. You will be supplied with a Guards Tank Corps soon - but do not use it for the first assault! Your infantry divisions have rested in their trenches long enough and will be keen to attack again. Well, maybe they won't, but our seasoned Politruks will 'encourage' them!
Long live the Communist Party!

====================================
Good day, Herr General!

At the moment our front is sturdy, and our sparse forces have entrenched themselves as well as possible. But the Russian seems to prepare for a major assault. Of course you have to hold the front at all costs! In order to intercept eventual infiltrations we will make the XXII. Panzerkorps available to you. However, due to destroyed railway lines, it will arrive just bit by bit. I leave it to you if you 'knock or hit' - the main point is to stabilize our positions!
