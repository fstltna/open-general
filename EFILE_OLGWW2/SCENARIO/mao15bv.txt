BRILLIANT VICTORY

Chiang Kai Shek has escaped from Taipei thanks to his American friends, but the whole Taiwanese island plus other minor islands are now part of the PRC.  The Civil War is over and all the Chinese territories are now unified under the red stars flag!  Comrade Mao is pleased with you, the hero of the PRC.
