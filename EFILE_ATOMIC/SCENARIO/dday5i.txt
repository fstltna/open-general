ORDERS: 

General, Sir, while most of our troops are already approaching the French-Belgium border your units are ordered to capture Dunkerque. The Germans declared the city a fortress and are well prepared and dug in. In the surrounding area we expect only little resistance of remnants of several German infantry divisions. The Germans still control several airfields in this area and you should expect some strong Luftwaffe fighter and bomber units as well. 

The 1st Czechoslovak Armoured Brigade and some Canadian units will be under your command for this operation. You will also receive a core jet fighter for field testing and evaluation. HQ awaits your reports within a week!

A few hints: 

Please note that this is a semi-fictive scenario. In history the Dunkerque Fortress was able to fight until the very end of the second world war.
