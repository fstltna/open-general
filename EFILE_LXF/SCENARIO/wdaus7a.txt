Situation report: The situation is desperate. The Elite Japanese South Seas Detachment has landed on the north shore of New Guinea and even now is advancing over the Owen Stanley mountains toward Port Moresby. All that stands between them and complete victory is the 39th Militia, with support from the 53rd Militia. Elements of the 16th AIF Battalion are on their way to relieve the militia, but it is doubtful that they are strong enough to make any difference. You know the consquences of a Japanese Victory here. If Moresby falls, an Invasion of Australia will shortly follow. We need to stop the Japanese now.

Operational orders: Your units will be embarked immediately on troop transports bound for Port Moresby. You must disembark as quickly as is prudent and get your units to the scene of the fighting as soon as possible. This battle will decide the probable future of our nation! Victory must be achieved by any means possible!
