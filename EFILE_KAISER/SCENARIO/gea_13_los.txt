Upon the arrival of more British troops the German army has been utterly destroyed. Your campaign is over.

Historical aftermath: Following Von Lettow's own words, Mahiwa was a "brilliant victory" for his army. It was the bloodiest African battle of WWI for the British army.  It suffered more than 2,500 casualties. However, the German losses were also high and few German soldiers managed to cross the Rovuma river into Portuguese East Africa.
