"Frau Cundrie,where's the supplies I requested"? "Major Weinstrauss,their held up for the moment.We have a critical problem that no-one in this Great Crusade against the Bolsheviks paid any attention to"."I don't care about Critical Garbage,I need fuel for the Panzers and I need it now.Do I have to take out My Luger"? "Don't get pissed off at Me Major,and shooting Me won't do You any good.If somebody had checked out the difference between the Rail gauge We use and these Bolshevik Bastards Your fuel would be here instead of at Geognopolis being transfered to trucks.You probably got a wait time of 4 hours"."Four Hours. Are You out of Your mind.I got Soviets on the run and if We don't catch them they will meet up with other forces and well have to rout them again losing more Girls and tanks"."Sorry Major nothing I can do"."Ah Hell give Me that Dam phone there.Gwen You there.Get over to the Airbase and tell Frau Erkel to get some transports to Preddy,there's some fuel trucks coming Your way.Stop them,get the Fuel here to Me.Hell I don't know,if they won't stop shoot the Dam drivers.Just get Me that fuel,My Panzers are sitting still,the Crews got nothing to do but polish their nails and I aint happy about that.Yeh okay,Hey I was kidding about shooting the drivers now.Well Frau see there,It won't take no 4 hours.Now how much ammunition You got"? "I guess You better reach for that Luger Major and have some of those planes fly to Tremkosnov, as I said 4 hours if not more".
