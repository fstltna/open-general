Narvik

We have reached the last ''hot point'' in Norway. The allies have a good number of troops here, some of our troops are in the area yet, but they have been stopped by the allies. You must break out to Narvik and all the nearby areas. The Kriegsmarine is in the area to help us, but Im sure the Royal Navy will come for disturb our plains... Good luck.
