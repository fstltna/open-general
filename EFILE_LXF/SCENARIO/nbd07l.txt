Commander, we are happy you made it out of that carnage alive!  The loss at Kasserine has dealt us a crushing blow.  Our men fought bravely, but they were no match for the Afrika Korps. Still, your leadership was outstanding in managing to preserve any of your units at all.  Your men are being reequipped and you will soon have another shot at the enemy.
