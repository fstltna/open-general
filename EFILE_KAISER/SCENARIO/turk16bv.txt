Transjordan Attack  - brilliant victory

This victory will stop the British for a while. Congratulations!

Historical outcome 
Although the first and second Transjordan operations were a distinct tactical defeat, the British losses were not too heavy; about 500 in the mounted divisions and 1,100 in the infantry.  Nearly 1,000 prisoners were captured. 

The strategic effect was nevertheless favourable, due to the fact that from then on, one third of the total German and Ottoman forces had to be stationed east of the Jordan. These two operations had convinced the German and Ottoman High Command that their left flank would be the main focus of British offensive activity, and that Allenby would not advance on the coastal plain until he had secured his right flank with the capture of Amman. 
As a result, during 1918 the whole of the Ottoman 4th Army was employed in monitoring and harassing the occupation of the Jordan Valley by the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, leaving the extreme right of their line comparatively weak and giving Allenby an opportunity to attack on the coast of the Mediterranean in mid-September 1918. That British final offensive ended with a total Ottoman defeat, and forced the Turks to ask for an armistice on October 1918.
