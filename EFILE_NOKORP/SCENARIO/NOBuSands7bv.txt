Excellent! With the port of Tobruk we're back in the race, the first Italian cargo ships with supplies are on the way, the time the Italian navy secures the area from any British nuisances.

For your outstanding leadership and the capacity to handle whatever the British throw at you, you've been promoted to General der Panzertruppe.
Congratulations! You're one of our most promising generals. Keep up the good work!
