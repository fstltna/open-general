18. MIVO RIVER COUNTERATTACK (5 July 1945)

The time has to come to cross the Mivo River in strength and open the way to Buin. 29th Brigade has taken over from15th Brigade. Japanese activity has been increasing again, just like before the Japanese counterattack against Slater's Knoll earlier this year. Headquarters has given orders to advance and has only set limited objectives for now as it is expected that the enemy will conduct a minor or major counterattack to throw us back over the Mivo River. Good luck, commander!
