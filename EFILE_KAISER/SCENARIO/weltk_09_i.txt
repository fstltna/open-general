The Romanian front: Hermannstadt

Sep 26th, 1916

These Romanians are really brave. As soon as they declared war on Austria-Hungary they crossed the Carpathian passes, invading the Kingdom of Hungary and defeating the local garrisons. Some days ago they were in the outskirts of Hermannstadt, and only when they learnt that you were coming to help our allies did they retreat, stablishing a defence line and guarding the Rothenturm Pass.
We must get rid of the Romanians as soon as possible. Our Bulgarian friends, along with some German and Ottoman units, will attack the Romanian divisions in Dobrudscha and the lower Donau. In the meantime our main forces, including your elite corps, will attack at the mountains. If you conquer the Rothenturm Pass the way to Bukarest will be open and this battlefront will be pacified. Run, General, there is no time to lose!

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.

Special note: You can buy Austro-Hungarian equipment in this scenario.

Intelligence report: We know that the Romanians have blown up most of the bridges and laid minefields along your way in order to delay you. You'll have to find he way to remove those obstacles.
