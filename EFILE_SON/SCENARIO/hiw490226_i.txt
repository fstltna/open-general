Kápolna
February 26, 1849

Colonel! As you know, Görgei joined our main forces successfully and pushed back Schlik’s corps. During this advance we met two imperial corps led by Windisch-Grätz near village Kápolna. Our troops have too many recruits, they aren’t strong enough to handle the united imperial army. Try to prevent them from joining.

Deploy Hexes: 20

ORDER: Hold at least 4 VHs.

NOTE: Both sides get valuable reinforcements.
