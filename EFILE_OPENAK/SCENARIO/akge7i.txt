The Soviet Union has invaded Finland, Herr General, and our Finnish friends have trapped a Soviet division in the town of Suomussalmi. Unfortunately, an even greater Soviet relief force is moving to aid their comrades, and the Finns are outnumbered. It is your task to destroy the isolated enemy and prevent the relief force from reaching him. Of course, due to our non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union, you and your troops will be considered volunteers.  If you are defeated, the General Staff will deny any knowledge of your participation, and you may expect the worst if captured.
