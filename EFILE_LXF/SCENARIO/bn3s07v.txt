General Michitaro Komatsubara

What a battle, General!  The Russians have agreed to negotiations to end the border conflict and have assured us sweeping concessions.  Your masterful victory will be celebrated in the whole Empire and you are expected at GHQ to receive a special honour.  My Congratulations, General!
