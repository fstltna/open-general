Malta

Aug 16th, 1919

When France finally surrendered in June, torn apart by foreign armies and an internal revolution, we believed that the war would finish. But we were wrong. Britain still refuses to sign a peace treaty. Its government knows that since Germany will never be able to invade the British Islands, the country is safe. So they intend to continue the naval blockade against continental Europe hoping that, in the long term, hunger will force us to give in.

So, if we want peace, we must scare the British. We may not have the power to invade England, but we certainly could attack some strategical British bases in the Mittelmeer. It has been decided that the Germans will attack the Sueskanal and, at the same time, you'll disembark in Malta. If the British lose the Mediterranean route, they won't be able to control India and other important colonies. The British Empire would be in danger and, before it could fall, they'd choose to make peace with us.

I pray for your success. This one could be the last battle of this war.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.

Special notes: 
- You won't have any supply hexes in this scenario.
