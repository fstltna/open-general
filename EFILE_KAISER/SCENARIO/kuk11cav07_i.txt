Bilgoraj
(June 17, 1915)

Your division is now part of the 11th German Army, which is chasing the disarrayed Russian troops. The Russians are retreating out of Galicia, so we are presented with a good chance to exploit the situation and deal them a severe blow.

ORDER: Keep your MSU alive and prevent the escape of more than 4 enemy ground units.

NOTE: The German auxes are commanded by AI. They might need your help.
