The Fourth Battle of Kharkov - August 1943
The Soviet 5th Guards tank army that got badly mauled at Prokhorovka when meeting your forces in mid July has been rebuilt. It has rushed through the gap between our 4th Pz Army and Group Kempf and is now threatening Kharkov. A Kampfgruppe of the 3rd Pz Division, the 198ID and some corps troops are defending the city. They urgently need your help to stop the flood of T34 tanks.
