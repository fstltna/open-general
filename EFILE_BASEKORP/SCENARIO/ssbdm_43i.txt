   'The End of the Royal Navy' 
  Where had it all gone wrong?A once and powerful force now just trying to escape anihilation.The only chance for survival was to fight it's way into open waters against the Italian fleet.Italian ground forces were closing on the port and the ships loaded all they could for the 'Run to America'.The few Squadrons of the RAF which had been decimated by the SS/BdM 'Frau-Z's aiding the Italians had done cut out for the most part leaving Italian Flyers to aid in the attacks on the ships of the Royal Navy and it's Allies.So for the Glory of Dear Ole England Admiral Sir Philip Vian of the flagship HMS King George shook hands with Major Bertrand Collins of the 'Kings Rifles Armor and boarded His ship, "Well Bert,this is It.As I You know Our Salvation and that of the Ilse's could have been if the 'Yanks had shown a little more interest in the Affairs of Western Europe.But it not being 'Their Problem' has doomed all Mankind to that Whore in Black ruling the World".The 'Sand' was lost and with It all the Oil.With what the 'Frau's were doing in Russia and the United States once again failing to defeat the Japanese in the Solomon islands the Axis was on the Brink of Total Victory across the Globe.Admiral Vian retired to His Quarters to rest His weary head.Moments later a message.The Italian Fleet was spotted.The 'Run' might not even get in a few Good Steps and the Admiral may soon get all the rest He would ever want.
