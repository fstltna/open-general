VICTORY

Brilliant, comrade. You have taken Feodosiya and repulsed all fascist counterattacks! The landing near Kerch has been an equal success. The enemy was quick enough to retreat and build a new defensive line, but we are in possession of the Kerch peninsula from Kerch to Feodisya and have drained away enemy forces that could otherwise attack Sevastopol.
