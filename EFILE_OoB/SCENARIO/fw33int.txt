Brest - Litovsk

The OKH has decided to attack this area, I should say that Brest-Litvosk has no operational interest for us, however we know that the Soviets will invade Poland in the next days, so we must capture the city and the fortress first! Then, we will be able to ''gift''it to the Soviets. Your mission is to reach the Bug river and capture all the goals. The enemy forces consist of the remnants of the Army of Prusy and the Operative group of Wyszkow. You will receive Luftwaffe support.
