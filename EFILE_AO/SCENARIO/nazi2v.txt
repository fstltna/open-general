Herr Feldmarschall,

Today is a great victory for the German people.  Hiroshima and Nagasaki, obliterated in clouds of nuclear fire, force the Emperor to offer a full scale surrender of all Japanese forces across the globe.

Soon we will occupy Japan, Herr Feldmarschall, and through peaceful means.  German influence reigns unchallenged throughout the world.  You are to be commended for your many victories by Herr Hitler himself.
