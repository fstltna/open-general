Welcome back, Commander. I hope you enjoyed your vacation, but things have erupted out of control. Stalin, apparently getting desperate at the outcome of the war, has begun building nuclear weapons. A Soviet scientist wishes to defect to our cause, bringing with him intimate knowledge of Stalin's nuclear weapon program. However, there is a limited gap of time for us to rescue him from the Soviet base in Riga before Soviet units arrive to reinforce the base. Our forces have begun an amphibious landing in the area. Secure the area as quickly and efficently as possible, to retrieve the scientist's crucial information and also to begin the liberation of the Baltic states.
