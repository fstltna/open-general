12. Breakthrough into the Po Valley, April 14th, 1945

Your division played no more than a very minor role in the past half year's attempts to break through the Gothic line and into the Po river Valley. That is about to change. If your attack succeeds, we can push the Germans into the Alps and open the doors to the Balkans.

ORDERS
Exit a total of five units through any of the exit hexes on the North of the map.

Expect no reinforcements.

NOTES: 
- This is the last scenario of this campaign.
