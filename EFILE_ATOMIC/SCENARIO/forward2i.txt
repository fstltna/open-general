Pocket of Minsk:
Comrade General, you surely know that the Germans have assaulted our country. Now, the situation is really delicate. While we are speaking, every moment German troops can fulfill the closing of the Minsker pocket. The Panzergruppe 2 and 3 have bypassed Minsk in the northern and southern and every moment they can team up near of Borissow to close the pocket. You have the permission to evacuate the pocket in need. But you should try to hold Minsk, the Minsker Airfield and Borissow as long as possible. 
Your troops:
You will get help from the soviet Westfront. These troops have only few tank divisions but many artilleries and especially infantry divisions.
 Enemy troops:
You are facing a large part of the Heeresgruppe Mitte. The Germans have contracted a lot of tanks, infantry, artillery, 8.8 PAK and bombers west of Minsk. Hoths Panzergruppe 3 is attacking from the north, Panzergruppe 2 under Guderian is attacking from the south. You will have contact with these troops soon, too. 
Attention! Trying to hold Minsk can be really hard. The Germans are much more experienced then you. If you are a bad player you can evacuate Minsk and trying to hold Borissow and expect the enemy in the outback
Sgn. Major Heinz
