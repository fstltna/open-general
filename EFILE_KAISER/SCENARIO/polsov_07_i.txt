Surviving the red tide

June 4th, 1920

The Russian counterattack is a nightmare that has come true. They are trying to surround and crush our 3rd Army and we won't be able to resist their pressure until reinforcements arrive. We'll have to evacuate Kijów but we need some time to organize our troops and retreat in an orderly fashion towards our rear defence lines. You must resist the enemy attacks for as long as you can so that the rest of our troops have the time they need to retreat safely. 

Victory conditions: After 18 turns you must hold 7 VHs for a BV, 5 VHs for a V, or 3 VHs for a TV.

Intelligence report: Most of the Soviet units are believed to be gathering near the Rastavitsa River and the forests by the eastern shore of the Teterev. You should build solid lines of defence as fast as possible using the terrain features wisely. Your engineer troops can be very useful in delaying the Russian advance.

Good luck!

Note: You can buy Ukrainian units in this scenario.
