General,

I know the situation is dramatic and our troops are exhausted but I was expecting much more from you as commander.

You better ressign and open a "gaufre" shop. 

Le Chef d'Etat-major général de l’armée (EMGA).

Historical note: 

Despite several attacks the German troops could not take the town of Vinkt. Both in Meigem and Vinkt the Germans suffered heavy casualties. German frustration was that high that 140 civilians were killed in the space of just a few days.

As the front on the Leie/Lys river was broken on the 27th May the order was given for a new retreat and Belgian troops evacuated Vinkt. Although some units managed to retreat to their new positions, the situation was dramatic: German breakthroughs everywhere, increasing casualties, lack of supplies, lack of contacts with some units... It was clear that the Belgian army was falling apart. Unlike in 1914 a retreat towards the Ijzer/Yser River was not possible.
