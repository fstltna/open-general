The bear against the red wolves: Chelyabinsk

July 25th, 1919

While we were successfully evacuating Ekaterinburg, we received worrisome news from our left flank. The Soviet 5th Army was attacking our Chebarkul-Irtyash line. Our High Command believed that our men couldn't resist for a long time there, so very soon the city of Chelyabinsk would be in danger, too.

The High Command reacted quickly. All ou army was reorganized, our units went to the Chelyabinsk area as a reinforcement, and as a part of our newly created 3rd Army we were told to deploy southeast of Chelyabinsk. The plan was to lure the Red units into the city, and then encircle them and defeat them.

On July 24th the Reds entered Chelyabinsk. Our couteroffensive would start the next day. The northern group (under the command of the Czech Sergej Vojcechovsky) would cut the railway Chelyabinsk - Ekaterinburg and advance into the rear of the 5th Army. In the meantime, our southern group, commanded by Kappel, would destroy the Soviet 26th Division, closing the trap.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.
