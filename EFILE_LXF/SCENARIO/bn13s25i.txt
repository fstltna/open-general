
TOULON-MARSEILLES - 18 AUG 1944

On August 15 the invasion of southern France, Operation Dragoon, begins. The invasion is successful and soon US and French forces split; US forces advancing generally east towards Cannes and Nice and French advancing the west towards Toulon and Marseilles. Once Provence is cleared the plan is to move north and link with Allied forces advancing out of Normandy.

But first Toulon and Marseilles must be liberated. Your Corps is brought into action and you are given the honour of commanding the assault on these important harbours. Both cities are fortified and the enemy is known to be ready to fanatically defend.

GOAL: Take all VH's!
