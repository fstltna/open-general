"Comrade Miska,are You there.Did You get through their line"? "No Marshal Serov,We have lost all the Tanks.The Fraus have a New Tank-Destroyer and it has cut Us to pieces"."What about the Air,what's the story there"? "It's the same it has always been in this Dam War,that twin engine Fighter of theirs has cleared Our planes out of the Sky as usual.We've lost the War Serov,Moscow will be under the Gun soon.I'm packing up My shit now and heading to meet My family,were running"."Well thanks Comrade,We were doomed from the start.Stalins orders and His murdering of the Officers Corps from the Get-go just paralyzed too many Commanders from taking the iniative at the Crucial moments.Still it's hard to believe these Frau's have beat Our numbers.Shame We have lost so many Comrades.I cannot get to My Family so I will return to the Kremlin and face Stalin,I will tell Him the Good News that the War is coming to an End but not the One the 'Boss envisioned.Should be a Hell of a look on His face before He has Me shot.But he'll get His.Either the Frau's will get Him or Our Countrymen.The number of Russian sons and daughters Stalin has sacrificed in this Crusade against the SS will be avenged there's no doubt in My Mind.The NKVD cannot protect the 'Boss forever.Good Luck Miska,tell Your wife I will miss Her cooking. Serov out".
