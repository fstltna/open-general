Return to the Isonzo

Aug 6th, 1916

Welcome back to the Isonzo, General. Since you were here more than a year ago, the Italians have assaulted our positions four more times. We've managed to reject all of their attacks, but our casualties have been very high, and it seems that our enemies won't give up. They'll keep on trying as long as there is one single Italian soldier alive.

We think that a new Italian offensive is imminent, and that it can be the worst that we've endured so far. Thank God that you're here. Your men already know the terrain, and when the Italians attack you'll know how to stop them. If you don't, we'll be in serious trouble.

Victory conditions:
- After 12 turns you must hold 6 VHs for a BV, 5 VHs for a V and 3 VHs for a TV.

Special note: 
- In this scenario the "skip first player turn" option is activated.
