Diamond Hill

June 11th, 1900

As I said before, with Roberts and Kitchener came massive British reinforcements. Outnumbered four to one, the Boer had to retire from virtually all the towns and the other relevant positions, most of the time without a fight. By March 1900 they had been forced to fight a guerrilla warfare, with sporadic attacks on our supply lines.

With the aim of defeating the guerrillas Roberts and Kitchener created a system of blockhouses and ordered a scorched earth policy; Boer civilians had to be deported, farms and crops burnt, cattle shot, and wells poisoned, thus depriving the enemy of all kinds of support. I was naturally repulsed by these orders. For the first time in my life I believed that, by following them, I was not serving my country, but disgracing it. To make things even worse, the harsh South African environment was deteriorating my health alarmingly fast. Some days I was so weak that I could not even leave my private wagon and take charge of my troops.

Since we had joined the 11th división in February, and as a part of Roberts's army, we had taken Bloemfontein, Johannesburg and, finally, Pretoria, without any serious fighting. But a week after the fall of Pretoria, the enemy still wandered the hills east of the town. After months of secondary and degrading tasks we were finally given the order of attacking and forcing the Boer to retreat.
