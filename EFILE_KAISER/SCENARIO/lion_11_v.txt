After taking Adi Quala, many other villages and towns fell, too. Gura, Barentu and Agordat were the most important ones. My father had fought many battles in that area, either against the Egyptians or against the Dervishes. Knowing that I was following his steps, I was ecstatic.

Those losses were a terrible blow for the Italians who, under British pressure, finally offered us a ceasefire, and the start of peace negotiations. We didn't trust Italy's intentions, but if we didn't accept, Britain would attack us, so we had to comply with their request. Peace negotiations started in Kasala on April 21.
