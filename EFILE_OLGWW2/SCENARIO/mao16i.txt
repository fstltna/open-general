Sino - Soviet Incident

1-10-1955, Amur river, Sino-Soviet border, near Khabarovsk, Far Eastern Siberia.

A chain of unfortunate incidents with the Soviets along the Chinese - Soviet border has opened the way for the outbreak of full scale military operations.  As you know, the relationship with our former Soviet allies has badly deteriorated.  Moscow doesn't like our own interpretation of Marxism and wants to take us back to the ''correct'' communist system.  To punish us, they have launched an invasion across the Amur River, the natural border between the PRC and the USSR.  They have captured a many square kilometers of Chinese territory, including some villages.

You are the commander of the best units in the whole PLA, and your mission is to counter-strike the Soviet invaders.  If we want to continue with our own interpretation of the Marxism, we must defeat the Soviets.  Also Mao would be most pleased, if your men capture the important city of Khabarovsk.  He says that these territories are historically Chinese and no soviets must remain on Chinese lands! 

Fu qi!
