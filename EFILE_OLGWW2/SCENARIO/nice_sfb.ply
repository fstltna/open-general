Nice or Bust!

"I only need a few thousand dead so that I can sit at the peace conference as a man who has fought" (Gen. Pietro Badoglio, Chief of Staff of the Italian Royal Army).

"On this tenth day of June 1940, the hand that held the dagger has struck it into the back of its neighbor." (Franklin D. Roosevelt, president of the USA, about the italian declaration of war on France).

As the things were becoming clear in France, Mussolini, thinking it would be an easy job, took the opportunity to seize the claimed territory of the Alps and the region around the city of Nice. However, the invasion soon proved to be not so easy for the italians, as the french army showed no mercy with the invasors at the Alps.

Try to do it better than the italians, adding some french territories for the new italian empire of Mussolini.

*Tip* The italian Reggia Aeronautica will need an airstrip to supply their planes. Build one in a proper place with your engineers.
