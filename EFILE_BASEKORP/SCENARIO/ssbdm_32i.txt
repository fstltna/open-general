At Lenningrad Airfield 9 the Frau-Z touching down then the landing gear giving way.The plane sliding across the runway turning into a fireball.The Plane almost to a stop and Tikka jumps out rolling away from the burning bird,get's up to Her feet and casually strolls by the Fire units and ambulance.The sight of the armor is reported,the message sent to Frau General Pedderson.Berlin is contacted."Yes this is the Fuhress.I see General.I know they seem to have an endless supply.Yes sure the Girls there have had their fill.I'll see who I can move to aid.It has to stop sometime Pedderson. When it does I imagine Your Panzers will be able to roll up the area.Yes I know,Good Luck". General Pedderson met with Her Panzer Commanders breaking the news.She could see the looks on their faces knowing they seemed to be taking the Burden of the whole Soviet Army."It has to break sometime" She told them."Sure" PZ commander Stowe said, "When they roll into Berlin".
