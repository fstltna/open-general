Historical Note:

 As late as April 30th and May 1st, the Nazi leaders were still playing for time, opening talks for a cease-fire in Berlin and calling on Admiral Donitz's newly proclaimed government to negotiate Germany's surrender. The Soviets held fast to the demand that Germany unconditionally surrender to all the Allies before military activities would be halted. The last ditch German attempt to sow disunity between the Allies had failed. The Soviet forces were then given the order to finish off the enemy. On May 1st 1945 at 6:30pm, the final assault on the center of Berlin began. By 3:00pm May 2nd, it was all over, and from the Reichstag waved the Hammer & Sickle. The fall of Berlin and the link up between the Soviet armies and the Allied troops led to the final collapse of Nazi Germany. The disorganized German army was no longer capable of resistance. Everywhere in Italy and Western Europe, German troops began to capitulate. On May 8th representatives of the German command signed the Act of Unconditional Surrender, thus acknowledging their total defeat...
