1921 Defense of Annual

July, 16th, 1921

Message from General Fernández Silvestre's HQ:

General, thank God you are here! Our advance into the Rif mountains, west of Melilla,  has met much more resistance than we had expected. The "kabilas" from the Rif are commanded by the Cadi, Abd el-Krim al Jatabbi, a former employee of the colonial administration in the Office of Indigenous Affairs in Melilla who has been educated in Spain, and now is the leader of the Beni Urriaguel tribe. Abd el-Krim has declared jihad against the Spanish invaders, and in June our offensive halted when the Berbers retook the position at Abarrán. 

From my HQ at Annual I can see how the number of enemies grows day by day. It's obvious that a huge Berber counteroffensive is imminent, and the Spanish soldiers that defend Annual are inexperienced and demoralized. We must retreat from the mountains of the Rif. Before your arrival I thought that it would be immposible, and I was about to lose my sanity. Now I can see a glimpse of hope.


Victory conditions: After 20 turns you must hold 7 VHs for a brilliant victory, 5 VHs for a victory and 4 VHs for a tactical victory.
