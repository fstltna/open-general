    TACAM R-2 tank destroyer

    The stringent need for modernising the Romanian armoured force made the specialists of the Ministry of Army Endowment and War Production to study the possibility of upgrading the R-2 tank in early 1943.
     It was accepted to convert the vehicle into a self-propelled gun by using the captured 76.2mm artillery pieces and armour plates of the captured T-26 and T-60 tanks.
    On 12 February 1944 the military officials decided that forty R-2 tanks to be converted in TACAMs. On July 22nd 1944 the High Command of Motomechanized Troops suspended the production of the last twenty TACAMs, resulting a total of twenty-one produced together with the prototype. In July 1944, the TACAM R-2s were distributed to the 1st Tank Regiment were they formed the 63th Tank-destroyer Company. They were used in the liberation of Romanian territory, by September 1944 only six serviceable TACAM R-2s remaining. After the 1st Tank Regiment was disbanded at Soviet order, the six TACAMs entered the composition of the 2nd Tank Regiment and took part in the operations in Austria and Moravia, at the end of the war only one surviving.
