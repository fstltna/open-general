Is it not ironic that communist allies can count on each other while capitalist allies cannot?  A tactical victory has been gained at Hoengsong and to the west at Chip'yong-ni the Chinese were close to eliminating another pocket of encircled imperialist forces. Unfortunately the UN forces are too powerful at the moment and our communist offensive has ground to a halt.  You are right, Comrade General, we will pull back some miles to better positions and hold them as we ready ourselves for an even larger offensive this spring!

AFTERMATH

The limited communist offensive ended in several tactical victories without breaking the United Nations frontline.  The US 8th Army recaptured the lost terrain with Operation Killer in late February.  Bad weather made it easy for the communists to retreat in good order.  This UN counteroffensive in the central sector was continued in Operation Ripper which immediately followed with Operation Killer.  However the front near Seoul remained static until the end of March when there too, offensive operations were resumed.
