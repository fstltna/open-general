Battle of Wollin
September 16, 1759

In August two Swedish corpses, supported by the galley flotilla, were directed against the islands of Usedom and Wollin at the mouth of the Oder. The plan was to capture these two islands and then to enter in the eastern part of the Stettin Lagoon with the galley flotilla. On September 16, after a preparation of artillery, Fredrik Axel von Fersen launched his troops against the walls of Wollin.
