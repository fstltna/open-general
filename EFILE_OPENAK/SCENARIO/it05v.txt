BEDA-FOMM February1941 V

Congratulations Generale. You broke through the English roadblock and brought your troops safely into Tripolitania.

The Germans responded to our requests for help and have sent over General Erwin Rommel with what should soon be 2 divisions. The German Fliegerkorps X was moved from Norway to Sicily December last year to patrol the sea lines between Italy and Libya.
