The loss of their Sixth Army has been too much for the Reds who, under British pressure, have offered us an armistice. They say that they'll retire from Crimea and Taman, where the United Kingdom will support the creation of a Free Crimean State under our control.

Although some of my fellow officers are ecstatic with those news, I'm skeptical about them. In a few years' time the Red Army will have grown stronger, so the Bolsheviks will probably attack us again. Then the British, who have already betrayed us once, will surely forsake us one more time.

However, I admit that, for now, living in a free Crimea is better that going into exile. And if we choose the right policies, our new country could thrive. Then we could afford a modern Army, capable of deterring our enemies. At the moment that's just a castle in the air but if we all work hard in the same direction, who knows? Maybe we could make it real.

The campaign is over. I hope you've liked it, and thanks for playing.
