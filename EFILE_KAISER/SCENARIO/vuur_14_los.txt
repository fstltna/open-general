Sadly the British have retreated in perfect order. They're still a menacing army, and our troops are too tired to keep on attacking them. We'll have to lift the siege of Kimberley and go on the defensive.

Besides in the front of Ladysmith, and after three failed attempts, General Buller finally managed to defeat our troops, commanded by General Botha, and a few days ago he lifted the siege of the town. Soon the British will launch new attacks, and I'm afraid that we won't have the strength to repel their invasion.
