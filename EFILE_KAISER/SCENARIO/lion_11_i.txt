Second battle of Gundet - Mar 23rd, 1917

"The hope of the righteous shall be gladness, but the expectation of the wicked shall perish"
Prov. 10, 28

In the last days of 1916 we retook Adwa and Adigrat, but then we had to stop our advance for some weeks, while we completed the much needed reform of our army. However, when we finally entered Eritrea, nothing could stop my men.

It's difficult to describe the excitement that I felt when we approached the villages where my father had fought against the Egyptians, so many years ago. Adi Quala and Gura were within reach, and I promised myself that, this time, we would remain here forever.

Victory conditions: 
Take all the VHs.
