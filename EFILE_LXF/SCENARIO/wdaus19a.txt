Situation report: Now that Balikpapan is secure, our next target will be the city of Samarinda, the oilfields that lie to the northwest and the airfields along the coast. Strategically, this will spell the end of the Japanese in Borneo.  

Operational orders: You will be tasked with driving the enemy from the Samarinda region. The enemy is desperate and you can be assured that he will pull out all stops to defeat you. This will be the last major operation that you are expected to carry out for the time being. After this mission, your troops will be replaced by fresh troops from Australia and you will be brought home to a hero's welcome.
