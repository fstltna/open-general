Assault on Tobruk

The german advance in northern africa under the command of Erwin Rommel was characterized by speed, that's why the heavy fortified place was first only surrounded and not conquered to be able to advance rapidly further on.

In that situation Tobruk was defended by an australian unit, which had successfully prevented Tobruk from beeing conquered by the German Africa Corps in april two times. The deeply organized defending positions, consisting of tank ditches, bunker, machine gun holes and AT nests, were making a advance in the town nearly impossible. Until the end of 1941 the place was sieged and massively bombarded by the german airforce. In the frame of "Operation Crusader" in december of 1941 the defenders were liberated.

In may 1942 the town was once again the goal of german-italian advances and only after two weeks of heavy fightings the axis forces were able to break the lines of the defenders.

The mission of the german commander is to break the defending positions and to conquer Tobruk.

The british commander must held Tobruk at all costs.
