Herr General, as you are aware the USA troops are attacking Berlin. Their massive bombing raids are making it difficult to defend the city. They must not take all the bridges into Berlin. The only troops we have defending the city are old men. You must attack their troops and push them clear of the city. If you can do this we may be able to negotiate a ceasefire.
