Stavropol

Nov 10th, 1918

Our campaign in the Kuban against the Red Army of the Northern Caucasus, now renamed 11th Army, still goes on. We hardly got time to mourn the death of General Alekseyev, who finally succumbed to his illness in September, before putting into practice the last step of our strategy.
The plan consists in surrounding the Bolsheviks from east, west and north, and push them against the Caucasus. However, the enemy's numerical superiority is so great that our encirclement has been merely theoretical. If the Soviet hordes actually behaved like a true army they could break our lines at any place and march wherever they pleased. We're lucky that they've spent much time quarrelling and killing each other. Even their leader Sorokin has been shot.

That doesn't mean that the Bolsheviks are harmless madmen. A most bloody battle is taking place near Stavropol. Twice did we take this town, only to lose it again shortly afterwards under the pressure of fierce enemy counterattacks. Our casualties are really heavy, including General Drozdovsky, who was badly injured and might not survive.

General Denikin, who after Alekseyev's passing has become our sole leader, has ordered me to attempt a third, and hopefully final, assault on Stavropol, while Wrangel's men storm Armavir, in the west. Fortunately my health problems seem to be over, so I can employ all my energies in destroying the 11th Army.

Victory conditions: 
- Take all the VHs.

Intelligence report:
- It seems that the Soviets are preparing a counterattack in the north, where the 2nd Division is staying.
