The First World War - Chemin des Dames - April, 16th, 1917
(The Nivelle Offensive)

Ma chère Fabienne,

I hope, you recovered from your flu. 
Now that our oldest grandson, Jean-Pierre, has joined our Army, I pray every evening for him and for you. I remember that you begged me to do something for him, and make sure that he would be at a safe position in our rear. But, ma chère Fabienne, I haven't so much influence in our Supreme Command.

Besides, the truth is that I've spoken with Jean-Pierre, and he doesn't want any special treatment just because he's my grandon, so he went to our first line. I can understand it: In these times we all must do our duty. Ils ne passeront pas!

I'm sitting here at our first line, too; staring at the horizon. It's indescribably: right now I'm seeing an ocean of flames, and there is so much noise that I can't speak to my men. Our artillery has been firing at the German lines for ten days, in preparation for our grand offensive, which will start at any time.

It will be our first offensive against the Germans since 1915. But, wait...Silence! 

I can't continue writing. It's time for our attack...

Je t'aime,

Jean-Babtiste.


ORDERS:(from General Nivelle:) General, your orders are clear and easy: break through the enemy Lines, recapture the Chemin des Dames and take your advance to the city of Laon.
It should be a walk, after our immense artillery preparation.

OBJECTIVES: Take all VH's

REMARKS: Attention! Maybe our Supreme Command is too optimistic...!
