South Africa continues supporting the UNITA guerrillas agaisnt the FAPLA, the armed wing of the communist party of Angola, the MPLA, trying to eliminate the problematic communist goverment of Angola. The affair became into a serious problem near the northern Namibian's border, when the FAPLA began receiving big support from Cuba. Then, the angolans attacked the UNITA positions with 5 brigades heavily equipped with tanks and other weapons of soviet procedence, reaching the vicitinies of the town of Mavinga. Thus, the South African Defense Force sent full support to the UNITA to stop the offensive, and even, take the enemy base at Cuito Cuanavale.
