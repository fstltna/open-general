TOBRUK - THE EASTERN OFFENSIVE April14 1941

The 5th Leichte Division's 5th Pz.Rgt. and 8th Mg.Btn. have breached the Tobruk Perimeter this morning. Unfortunately the Panzers got separated from the infantry which got pinned down. 

Several Brescia and Trento division troops are ready for a diversion West of the breach. Support those efforts and send troops to dislodge the German units. 

The diversion must reach as far as Fort Pilastrino and 8th Mg.Btn. must survive!

Orders
Capture all Victory hexes and keep at least one of the four 'Must-Survive-Units' alive.
