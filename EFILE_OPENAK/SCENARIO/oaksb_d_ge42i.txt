For far too long, the English based on Malta have interrupted our flow of supplies to North Africa.  You have been selected to lead an elite assault force and subdue this enemy stronghold.  You must secure all the island's harbors and airfields so that our hold on the Mediterranean is secure.

You must preserve the Italian capital ships.  We went to a great deal of trouble convincing them to join us in this assault on the British at sea, we will need them again in the future and we must not let the heart be cut out of their navy.

Our Mediterranean wolf packs have spent the weeks leading to this operation cutting off support for the British troops on Malta.  You will have command of them as well for the duration of this operation.  We must not let the British bring the strength of their navy to bear on our ground assault forces.

Note:  The starting German airfield is a supply hex, but it does not allow for reinforcement of ground units.
