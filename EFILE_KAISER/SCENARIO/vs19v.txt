Battle of Loos - Hohenzollern Redoubt - Early October 1915 - V

Congratulations for the way in which you conducted the counterattacks that retook most of the territory gained by the British.

Historical events (Autumn offensive):

In the autumn of 1915 the French and British Armies carried out a second large-scale, two-pronged offensive against the German positions, which were by this time well-consolidated and proving increasingly more difficult to break into. The Second Champagne Offensive (25th September - 6th November 1915), had the objective of forcing the German Third and Fifth Armies in the Argonne sector to withdraw along the Meuse river towards Belgium. A simultaneous attack by French and British forces from Vimy Ridge to La Bassée, called the Artois-Loos Offensive or the Third Battle of Artois (25th September - 15th October 1915), aimed to break through the German Front in Artois. This would compel the German Second and Seventh Armies caught between the two attacks to pull back to the Belgian border in order to protect their road and rail routes in their Lines of Communication on the Douai plain.

The Champagne offensive gained a few miles of ground and captured some 25,000 German prisoners, but with German reinforcements brought into the sector from the Eastern Front, the French could not withstand repeated German counter-attacks. French losses were over 145,000 casualties by the time the Champagne offensive drew to a close. 

The Artois-Loos offensive started well for the British forces, but bad management of reinforcements meant no breakthrough could be achieved and little of strategic value was gained. British losses totalled about 60,000 and French losses about 50,000. German losses were about 50,000.
