This will be a battle to be remembered. The British have pulled everything they have and put it against us; On our side the Italians have freed enough troops for us to have a serious chance of breaking through.
If El Alamein falls, the British are finished: We will have them running from here to Cairo, so do your best. This is the day, and this is the place.
