Our invasion of Serbia has failed. Our men are retreating, and in a few hours all of them will have crossed the Drina again. This has been one of the worst defeats in the history of Austria or Hungary.

In the east things have gone badly, too. The Russians overcame us. Lemberg has fallen, Przemysl is under siege, and our enemies almost invaded the Hungarian plains. Only their own mistakes, the weather and the Germans prevented it.

Before the war started, we all knew that our army needed some important reforms, better funding, modern equipment and proper training and leadership, but nobody could foresee this disaster. We thought that what we had was enough to beat Serbia and, at the very least, to hold the Russians for some months.

Reality was very different, though. Well, now we know how weak we are. And our enemies know it, too. The following months will be terrible for the Empire. We must prepare ourselves for a long, ugly war. On the positive side, Serbia has suffered greatly during this year, too, so I don't think they'll attack us in the near future.
