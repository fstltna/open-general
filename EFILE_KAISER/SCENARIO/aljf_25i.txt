June, 23., 1865  Final Assault at Richmond


Dear Friend,
it is now that we are in front of the lion´s hole... the lion is hurted and has drawn back to the outmost corner of his cave... but he still is really dangerous..... may be even more dangerous then ever... before as he knows there is nothing to lose for him....

I do not know how this will end, but I feel this is the end of the war.. one way or the other..this is the final decision...
Wish me the best of luck. 
I close this letter and will go to my men... it is dawning and the last attack is coming....


ORDERS: 

TAKE ALL VH's


NOTE: 
This is a fictive scenario.


ADVICE FROM YOUR OLDEST SERGEANT:
-You absolutely should keep some pp to refresh your troops during battle 
-furthermore it would be a good idea to built ports at different places.
-Our cavalry should flank our attack at the right and the left side
-We can count on marines and later on infantry and cavalry support
-Furthermore the slaves from the confederate farms are only waiting to be freed to join our troops..
