Herr General,

I am glad to hear that you have reshuffeled your positions in order to close the gap in our front. It now runs along an imaginairy line from Serafimovitch to Nizhne Chirskaya and so far, it looks alright with remains of the 1st Roumanian Pz supporting Axis troops holding the southern part. 

We have however indications from General Richthofen that large formations, probably the Soviet first guard corps are on their way east to your sector. So, be on your guard against an attack from the east as well as a renewed attack from the north !
