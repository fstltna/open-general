Excellent! We were evidently right to give you the command of the Africa Corps.

Now you just need to push the British hard, don't let them regroup, and conquer back all the terrain the Italians have lost during that last month.

Then we might start the conquest of Egypt, seriously this time. You now have the troops, and despite the eastern front opening and our unexpected involvment in Greece, we will keep you supplied as well as possible.
