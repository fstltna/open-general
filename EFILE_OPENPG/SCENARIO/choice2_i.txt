England now lies open to invasion, ensuring total victory on the western front. The invasion is planned to occur on September 1st, but a debate at the highest level of government is in progress. Some believe that we should invade Spain in order to take Gibraltar and thus free the Italian Navy to assist us against the powerful British Navy. Others believe this to be unnecessary and they are winning the argument. Your opinion could influence the outcome of this key decision. The assistance of the Italian Fleet could be the difference in the upcoming invasion, but it may come at the cost of some of your prestige.

Do you want to spend 300 prestige to secure Gibralter and the help of the Italian Navy?
