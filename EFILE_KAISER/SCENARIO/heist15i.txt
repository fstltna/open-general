Battle of Cesis
June 22, 1919

Kindralmajor, there have been some disturbing developments in Latvia.  The Latvian Army had a slow start in organization in 1918, which resulted in the nationalist Latvian government's request for foreign intervention against the Red Army.  German volunteer troops-the "Baltishe Landeswehr" under the command of General Von der Goltz-have been waging a ruthless terror campaign against the Bolsheviks, which has spilled out against the local population.  Goltz, however, refuses to cooperate with the Latvian government and is now threatening to destabilize the country politically.  The Latvians have called upon us to help them at this time of need.

Our III/1st regiment and the Kuperjanow Brigade have taken defensive positions around the airfield near Vaidavas, while your Soomusrongide Diviis elements are to be deployed around Valmiera.  The Latvian garrisons in the area have been wiped out, but the Latvians are sending two understrengthened brigades, which will arrive within days from the south-west.  The Freikorps are expecting to destroy our forces in parts:  they have filled the gap between Vaidavas and Valmiera with an unknown number of troops...

NOTE:  In this scenario the German troops are side 2--which is the Bolshevik side.  Unfortunately, there are only two sides the game will allow, so please imagine that the German troops are not really Bolsheviks...
