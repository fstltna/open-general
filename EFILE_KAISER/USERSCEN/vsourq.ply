La Bataille de L'Ourcq - Monthyon

September 5, 1914

After the battle of Le Cateau, Von Marwitz - commander of II Kavallerie Korps - sends his three cavalry divisions in pursuit of the retreating BEF. On the morning of September 1st, when the fog clears, the 4th Kavallerie Division finds itself eye to eye with the BEF's 1st Cavalry Brigade and the order to attack is given. The 1st Brigade has spent the night in and around Nery far away from other BEF or French forces and finds itself heavily outnumbered against the attacking Germans.

Further East, Von Marwitz's five Jaeger battalions and the mounted troops of IV Korps attack the BEF's 5th Division rear-guard 13th Brigade at Crepy en Valois.

Von Kluck has sent the bulk of the First Armee SE in pursuit of the French Fifth Armee - ignoring the city of Paris and the new French Sixth Armee defending it.  Our 4th Kavallerie Division and IV Reserve Korps are now the sole units covering the flank of our offensive into France.

General Gallieni - gouverneur militaire de Paris - recognizes the unique opportunity to seriously disrupt our advance and moves General Manoury's complete Sixth Armee out of Paris to strike our flank. The North of the French counterattack does not meet any resistance, but your scouts have spotted the advance units of General Lamaze's V Group de Divisions de Reserve which is about to clash with IV Reserve Korps. The battle of the Marne is about to start here along the river l'Ourq at Monthyon.
