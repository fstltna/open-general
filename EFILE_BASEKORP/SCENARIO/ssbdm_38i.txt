    "They just don't stop coming" 
  SS Frau General Ingrid Whallen talking to Frau Generals Pedderson and Gerwitzhaus. "Where Stalin gets these I don't know.We got piles laying all over the place.They stink enough when their alive but let the Bastards lay there in the Sun a few Days and the Stench will make You sick.I told the Fuhress to forget the Replacements just send Tons of Perfume.I know when the Wars over I aint living in this Land called Russia or whatever the Fuhress renames it,You'll never get the stench of the rotting Corpses out.But back to Business.They cut through the Lines and captured Luga destroying the Fuel.So now We got to move there and take it back.I got enough Fuel for that and the way I understand the Reports they had little armor,it was mostly infantry and horses.They did have those trucks with Rockets in good numbers.I know the Girls don't enjoy that sound or the aftermath,that's a Dam formidable weapon almost brings as much fear as the Flame-throwers.But we'll take it back it just 'burns Me to the Core' that once again something We payed for in Blood will cost more.I'm wondering if We will ever have a secure position here in this God-forsaken Land.So that's the situation,We move in an Hour".
