Kimberley

March 5th, 1900

For nearly five months our troops have besieged Kimberley to no avail. I have to admit that the British commander, Lt Col Kekewich, is an excellent officer. In fact I feel sorry for him. Every day he has to direct the defence of this mining town, and still worse, he has to suffer Cecil Rhodes' presence.That must be like living in Hell.

Taking Kimberley is important for us strategically speaking, but its symbolic importance is even greater. This is the place where Rhodes, one of the worst enemies of our country, founded De Beers with the help of the Rothschilds. Capturing Rhodes and the mines would be an immense humiliation for the imperialists and their policies.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.
- Your MSU must survive.

Special note:
- A brigade of Irish miners has been added to your core.
