Finally, we took Lesboeufs and Morval. The breakthrough was very close this time, when the Germans did a last, desperate effort, and it slipped out of our hands.

Tactically speaking, the Somme was another failure. Our advances were minimal, with hundreds of thousands casualties. But strategically, it was a great success. France was saved, and Germany was so weakened that, just a few months after the battle ended, its Army had to retire 40 miles, to the safety of the Hindenburg Line. I know that many orphans, widows and parents who lost their sons at the Somme will never find consolation in strategy, but for me it is important to acknowledge that, although we all paid a terrible price, our brave soldiers gave their lives for a reason and that their sacrifice was an unavoidable step towards our final victory. 

The pain for the loss of William still tears me apart, but that has never led me to reject his act of heroism. I feel sorry for many contemporary young men who condemn a war in which they did not fight, allegedly for humanitarism. They fail to understand that, in doing so, they are spitting on the graves of the very same soldiers who they claim to honour.
