Herr General, the Poles have pushed us back from Caen and are still on the offensive. The SS troops must hold until we can get your troops to reinforce them . This will take 5 days.
When your reinforcements have arrived you must retake Caen and push the Poles back and retake all the coastal  hexes, these are the important sites.
