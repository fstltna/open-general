Cambrai - deutschen Gegenangriff - November 30, 1917

After initial success, the British offensive at Cambrai has stalled. We are ready for a counterattack. The primary goal is to surround and destroy multiple British divisions. The secondary goal is to take command of the lost positions of the Siegfriedstellung.

Take command of Gruppe Arras, attacking from the North-West. Gruppe Caudry will attack in the center and - the largely off-map - Gruppe Busigny from the South-West.

Player orders:
- Destroy 50 British Must-Survive units to win.
- Capture the three British flagged hexes in the South for extra rewards.
