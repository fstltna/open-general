
FAID - 30 JAN 1943

You have been transferred south to the Faid Pass; an important pass in the Eastern Dorsal range and an obvious objective for any Axis attack. 

On January 18 the Axis launch Operation Eilboete, with the objective of capturing passes in the Eastern Dorsal range. The offensive has mixed results, but does capture the Fondouk Pass. Many French garrison units, guarding the passes, are decimated and their positions are only partly saved by British and US reinforcements. Your men are away from the main action, guarding the southern part of the line. After less than 10 days the German offensive ends.

On the night of January 30 German forces enter the Faid Pass and you request orders from HQ. You are ordered to hold your positions on the hills around the pass and south of Sidi Bou Zid; and counterattack if possible. US reinforcements are on the way, but they are slow - maybe too slow to save your men...

GOAL: Take all VH's!
