STORY

In the second week of May 1928, the NRA began to move north out of its bridgehead on the north bank of the Yellow River. Despite having been deprived of the use of the Tientsin-P’u-k’ou Railroad and thereby being forced to make a sixty-mile march, Ch’en T’iao-yüan of the First CA took Tehchou on May 13. Having cleared northernmost Shantung of the Ankuochün, the First CA could now combine with Feng on the North China Plain in a common front facing Peking - still nearly 200 miles distant. In the northwest, Yen Hsi-shan’s Third CA was in place to make up the left wing of the front, which arced around from the Yellow River all the way to the Great Wall near Peking.

Yen’s Third CA had been fighting the Ankuochün since early in April when Chang Tso-lin tried to take on Shansi before the NRA arrived in the north. In mid-April in the rugged Shansi mountains that overhung the railroad to T’aiyüan, Yen’s capital, Chang’s offensive had been blocked. In northernmost Shansi, Chang had pressed deeply inside the ancient Great Wall, taking first Ta-t’ung and then Shuochou. On May 8, Yen was finally able to mount a counteroffensive, which retook Shuochou and pushed Chang’s Ankuochün back out of northern Shansi. By May 25, the eastern point of the counterattack along the railroad connecting T’aiyüan with the North China Plain pushed the Ankuochün down out of the Shansi highlands. As Yen’s Third CA descended to the plain, there were on that ancient battle ground nearly one million troops - more than half of which sided with Nanking.

Down on the plain, Feng followed the Peking-Hankow Railroad while Yen’s forces paralleled the route north through the highlands bordering Shansi. Both converged on Paoting, which they besieged. There, again, on the North China Plain was an example of what unified action could accomplish - however fleeting was that unity. In his attack from northernmost Shansi, Yen threatened the side gate to Peking and forced Chang Tso-lin to divide the Ankuochün defensive force. While the Ankuochün held on tenaciously at Paoting in the south, Chang-chia-k’ou, the strategic gateway of caravans and armies to Peking, fell to Yen on May 25, followed a day later by Nan-k’ou, the last mountain pass defending the route to Peking. Yens contribution was, thus, quite valuable and placed him first in line to enter Peking.
