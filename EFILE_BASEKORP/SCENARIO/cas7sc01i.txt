You know what he's talking about of course - the Sudetendeutschen. About three million Germans live in Czechoslovakia and Hitler thinks now is the time to invade. He's a lunatic - the Wehrmacht is not ready. We can only hope to win if we achieve total surprise and smother resistance before it erupts. Thus your orders are to proceed to your victory objectives as quickly as possibe before the enemy has time to mobilise his army. The only organised resistance will probably come from one of the border fortresses.
