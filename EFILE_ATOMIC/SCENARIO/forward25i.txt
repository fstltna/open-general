Battle of Silesia
Herr General, meanwhile our armies have arrived Poland. You should take Krakow, west of you which is hold by the 4th Tank Army.
Your troops:
You will only have your tank army for this mission.
Enemy troops:
The 4th tank army has far under strength, but they have some serious Panther and Tiger II tanks. The strongest resistance should be in the Krakow city areal.
Please remember:
The next scenario (and Berlin too) will be no-auto-refit scenarios.
Sgn. Major Heinz
