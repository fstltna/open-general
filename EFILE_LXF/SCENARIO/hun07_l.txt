Soviet forces, overwhelming in numbers and equipment, began an offensive on January 13, 1943. The Red Army was totally successful: they rapidly destroyed the Hungarian 2nd Army near Svoboda on the Don River. An attack on the German 2nd Army further north threatened to bring about an encirclement of that army as well, though it managed to withdraw and was forced to retreat.

The losses of the Hungarian 2nd Army were enormous. Of an initial force of 200,000 Hungarian soldiers about 140,000 were dead or taken prisoners of war. Only about 60,000 men (half of them wounded) returned to Hungary in May 1943. 80-100% of heavy equipment was lost.
