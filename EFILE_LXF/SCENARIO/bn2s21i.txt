Lebanon, Near East
CO General Vittorio Ambrosio

General, the Suez Canal is in our hand and your troops are close to Beirut! You will lead the final attack on these important city! A German corps is already on the way to Syria to cut off the Allies supply. I hope this operation will force the Allies to surrender in the Near East! Finish your job, General!
