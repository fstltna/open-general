01/10/1940   Behind Enemy Lines

Let's go, Majuri!
Thanks to your work my boys were able to prepare these starting points.
Situation report: Since you have driven the Soviets out of this sector I have a special assignment for you. You shall infiltrate the Soviet lines and loot their supply depots.
Enemy: If you're fast, the woods are yours alone...
Our forces: Take the fastest and most powerful units of your group.

Take what the backs and sleds of your men can carry.  
Remember: Speed is everything. A complete victory won't be easy to achieve, but it won't matter. Mainly it's all about looting as many depots as possible. Everything you loot will be used for your troops.
