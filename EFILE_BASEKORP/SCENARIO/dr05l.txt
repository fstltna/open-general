Fall Rot - Operation Kleiner Baer at Altkirch June1940 L

Fortunately your failure here did not influence the outcome of this campaign. France surrenders! We accomplished in 6 weeks what could not be done in 4 years 25 years earlier. German troops will parade on the Champs Elysees. 
Because of your earlier performance you can keep your command. You even get control over the complete SS-V Division - Standarte Der Fuehrer, Standarte Deutschland, Standarte Germania and their supporting units.
