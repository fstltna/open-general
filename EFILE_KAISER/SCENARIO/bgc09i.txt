Chunuk Bair - 10/08/1915
--------------------------------------------------
General, our breakout has run into difficulties! We are still holding the summit of Chunuk Bair, but we had to relieve the Wellington battalion which has suffered heavy casualties while defending Chunuk Bair, and replace those brave New Zealanders by two inexperienced New Army battalions. At Hill Q, the Gurkhas have been driven off the hill and are waiting for reinforcements at the slopes. Your troops are ordered to retake Hill Q by a determined assault as well as hold our positions at Chunuk Bair. The enemy is sending further regiments to the front line, and will have plenty of artillery available. We will try to give you as much fire support as possible, but don't expect too much.

Good luck, General!
