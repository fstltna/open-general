General,

We have excellent news! After hearing of our victory in the Battle of Manila Rear Admiral Camara's Reserve Squadron has been sent to the Philippines.

Together with two of our most powerful warships, the battleship Pelayo and the brand-new armoured cruiser Emperador Carlos V, several transports are carrying 5.000 men and other supplies to reinforce our forces already in the Philippines.

Your orders are to destroy Dewey's squadron, to retake Cavite Arsenal and to force the Americans to surrender or to re-embark.

Victory conditions: to take all VH by turn 18 for a BV, by turn 20 for a V and by turn 22 for a TV. 

Paqueo,
