Let me introduce your precious core troops. They are all fast units, because this is a race!

Not only have you to cover quite some ground to capture all the VHs before the allotted time ends, but also your own VHs are on the other side of the map and only defended by a couple weak units. The enemy knows this, and if he captures your VHs it's quite literally "Game over"...

So, run for it: Capture as many towns you can afford to, and go defend your own capital before attacking the enemy's one.

Note there are two Bonus Bunkers (TM) on this map: You do not have to capture them to win, they are very strong (way too strong for your rookie units), but if you *do* capture them, they'll give you 200 points of prestige *each* and there is no cap!... They can almost double your gains. Do you feel lucky?...
