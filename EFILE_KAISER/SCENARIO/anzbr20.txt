Brief to Anzac Commander.

General Foch has declared this day "Tout le monde a la bataille"- "Everyone into the Battle" Your Anzacs are to join in this offensive with the objective of breaking through the Hindenburg Line and seizing several key enemy positions. Success here could force the Germans into signing an Armistace.
