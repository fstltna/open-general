Do you pledge?

July 9th, 1917

On November 5th, 1916 the German and Austrian Emperors granted independence for the Kingdom of Poland. 
The catch was that they needed more Polish soldiers. But according to international law, they could not conscript subjects of the Tsar. Only volunteers could be asked to fight against the Tsar and Russia. And all volunteers have been in the Polish Legions already. So to get the Polish conscripts, the Emperors had to grant independence for the Kingdom of Poland. 
But once the independence was granted, there was no need for the Poles to fight on the side of the Central Powers anymore. 

In July, Polish soldiers had to pledge their allegiance to the Emperors. Józef Pi³sudski asked his soldiers not to do this.

And what is your decision?

If you agree and pledge, you will gain more military experience in the ranks of Polska Si³a Zbrojna - Army of the Kingdom of Poland.
(Brilliant/decisive victory leads to the 2 battles in the 1918, then to the battle of Wilno in 1919. Free tactical bomber will be given.) 

You can refuse, abandon the troops and become part of the conspiracy called Polska Organizacja Wojskowa.
(Regular victory leads to the one short encounter in 1918, then to the battle of Wilno in 1919. Free tactical bomber will be given.) 

You can refuse and go to the POW camp together with your soldiers. There you will take care of them, and wait for the fall of both Empires.
(Tactical victory leads straight to 1919, the battle of Wilno will be played in 2 scenarios.  Free fighter will be given instead of tactical bomber.)

Intelligence report: Whatever will be the choice, infantry should be modernized to match the German Army standards.

Good Luck!
