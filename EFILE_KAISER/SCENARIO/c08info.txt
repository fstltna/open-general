BATTLE OF KOMAROW (29 August 1920)

I have some bad news, comrade.  A few days ago while you were busy trying to capture Lwow; the Polish imperialists started a counteroffensive pushing through the center of the line between Lwow and Warsaw.  After their breakthrough they turned north and now the entire northern command is retreating in order not to be encircled!  Our dreams of capturing Warsaw have to be shelved!

Your cavalry is needed north!  If you sweep northwards and cut into the right flank of the Polish offensive we might again turn the tide and Poland will be liberated from their reactionary capitalists!

The Poles have been able to form some kind of defensive line while you were pulling back from the Lwow operation.  However, this is no reason to be worried.  I am talking about the Cavalry Army!  It has not been defeated for months and just saying the name strikes terror into the enemy!  Strike north, and join up with our people's army in the north!!!
