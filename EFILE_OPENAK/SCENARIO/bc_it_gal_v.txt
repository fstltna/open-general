VICTORY

Impressive commander!  Despite the odds being stacked against you, you managed to hold the Italians off.  However, due to the very serious danger of encirclement posed by other Italian units on our flanks, the order to evacuate Somaliland has been given.  We'll regroup, drink some tea, and then come back later to give the fascists a bloody good licking!
