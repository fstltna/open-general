February, 17., 1864  Charleston


Dear Friend,
We have been on board of the ship for a week now. Most of us are sea-sick. We were sailing along the coast from New York City to the south. 
There are rumors about our destination.... Is it Savannah or Wilmington? Charleston or Mobile? The officers dont't tell us no matter how often we ask. I hope next time when I write a letter I will stand on solid ground....


ORDERS:
Charleston is a important confederate port and one of the largest cities in the CSA. Taking Charleston will be vital for us and would weaken the confederates. You and your corps have been selected to carry out an amphibious landing operation. Some of our troops have already taken position in the southern swamps.

ADVICE FROM YOUR OLDEST SERGEANT:
Sir, it seems it is not necessary to take all of the forts and batteries. Most of them are protected by immobile units. Sir, we also hear rumors about sea monsters!

NOTE:
This is a ("half-") fictive scenario!

There were many battles in the Charleston area, but the Union was not able to take possession of the city before 18th February 1865.
