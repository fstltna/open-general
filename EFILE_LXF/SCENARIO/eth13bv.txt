BRILLANT VICTORY

Ten thousand feet above sea level, bounded on all sides by steep mountains, cold and invigorating, Menz covered 850 square miles of upland plateau.

The fighting was hand-to-hand and many were killed on both sides, but it was inconclusive.

By December the exhausted Italian troops had been withdrawn from Menz. It was said later that there was hardly a stone village in Menz where the Eritreans or the "bande" had passed that had not been plundered and as far as possible destroyed.
