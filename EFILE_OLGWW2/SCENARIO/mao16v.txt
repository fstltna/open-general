VICTORY

Ahh, comrade Commander!  Do you like Khabarovsk?  It's a pretty city, isn't it?   I know you are the greatest hero of the PRC and the KRC and I have a mission for you from the Kremlin.  I have to give you a letter from Moscow but... well anyway this is a good situation to do it.  Err... yes, but first, let's negotiate the surrender of my forces in this sector.
