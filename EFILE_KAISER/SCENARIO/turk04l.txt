Battle of Kirk Kilisse - Loss

You fought valiantly, but the Bulgarian Army finally overcame your troops. We'll have to retreat to our defences at the Çatalca line. I hope you'll do it better there.

Historical outcome
Kirk Kilisse was an outstanding victory for Bulgaria. Although initially well planned, the Ottoman counterattack was poorly executed, giving the Bulgarian 3rd Army time for deploying its reserves and launching a frontal attack on the Turkish lines. After some heavy fighting the Ottomans were defeated and fled the battlefield, leaving much of their equipment to the victorious Bulgarians.
