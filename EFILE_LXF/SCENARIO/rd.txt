1946-54 RED DESTINY
Soviet Campaign

In 1924, Adolf Hitler is assassinated by a fanatical German communist. The Weimar Republic never collapses, and the Second World War never occurs. Europe enjoys two decades of peace.  However, without Hitler to check his expansion to the west, Stalin is unchallenged.  The Red Army begins it's march to the Atlantic on March 20, 1946, threatened only by a European Alliance of Britain, France and the fragile Weimar Germany.  Lead the glorious armies of mother Russia to victory!
