BATTLE OF MAI CEU

March 31st, 1936 (Central Highlands, Tigray Province, Northern Ethiopia)

Thus by mid-March the north of Ethiopia was in Italian hands. Italian columns were moving out in all directions.

The emperor of Ethiopia had decided to lead his own troops into battle. Badoglio's wireless messengers intercepted the message. He immediately cancelled the orders for his proposed advance, and disposed his forces to await the Imperial attack.

For this decisive action Badoglio had called up his best troops. On the Ethiopian side could be found most of the greatest names of the Empire.  It was fitting that the great battle of the war should be fought not between subordinates but between the Marshal of the Italian armies and the Emperor himself.  Both the Emperor and Badoglio must have realized that the impending battle would decide the fate of an Empire, and neither of them could have wished it otherwise.

Above all morale was high in the Ethiopian camp because the Emperor was with them and because they were going on the attack. 

The Italians knowing in advance of the attack had time to FORTIFY THEIR POSITIONS, put up thorn "zeriba" hedges, site their guns, and bring up by pack mules with all the supplies they needed from their motor-transport base. They knew not only that an attack was imminent but almost certainly when it was coming. The radio messages of the Ethiopians had been intercepted.
