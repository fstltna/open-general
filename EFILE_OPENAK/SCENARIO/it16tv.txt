TOBRUK - GEN. KLOPPER'S DEFENCE June 1942 TV

Congratulations with your victory. The lack of anti-tank guns in Tobruk's garrison, the abscence of the RAF and the fact that the inexperienced South African General Klopper clearly expected an attack from the West lead to an easy push through the perimeter's defences. 

Only the fall of Singapore - earlier this year February - is a bigger humilation for the Brits than the capitulation of Tobruk. Next to 35000 prisoners, we got our hands on much needed supplies.
