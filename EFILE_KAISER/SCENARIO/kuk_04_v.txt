Perfect. Most of the Serbian army has been destroyed, and the survivors are fleeing to the south. They will try to reach the sea through Montenegro or Albania, but don't worry about that for now. Our reserves, as well as the winter weather, will take care of them. Now your troops must rest and recover until we need them again.

In the end, this has been a very good year. At last we've avenged the Archduke and restored the honour of the Empire. In the east the Russians are retreating, ad so far we're resisting the Italian assaults in the west. Let's hope that 1916 is even better.
