The miracle of Belebei. I still call it that way. I truly believe that God helped us in that terrible battle. Because not only did we defeat the Bolsheviks. Our victory was so complete, so fast, that a huge gap opened in the enemy lines, and our units quickly marched through it, outflanking and destroying all the communist regiments that they could find. We could even allow ourselves to send reinforces to other areas where our army desperately needed them. 

Before the end of May, we had crushed the Soviet counterattack and we had a new chance to reach the Volga. But then we learnt thar our enemies were regrouping near Chistopol, on the left shore of the Kama. If the communists consolidated that position our chances to recover Kazan would be gone. Since we had already dealt with a similar situation in Belebei, Kolchak sent us to liberate Chistopol.
