00. PEARL RIDGE 1 (29 November 1944)

Greetings, General! The Australian government has been asked to take over the defense of and operations on the island of Bougainville, an important island almost 300 miles east of Rabaul and 500 miles north-east of New Guinea. The XIV United States Corps is currently making the final steps to its embarkment from the island. On 22 November Australian II Corps has taken over command of Allied forces on Boungainville.  The bulk of the Australian forces on the island will consist of the Australian 3rd Division. 

The situation on Boungainville divides the frontline into three sectors. The northern and southern fronts, and the central front; all centered around the main base of Torokina.

The first action of Australian troops on Bougainville will be carried out by 9th Battalion of 7th Brigade which is deployed in the central sector in the mountains north of Torokina where the Numa Numa trail connects Torokina with Numa Numa on the other side of the island. In an attempt to outflank enemy positions on a ridge known as Pearl Ridge, you will assault and occupy two hills known as Little George Hill and Artillery Hill. 

Enemy dispositions are only generally known. Although the US XIV Corps has held out against a huge Japanese offensive in March this year, we still expect the Japanese to have more than 25,000 troops on the island. Good luck, General!

NOTE: All core units and all the units you can buy will be a strength 6. This is to reflect the company scale level of the campaign.
