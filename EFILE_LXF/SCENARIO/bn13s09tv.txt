TACTICAL VICTORY

Excellent! You have stopped the Germans! However south of Gembloux, at the center of the front in the West the Germans have crossed the Meuse River in force. A giant gap of 80 km from Dinant to Sedan exists. As we speak, the enemy is pouring in troops. You have orders to retreat west.
