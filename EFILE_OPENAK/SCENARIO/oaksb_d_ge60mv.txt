Herr General,  you narrowly accomplished what was expected of you.  Unfortunately, the Soviets held the Volokolamsk Highway long enough for more troops to arrive.  In addition, heavy snows are now falling.  Our offensive cannot continue under these conditions. Herr General, you are not suited to command at this level.  You will report to the officer training school at Metz. There is an opening for a panzer maintenance instructor.
