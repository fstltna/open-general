Herr General: As you know, the Fuhrer has decided to divide our forces. Armee Group A and the 4th Panzer Armee are now rushing towards the Caucasus, leaving Armee Group B, (containing only your 6th Armee), to drive on towards the Volga river. General Halder is speaking to the Fuhrer about this; he has concerns that a grave strategical blunder has been made! Nevertheless, you will continue on towards the Volga river, and on the way, attempt to secure the resources of the Donets basin...
