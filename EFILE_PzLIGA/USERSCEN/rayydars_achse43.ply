Case 'Axis':
Italien 43 - basierend auf historischen Gegebenheiten, aber in der Ausgestaltung fiktiv.

Good day, General!
Since the Duce lost control we are afraid that our previous Ally will defect to the enemy.
Therefore you need to quickly disarm all Italian units in your reach and take over all key positions from them.
Any resistance has to be broken with any means.

Due to the strained situation on the Eastern front we only can spare 1 Panzer-, 1 PzGren.- und 1 Fallschirmjaeger-Div. for your mission. Additionally, you absolutely must liberate our Gebirgsjaegerdiv. from their cut-off position deep in deep in enemy territory.

Italian naval units ran out of La Spezia and, along with Allied air forces, are suspected to oppose you as well!

Best of luck! 
Kesselring, OB Sued

Buongiorno, Signore Generale!
Mussolinis removal gives us the opportunity to end this ill-advised war. We are holding armistice talks with the Allies as we speak.

However, I am afraid the Tedeschi will not let this happen without action and will attack us. In that case we have to put up one last heroic defense.

Particularly the Gebirgsjaeger, who are a thorn in our side, definitely have to be annihilated. Also, our air strip has to be held at all cost, to enable possible Allied air support.

Tanti auguri!
Mareciallo Badoglio
