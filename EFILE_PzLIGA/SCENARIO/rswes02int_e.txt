Battle of the Tenaru

August, 1942

Konnichiwa general.  As you know, since the 7th of August, the Solomon Islands, Northwards to Australia, are under attack by the US Naval troops.  They have landed on the North side of the island of Guadalcanal, the main island, taking the airstrip, which they are using to support their air forces, and to receive supplies too.  The island of Florida and Tulagi are also now occupied by enemy forces.  Intelligence thinks that the US Navy will soon send reinforcements to their beach head around the village of Tenaru on North Guadalcanal.

Your mission is not easy general.  You should deploy a detachment to the East of Guadalcanal, where the Ichiki Detachment is already deployed and attack the enemy beach head as soon as possible.  They should be kicked out from the Solomon's!  Wakarimasu-ka?  To support your mission, there is already a detachment from the Special Navy Landing Forces in the West, while the Imperial Navy will send an entire fleet plus some air units to strike the enemy warships...
