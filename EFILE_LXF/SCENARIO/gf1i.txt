Engagement off Lofoten - April 9th, 1940

Vizeadmiral, the Kriegsmarine only got a small role in the invasion of Poland. But now the Wehrmacht requires our help. Ten destroyers will land 1,900 Gebirgsjäger of the 139th Gebirgsjägerregiment of the 3rd Gebirgsjägerdivision commanded by General Eduard Dietl in Narvik.

Your orders are to prevent British ships that were sighted to the north-west to interfere with the landing in Narvik. You will operate together with the battleships Scharnhorst and Geneisenau. Make sure not to lose any capital ships in this operation.
