Manila

February 4th, 1899

Get ready, quick! Shots have been fired near Santa Mesa. I don't know the details, but apparently that the Filipinos have rebelled against us. 

I knew that it would happen sooner or later. When we arrived at the Philippines I really believed that the only thing that the local population wished was to get rid of the Spaniards and that, once they were gone, the Filipinos wouldn't object to an American occupation. But I was wrong. They want to become an independent republic, and they want it now. Some weeks ago their so-called president, Aguinaldo, threatened us with war if we persisted with our policy of benevolent assimilation. 

In the last days the tension between our soldiers and the armed Filipinos that control much of the outskirts of Manila has grown enormously. It was just a matter of time before we had an actual battle, and now the time has come. We must restore order in Manila. Gather your troops and take care of this rebellion. 


Victory conditions:
- Take all the enemy VHs.
