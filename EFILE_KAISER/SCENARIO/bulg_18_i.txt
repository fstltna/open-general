Morava offensive - Nis

November 3rd, 1915

The war against Serbia has started extremely well. In the north, German and Austro-Hungarian troops have crushed the Serbian defences. In the South, our Second Army has nearly liberated all of Macedonia, and here, in the center, we destroyed the first Serbian line at Pirot, some days ago.
Now, you and your refreshment troops from our First Army must follow our offensive and take the town of Nis, where two Serbian divisions will desperately try to delay your advance. All our other forces are busy in other fronts, so you'll have to deal with the problem without expecting any reinforcements, Good luck!

Victory conditions: Take all VHs.

Special notes: Now you can buy trucks for some of your units. That may help you to advance faster.
