OPERATION EPSOM
June 26th, 1944

Poor weather has hindered our build up of troops and materials in the Normandy beachhead.  Furthermore, the Germans have been able to move an entire SS Panzer Corps completely unhindered to the front, thanks again to bad weather grounding our aircraft.  From our intelligence interceptions, we can deduce that the Germans are planning to use these reinforcements in a counter-offensive.  Therefore, we must forestall them with a new attack of our own.  This operation, devised by Montgomery, is looking to outflank the defenders of Caen by crossing both the River Odon and River Orne southwest of the city.
