The Hungarian word literally means “Headquarter Infantry”.

It is a Combat Support Infantry with weak attack and defense values but very high initiative. It has three special skills: it doesn't surrender because of suppression, it lends its experience bar(s) to the adjacent friendly units, and it can use rail transport (RTP) and it can attack naval targets.

This is a fictional unit, however, the flag bearers and the officers fighting in the first lines had very significant role in boosting the morale of the exhausted troops, and they often turned the tide of the battles when the inexperienced Honvéds started to retreat after the first Austrian attack. The most famous and documented example was the Battle of Tápióbicske, when major Károly Földváry grabbed the fallen flag of the retreating troops and personally lead the counterattack accross the bridge.
