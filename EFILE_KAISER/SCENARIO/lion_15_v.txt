The old dream of Emperor Yohannes IV, my father and so many other Ethiopians finally became true. Ethiopia had its well-deserved access to the sea. Massawa and Assab were ours. In a few days, our troops took all of coastal Eritrea. Besides, before the end of the year, and after a quick war against the Mad Mullah, our troops conquered all of the Italian Somalia, too.

When the Great War ended, we were counted among Germany's friends. The Ethiopian Empire is now bigger than ever. We have ambitious plans for modernizing our country, and I hope that we'll accomplish them. It won't be easy. Traditionally, Ethiopia had been the land of two rival tribes, the Amharas and the Tigrayans. Now, the majority of the empire's population are Oromos, Somalis, or people from different tribes. Besides, most of the Tigrayans would rather live in their own, independent country, and their loyalty to the empress is questionable. Overcoming this tribal strife will be indispensable if Ethiopia is to become a prosperous country. May God guide us during these years of peace, as he guided us during the years of war.

The campaign is over. I hope you've liked it, and thanks for playing.
