SEOUL (25 June 1950)

Welcome, Comrade General, to this historic briefing.  Korea has been in the hands of foreign powers for far too long.  The Imperialist Japanese have been driven off our peninsula only to make room for capitalistic Americans - but only in the south.  The people of North Korea have the full support from our comrades in the Soviet Union.  They have supplied us with weapons, trucks, artillery, mortars, and their famous T-34 tanks!  Now the time has to come to unite Korea under the communist banner and free the people of South Korea from their capitalistic oppressors!!

From the border at the 38th Parellel, we will attack on a broad front.  You will be in charge of the operation directed at taking the capital of the South: Seoul.  Intelligence has made it clear that most South Korean divisions are deployed at or near the border.  A perfect opportunity to destroy them, don't you think?  The Southern army has little equipment, and they are lacking tanks, artillery and aircraft.

Comrade General, be careful with your equipment.  We have only limited stocks of tanks and artillery which means it will be very hard for us to replace any that are lost.  We will meet again in Seoul!
