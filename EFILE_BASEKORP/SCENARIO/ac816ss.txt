Come in General......close that door quickly!

General, Hitler insists that we push even harder to encircle Moscow!  How?  All our German formations are mere skeletons of what they should be!  This crazy cold winter is no excuse he says!  He is convinced the Russians are about to fall apart, I don't know what to think.  

We've had reports of Russian units fighting to the last man........and others that come wandering towards our lines on their own trying to surrender.

But, what choice do we have?  We must hit them with everything we can muster!  Go!  Prepare your men, YOU attack across the entire sector tomorrow! 

STAFF INTEL: Everything seems to favor the Russians, but 3 battle groups should be able to advance and achieve victory.  The Russians are defending in depth again - we must keep our units near full strength.
