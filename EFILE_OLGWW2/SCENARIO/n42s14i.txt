Herr General,

For a moment we succeeded in stopping the Soviets here, at the Lodz line. However, the Soviets have broken through north and south of you. 

Thus a pocket could soon be formed around your troops. You are to take your corps, brake out of Lodz and stop the Russians at the Warta river, which will be or next temporary line of defense before the Posen line. By the way: It would be wise to move along the railroad to Sieradz because the Russians from the northern pincer may soon swing around Lodz.
