
AMIENS III - 7 JUN 1940

The new frontline, fortified by the hastily build Weygand Line, runs from the Channel coast at Abbeville, along the Somme and Aisne River to the Maginot Line. The Germans have started the second phase of their attack on France after destroying our forces at Dunkirk. 

On all other sectors of the front, there seem to be no large attacks thusfar, only at the Somme sector. Hold the line... as long as possible: prevent a German breakthrough. The French Army is not what is used to be, and the German Army is perhaps the best formation in Europe...

GOAL: Hold 3/2/1 VH's for a BV/V/TV!
