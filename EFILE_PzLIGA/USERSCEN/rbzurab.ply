Bzura Break-Out v.1.1

Following to a Polish counterattack across the Bzura River, the Germans moved large parts of their 10th Army to counter the Poles and abandonned their attack on Warsaw. General Kutrzeba wants to hold the Germans on the east and south banks of the Bzura River and at the same time breakthrough in the north, towards the Kampinoski forest. If the Poles can reach these northern objectives and continue to hold their positions on the Bzura, despite the concentrations of German armour, then they can move through the Kampinoski forest - which is too dense for German armour - and reinforce Warsaw.
The Germans have amassed a great force, though, and the Polish troops need determination, discipline and a strong will to fight to achieve this.
