
NICE - 21 JUN 1940

Somehow you and your men have made it to the Alps! Italy has declared war on France, in our time of need. The Army of the Alps, with less than 6 divisions ready and smaller Maginot Line, will resist the jackal Italy which is estimated to throw more than 30 divisions into battle. In the rest of France, the Germans have crossed the Loire River and are in the vicinity of Dijon...

Your force is deployed at the southern sector of the front, near Nice and the Mediterranean Sea. You have orders to hold the frontline and repulse any Italian attack on France. Counterattack if possible. Good luck, mon General, save the honour of France! Vive la France!!!

GOAL: Take all VH's!
