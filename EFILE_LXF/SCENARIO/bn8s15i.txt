
LIBERATION OF MOSTAR - 6 Feb 1945

Sibenik, Croatia
CO General Petar Drapsin

Your Corps is selected for the liberation of Mostar! However, the Germans have already started to retreat inland. Advance with a task force as soon as possible on Visoko and with a second along the coast on Dubrovnik. This way we can surround and destroy the retreating Germans! The British have pledged support from sea and want to eliminate some German bases on the islands. This is your chance for revenge for the 'Battle of the Neretva River' in winter '43!

Take all VHs and prevent the escape of more then three enemy units via Exit Point!

The Soviet Union supported our fight for liberation extensive with weapons and ammunition. You are now able to provide you Corps with the most modern equipment!

THE STORY

The Mostar Operation was a series of Yugoslav Partisan military operations in Herzegovina from February 6-15, 1945.

Mostar guarded left flank for troops of German South-East Command and Army Group E retreating from Serbia and Montenegro through Sarajevo North along Bosna river to Slavonski Brod.

Most of central Herzegovina was part of the District of Hum in the Independent State of Croatia. Mostar was also home to an air field of the Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia.

Partisans took Siroki Brijeg on February 6 and Mostar without resistance on February 14.
