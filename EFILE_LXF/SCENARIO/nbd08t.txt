You managed a win, but your advance was much too slow. However, it did 
not slow down our British Allies. They have defeated the enemy at Mareth and 
the Afrika Korps has surrendered to Montgomery.  Now it appears that the US 
Army had very little to do with this victory. Monty is getting all the press and Ike 
is a very unhappy man.  Washington has chosen a very special mission for you . . .
