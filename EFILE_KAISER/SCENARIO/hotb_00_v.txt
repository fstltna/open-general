Wow, it has been a little tougher that we had though, hasn't it? Those Spaniards do know how to fight, and they've been able to retreat in order when they saw a chance.

I'm surprised that the defenders of Las Guásimas didn't receive any reinforcements from Santiago. We could have run into serious trouble if General Linares, the Spanish commander, had decided to help General Rubín, but it seems that Linares is too prudent, and he's afraid of a Cuban attack against Santiago if he sends any troops out of the town. Much better for us. After we take all the hills surrounding Santiago Linares will be trapped there, unable to defend himself, and he'll regret not having been bolder when he had the chance.
