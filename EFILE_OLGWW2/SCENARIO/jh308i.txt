Herr General, as you know the Americans landed in Northwest Afrika in November.  While Feldmarschall Rommell executed a fighting withdrawal against the British, though outnumbered 10 to 1, the American drive from the west has had little resistance.  It is imperative that the Allied drives be stopped. You must help Feldmarschall Rommel defeat the Allies. 
The High Command agreed reluctantly to your demand that all arrangements for the transportation of your troops to Tunesia be handled by direct courier, never by radio.  Our Enigma codes are unbreakable of course, but since Feldmarschall Rommel supported you in this we agreed. It is undoubtedly only coincidence that the convoy carrying you and your troops had no Allied interference.
