Epéhy- September, 1918 - V

Well done Herr Oberst. Thanks to the stuborn defence of you and your men, enough time has been gained to prepare the Hindenburg line. The Alpenkorps is taken out of the line and is sent to the Balkans where the skills of your men are urgently required. Our Bulgarian allies are under a lot of pressure from Serb, French ands English attacks. We need to keep them in this war.

Actions of the Alpenkorps in the Balkans consisted of constant fighting retreats. These less epic actions are not depicted in this campaign. So this is the end... my friend... Thank you for playing this campaign that the four of us made between September 2018 and December 2021. You are very welcome to post feedback on the Open General Forums (Designer's Corner section).
