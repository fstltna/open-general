   "Isn't It Enough"?  06/24/40
  "Rarrwwall",it's another Air-raid".London under the Bombs.Since mid April the SS/BdM had been visiting the Brit isle.The RAF flyers had held their own and actually had shot down 10 percent more than what they lost.But the RAF was exhausted, running out of Fuel and replacement parts. A quarter of their Airfields in ruins so now their actions had to be curtailed as the JU 88's roamed the English Skies delivering their payloads.Was it in the air or sea though as the 'Fuhress Class battleships in the Atlantic had brought the Convoys to 36 percent getting through. England was on starvation rations.Calls to America went unheard. American reporters,the Red Cross and World Clergy in England begged for action from America but what could Roosevelt do besides secretly sending American transports in the Convoys and then when sunk by the SS/KM Atlantic Fleet dominating the waters cover-up the loss of American lives.So London,under the Gun again.This time the Target the Food Storage centers.The RAF would do it's best and give it's all.Never in History had 'so few gave so much' Churchill stated.But It wasn't Enough.The SS/BdM Flyers as well a Organized force as the World had ever witnessed had the 'Edge.The People in London,crums to eat before and after June nothing.Calls would come from the Hungry to those in the Goverment "Isn't It Enough"!
