
EL ALAMEIN - 23 OCT 1942

Alam Naghil, south of El Alamein, Egypt

It is time to expel the Axis from Egypt! The offensive against the German-Italian positions at El Alamein has begun. Your troops have the task to attack the enemy positions east of Ruweisat Ridge and - if possible - to capture. The main attack will take place in the North and - in case of success -  force the entire German-Italian front to retreat!

GOAL: Take all VHs!

NOTE: A fighter squadron, trained and equipped by our British allies, is subject to your command. Congratulations!

STORY: Several thousand Greek soldiers ended up in Egypt, having accompanied Allied units evacuated from the mainland and from Crete. Others from the Evros Brigade crossed into Turkey when Greece collapsed and were given a choice of being sent home or to British-ruled Palestine; several thousand chose Palestine. Finally, a "Dodecanese Phalanx" of 600 exiles from the Italian-ruled islands of the eastern Aegean Sea had been forming under British sponsorship in Egypt. Together, these men became the "Royal Hellenic Army in the Middle East."

But many Greeks who wished to fight the Germans simply stayed home and did so as guerillas. The Greek partisan movement eventually grew to be very large, but split between several factions.

The 1st Greek Brigade began forming in Palestine just three weeks after the fall of Crete, with three infantry battalions, an artillery battalion and engineer and machine gun companies. Training proceeded slowly and political tensions between communists, royalists and republicans kept things tense. After a brief deployment to Syria, where Col. Pafsanios Katsotas took over and instilled more discipline, the brigade transferred to Egypt in August 1942. To replace them on garrison duties, a 2nd Brigade formed in late July.

Many of the most energetic officers and men chafed at garrison assignments, and volunteered for special duties. The Long Range Desert Group formed a Sacred Squadron that participated in covert actions, and in September the Greek special forces were expanded into the Sacred Battalion ("Ieros Lohos"). Col. Christodoules Tsigantes' unit (named for the ancient Theban elite) made raids in Libya, Tunisia and among the Aegean islands, racking up an impressive war record.

As with many other armies, the Greeks paid a price for drawing off their best troops into an elite unit. The loss of its best officers to the Sacred Battalion greatly reduced 1st Brigade's effectiveness and exacerbated political differences. Katsotas transferred Communist activists to the new 2nd Brigade, which became known as the "Red Brigade" and was rated as even less capable than its sister unit.

THE BATTLE

Following the defeat at the Battle of Gazala (June 1942), the 8th Army retreated from Mersa Matruh to the Alamein Line in Egypt, a 40 mile (60 km) gap between the town of El Alamein on the Mediterranean coast to the north and the Qattara Depression in the desert to the south.
On July 1, the Afrika korps attacked. On July 2 Rommel concentrated his forces north, with the intention to break the allied resistance & advance through El Alamein to Egypt.
Auchinleck counter-attacked on July 10 at Tel el Eisa.
On October 23, after the First Battle of El Alamein, which had stalled the Axis advance, the allied forces commenced a feint attack to the south, engaging the German 21st Panzer and Italian Ariete Division (both armoured divisions) & to the north, attempted to create a narrow pathway, through the German minefield, to help the allied armoured divisions advance. The Greek Brigade was stationed at Alam Naghil at the time, spread out in a long line of defensive posts (5.5 km-3.4 miles), opposite to the 20th Italian Regiment (Brescia Division) & two battalions of the German Fallschirmjäger (Oberleutnant Schweiger's II Battalion, Hauptmann Burckhardt's III Battalion). Since October 12, the Greek Brigade has been an active Unit of the 50th British Division.
