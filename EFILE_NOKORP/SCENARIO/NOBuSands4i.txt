You know the drill: Push the British hard, don't let them regroup, and conquer back all the terrain the Italians have lost during that last month. The port of Benghazi is vital for us, our logstic lines are way too long.

Some more troops have arrived for you, especially fighters you desperately need to counterbalance the lack of Italian air support. We also send you another repair unit given the amount of abuse your tanks are subjected to.



Instructions: Capture all VHs. You gain some more free core units.
