*** TILES VERSION ***
* 0 current stable version, hex_tiles_rand.png not used
* 1 same stable version but using hex_tiles_rand.png if also hex_tiles.cfg is present
* 2 new version using hex_tileset.png and hex_tileset.cfg
*
* version is set automatically depending the files found. Version 2 is set when engine finds hex_tileset.png
* otherwise version 0/1 is selected depending if hex_tiles.cfg can be loaded.


*** TILESET BACKGROUND ***
* terrain used as background for terrain not clear

* clear
bkg_ter = 0


*** HIDING ROADS ***
* define terrains that should be painted after (over) roads

* city, airfield, fort
draw_after_roads = 1, 2, 3, 11, 12
draw_after_shores=1, 2, 3, 4, 11, 7, 10, 13, 15, 18, 12
* noPort_Roads = 1 (disabled)
* noPort_Rails = 1 (disabled)


*** RANDOM DECORATIVES ***
* terrain will use a random image picked from hex_tiles_rand.png or hex_tileset.png (cols 7th to last instead of 1st)
* Note: when commented out all terrain will be painted using 1st col of hex_tileset.png

* clear, small town, sand, swamp, river, stream, impassable, shallow sea
rand_ter = 0, 1, 7, 8, 10, 13, 15, 18


*** DECORATIVES: LAST COLUMN PROBABILITY ***
* can define a lower probability to last random col when using rand_ter by defining
* If DiceRoll(1,100) < $last_rand_prob, them last column is picked
* else engine will pick a random column excluding last one

last_rand_prob = 4


*** DECORATIVES: ADJACENT HEX PROBABILITY ***
* Factor reducing probability to draw a random decorative for each adjacent hex having same terrain.
* If defined bigger than zero, then when:
* $rand_neighbor_factor x (adjacent same terrain hexes) > DiceRoll(1,100)
* then, first col will be drawn instead of C07... LastCol
* Sample: for rand_neighbor_factor=8, then probability to draw a "clear" surrounded by 6 "clear" terrain using first column instead of random would be 8*6 = 48%

rand_neighbor_factor = 7

*** DECORATIVES: ROADS ***
* can define that hexes having roads or rails won't use random tiles regardless on terrain using rand_ter

* .. sample 1 => hexes with roads will always use 1st col regardless it's included in rand_ter
norand_roads = 1

* .. sample 1 => hexes with rails will always use 1st col regardless it's included in rand_ter
norand_rails = 1


*** SIDES ***
* terrains using sides overlap

* city, airfield, forest, bocage, hill, mountain, sand, swamp, fort, escarpment, rough, custom
sides_ter = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 14, 16, 17


*** SIDES FOR DIFFERENT TERRAIN TYPES ***
* Allows a comma delimited list of terrain pairs joined by either : + (plus sign) or > (bigger than sign)
*  if '+' ... the pair is reversible. sides_inter_ter=5+6 means:
*    -- if hill has mountain adjacent (on side 1,2 or 3), engine will draw a hill-side towards the mountain side
*    -- if mountain has a hill adjacent (on side 1,2 or 3), engine will draw a mountain-side towards the hill side
*  if '>' ... the pair is a single condition. sides_inter_ter=6>5 means:
*    -- if mountain has a hill adjacent (on side 1,2 or 3), engine will draw a mountain-side towards the hill side
*    ... but hill won't draw a side toward mountains

* forest -> bocage, swamp, river, stream, impassable
* forest <-> hill, mountain
* bocage -> swamp, river, stream, impassable
* hill <-> mountain
* swamp -> river, stream, impassable
sides_inter_ter = 3>4, 3+5, 3+6, 3>8, 3>10, 3>13, 3>15, 4>8, 4>10, 4>13, 4>15, 5+6, 8>10, 8>13, 8>15


*** ADJACENCY ***
* terrains using adjacency
* terrain use hex_tileset.png cols 1st, 2nd and 3th according adjacency rule

* city, forest, mountain, fort
adjacent_ter = 1, 3, 6, 11

*** SHORES ***
* fake river shore
* it can be defined to set as: 0 to use 8th row of hex_layers.png or 1 to use hex_layers_shore.png
FakeRiverShore = 1
