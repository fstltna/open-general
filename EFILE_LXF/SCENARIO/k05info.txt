05. CRETE (20 May 1941)

TO: Kapitaen zur See
SUBJECT: Operation Merkur

---Western Europe is in German hands. Our Kriegsmarine controls ports from as far south as Bordeaux in France to Narvik in northern Norway. We can strike the British Home Fleet anytime and from any direction we desire. 

However in the Mediterranean, the Royal Navy still rules. The Italian Navy is not much of a threat to it. After the fall of Greece and Yugoslavia, the sole British base close the European mainland is Crete. The garrison of the island consists of Greek, British, Australian and New Zealand forces. Our invasion consists of an airborne wave followed by a seaborne invasion.

Earlier today fallschirmjaeger have landed near Maleme and are scattered in the area. They hold on to the airfield in the area and await reinforcements and support. Because your ships lie in the German home ports only the ground and air components of your flotilla can be used. The Italian Navy will do it best to support you. We demand you take control of all vital positions on the northwestern coast of Crete.---

NOTE: You will not be able to deploy naval units in this scenario. You can deploy ground units but you will have manually to embark them on the "Port Embarking Hexes" near your supplyhex.
