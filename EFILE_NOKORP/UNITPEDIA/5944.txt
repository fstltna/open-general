Also known as "Mörser Karl" ("Karl Mortar"), it is a self-propelled siege mortar. Don't let its railway gun silhouette fool you, the Karls had tracks and could move on their own (albeit slowly).
7 were built.
Initial versions had a caliber of 600 mm (Gerät 040), but in 1943 smaller caliber barrels (540 mm nevertheless) were issued to increase range (from 4-6 km to over 10 km). Not all seven Karls were converted to the Gerät 041 standard though.
