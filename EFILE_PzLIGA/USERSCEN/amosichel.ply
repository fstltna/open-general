AMONAS 'Sickle Cut'

"The armored column follows their lead tank and is always in the enviable position of having exposed flanks" (Heinz Guderian).
In WWII this statement never was more true than in the legendary "sickle cut", the penetration of German Panzer groups through the Ardennes.
This strategy developed by Erich v. Manstein enabled the Germans to bypass the heavily fortified Maginot Line and drive a wedge between the Allied forces in Belgium and France.

May 12, 1940:
With XLI. (Reinhardt) and XIX. Panzerkorps (Guderian) five Panzer divisions form the front line section between Montherme und Sedan to breach the relatively weak French lines.
Only at Sedan they meet stronger resistance.
Without regard to their open flanks the German panzers need to penetrate rapidly into the hinterland to prevent the Allies to the north and south of the spearhead to unite.

Numerically the Allied troops are about equal.
However, they neglect another Guderian doctrine: "Smash, don't splatter!" Their reserves were employed without coordination and consequently the German troops, with the support of their superior air forces, were able to destroy them.

Can you repeat Guderian's strategy or will you be rubbed out trying to defend against the numerous attacks in your flanks?
Or, as Allied commander, will you be able to avoid the historical mistakes and stop the attack with concentrated deployment of your forces, or even launch a successful counter offensive?
