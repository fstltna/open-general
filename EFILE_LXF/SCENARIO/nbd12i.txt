Commander, we have another assignment of great political importance. Our Russian ally, Stalin, has been complaining about our lack of action against the Germans on the continent. We have decided to send a unit to aid the Russians. You have been selected as our test unit. Do not let us down, Commander, you must prove that American forces are every bit as able as the Russians.

Assignment: The Germans have control of the city of Stalingrad. The Russians have planned an offensive to encircle the Germans within the city. Your forces will lead the southern wing of the encirclement. The troops you will be facing are Romanians. Good, but not as good as the Germans. You should be able to make short work of them.
