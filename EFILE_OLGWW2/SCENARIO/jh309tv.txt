A barely acceptable performance, Herr General.  Only the brilliant maneuvers of Fieldmarschall Rommel saved the situation.  He will now continue with the conquest of Egypt and the Suez Kanal. You and your men are to be transferred back to the Russian front, where things have not gone well. Fieldmarschall Paulus has been unable to break out of Stalingrad.  Worse, intelligence indicates that the Bolsheviks are planning a great offensive in the Kursk region.  The General Staff hopes that your failure at El Alamein was but a temporary departure from your previous excellent conduct and thus is giving you one more chance to prove yourself.
