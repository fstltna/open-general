TACTICS VICTORY

Good, sir.  Jerry sure made a bit of a ruckus in this sector, but we soon put a stop to that - thanks to your magnificent generalship, of course.  The commander of the U.S. 2nd Armoured Division sends his gratitude for your help, in the form of the largest collection of Charlie Chaplin films ever gathered.  Its all piled up outside your HQ.  Shall I use petrol to make it burn quicker, sir?
