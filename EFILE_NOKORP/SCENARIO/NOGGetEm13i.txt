Remember the huge and quite deadly "Nightmare" tanks? You just faced one in the last scenario, probably obliterated it without even noticing.

Well, they now have been upgraded to Mark II, and this fixes (among others) their biggest weakness, their vulnerability to air attacks. Now they've become little AA units all on their own. To celebrate this, you will face 18 of them in a featureless, flat landscape without any shelter (they'll be assisted by a handful of normal tanks, and some self-propelled artillery, and some self-propelled Flak too, just to keep things interesting).

Not all is bad though: You get a free fighter, since there will also be swarms of enemy ground attack planes in the air...

If you manage to defeat that setup, you'll be ready to face the "Big Boss".
All right, let's see how you handle this! One way or another, it will be a massacre...
