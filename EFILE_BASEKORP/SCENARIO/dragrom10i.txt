      Defence of Sevastopol - 26 April 1944
____________________________________

     The Crimean Offensive (8 April 1944 - 12 May 1944) was a series of offensives by the Red Army in the effort to liberate Crimea from the German Wehrmacht occupation. The Red Army's 4th Ukrainian Front engaged German 17. Armee of Army Group South, which consisted of German and Romanian formations, in an operation to liberate the Crimean peninsula. 
      Soviet landings across the Kerch Strait and in the north-eastern sector of the Crimea near Sivash at the end of 1943, together with an attack at the Perekop Isthmus forced 17. Armee back towards Sevastopol from 10 April 1944. The OKW intended to hold Sevastopol as a fortress, as the Red Army had done during the first battle for the Crimea in 1941/42. The rapid movement of the Red Army together with inadequate preparation of the defenses of Sevastopol made this impossible, and on 9 May 1944, not even one month after the start of the battle, Sevastopol fell.
