The remnants of the Afrika Korps and their Italian allies have fled Mareth and have made a last stand at Bizerte. They are still very powerful and have been giving the British troops in Tunis a tough time. We need you to mount an offensive aimed at crushing the Afrika Korps and capturing Bizerte. This will remove their last port on the African coast and they will be forced to surrender.
