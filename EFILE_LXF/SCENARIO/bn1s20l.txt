General Wilhelm List

Well, General! I understand you could not hold your bridgehead. Unfortunately we could also not secure the oil fields of Baku and the front line across the whole Caucasus is hopelessly overstretched. We must give up Batumi and withdraw our forces. You are being transferred to Greece to prepare for an operation in the Mediterranean area.
