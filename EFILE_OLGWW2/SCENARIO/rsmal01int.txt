Malaya - Singapore

December, 1941

After your great success at Hong Kong and Macao, the high command wants you to assault the Malayan peninsula.  The last British stronghold in Asia is just at the end of the Malayan peninsula, Singapore!  That city-fortress is still an important base for the Royal Navy, and a menace to our shipping along Asia.  The British have deployed Malayan, Indian and Australian troops to defend their positions; however, thanks to the ''collaboration'' of the king of Thailand... we will attack from our Thai bases striking the peninsula from the North.  We will then expect the surrender from the British Commander hahaha!

Navy warships will arrive to deal with the Royal Navy.  Good Luck and Banzai!!!!!
