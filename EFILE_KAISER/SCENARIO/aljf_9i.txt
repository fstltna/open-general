March, 23., 1862 Kernstown


Dear Friend,
now the time has come to draw our attack into enemy country...

I got command for our attack on Virginia...!


ORDERS:
TAKE ALL VH's

ADVICE FROM YOUR OLDEST SERGEANT:
you should purchase some additional artillery and/or cavalry.
(watch out: a cheaper artillery, but with support-Fire [no "s"] is a better desicion as a heavy artillery with NO support-fire)
maybe a modern MG would be a wise decision, too....
and dont forget to upgrade your units from time to time....
---   * - *   ---
at first, you should just hold the Kernstown-line, and take glasshouse in the west; then move with your glasshouse-group forward to Kernstown...then you can attack Kernstown from two sides...
DONT attack Kernstown just with one group trough the river... tha´ts suicide !
