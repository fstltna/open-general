Raid at Bukoba - June 21, 1915

The British command decided to destroy the German wireless station at the town of Bukoba. The raid was launched as an amphibious assault since Bukoba was located on the shore of Lake Victoria.

Victory conditions: You are outnumbered.  Your units must cover the retreat since part of your units are auxiliary Ruga-Ruga tribesmen with little military valor in battles against a modern army. 


To win you must retreat 6 units, but if the British take the northern VH before turn 4 they win.
