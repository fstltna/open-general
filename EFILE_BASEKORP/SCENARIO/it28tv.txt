DEFENDING THE MARETH LINE March 1943 TV

Congratulations, you stopped the attack of XXX Corps, spearheaded by the 50th (Northumbrian) Division. Operation Pugilist is a failure, even with most of our tanks operating against the US II Corps at El Guetar.

Unfortunately the 2nd New Zealand Division proved that the Mareth line can be bypassed: just a week later they did so in Operation Supercharge II. There was nothing left for us but to hastily retreat to the Akarit line. The Akarit line formes a better defensive position than the Mareth line, but our troops arrived there in great disarray which meant that 24 hours after 8th Army's attack on the position it had to be evacuated. 8th Army has now made contact with the Allied forces in North and Central Tunisia and Mussolini's Afrika Korps faith is doomed.
