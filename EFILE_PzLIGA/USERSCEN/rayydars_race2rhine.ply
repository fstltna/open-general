Race to the Rhine

G'day, General!
Now our brave troops are facing the Siegfried Line. An obstacle, no doubt, but I guess it is no more what it used to be in 1940. However I'm afraid the Krauts will slow us down there while attempting to save the lousy remnants of their mobile units behind the Rhine. That must not happen!

So while our Allies' infantry divisions will engage the Siegfried Line complement, use your 1st Armored Division in order to:
- break through as fast as possible,
- take an airstrip in order to provide massive air support,
- cut off any German who is moving eastward,
- try to gain a foothold at the east bank of the Rhine!

In case you aren't fast enough the Monty has promised a Canadian armored division which will heckle the Krauts from the north; however they may be short on fuel after a long trip.

Good luck!
General George S. Patton
===================================

Guten Tag, Herr General!
The situation at the Westwall is serious. Our troops are well entrenched, but I'm afraid they can't hold it for more than a couple of days. So I suggest to retreat behind the Rhine, a perfect natural obstacle - at least with our last armored division in this area, the 116th Panzerdivision.

The infantry won't be fast enough. Thus its primary task is to delay the Allied advance. However, we need some intact infantry units behind the Rhine as well! I leave this decision to you ...

More bad news: the 116th Panzers are nearly out of fuel. Nevertheless, don't waste them in Westwall engagements - try to bring them back to the heart of the Reich!

Viel Glueck!
Generalfeldmarschall Walter Model
