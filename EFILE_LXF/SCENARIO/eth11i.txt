ATTACK ON ADDIS ABABA

July 28th, 1936 (Salale District, Shoa Province, Ethiopia)

Early in July a council was held at the monastery of Debra Libanos presided over by Bishop Abba Petros. Aberra and Asfawossen Kassa now conceived the boldest project of the war: a combined counter-attack on the Italians and the recapture of Addis Ababa.

It was not a so fantastic and aberrant project as it might at first have appeared. If the Italians had captured Addis Ababa so easily, it was because as a city Addis Ababa was almost impossible to defend.  Lying as it did at the foot of the mountains, surrounded by eucalyptus forests and sprawling shapelessly over an enormous area.  This was especially true against an attacking army possessing artillery.

The Ethiopians NO LONGER POSSESSED ANY ARTILLERY. But the other disadvantages which had made any defense impossible for them now made it just as difficult for the Italians.

It was a bold plan, particularly for leaders who had no means of direct communication with each other except by messengers. Its success would depend on coordination, and timing; always difficult in the best planned military operations  This was never a strong point of the Ethiopians but more likely to be achieved now that there was a sprinkling of European-trained cadets in position of influence.
