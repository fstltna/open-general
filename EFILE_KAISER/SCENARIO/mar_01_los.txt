Conversation from General García Aldave's HQ:

General, this was a disaster! You have been defeated by an irregular army composed mainly of shepherds and farmers!  Now even Melilla is in danger after more than four centuries under Spanish rule.  We'll have to beg France for help and that means that we'll lose all of our territorial concessions in northern Morocco. It is obvious that you are incapable of commanding an army on a real battlefield. If there is a spark of honor in you, you will resign and ask for your retirement immediately.
