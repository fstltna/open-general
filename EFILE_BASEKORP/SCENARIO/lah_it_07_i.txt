We're finally going to see action in Operation Barbarossa.  13th Panzer Division is advancing on Dubno and we are going to act in support incase of any Russian counter-attacks.  I wouldnt worry much about the Soviets though, they seem to be in complete disarray.  For them to counter-attack is utterly proposterous!
