Great Leap Forward

Private Tovarich!  Nice to see you again.  It has been a while since our last meeting at Khabarovsk.  It was a shame to lose the battle against you, but now we can re-negotiate the conditions of the peace treaty.  This is Top Secret and I hope you have told no one of our plans.  As our men from the KGB have told you, we are ready to support you, if you finally decide to undertake a coup against Mao Zedong and his reformed communism.  It is literally destroying China.  We need to take China back to the right and true communist way.  We think you and your so-called ''Gang of Four'' are the perfect team to take down the Maoist system and that destructive plan named ''Great Leap Forward''.  That woman of your gang, ''Madame Mao'' can be very useful in the near future, when you will need to destroy the political image of Mao.

This is the plan we suggest; in the past month the units under your direct management have been deployed on the coast of the Sea of China in preparation for the Coup.   We are ready to support you by sea.  The Chinese navy will remain loyal to Mao, but it is not powerful enough to deal with a minor Soviet submarine unit.  After we secure the entire coast by taking Tanggu, you must launch the counterattack against the government loyalist units which surely will be sent to defeat our plans.  Take the Tanggu airfield as soon as possible as this will allow us to send you reinforcements by air.  Our planes will be painted with the PRC symbols.  You must avoid the Americans as we don't need any problems with them now.  The incident should be only between Chinese forces.

The last stand will be Beijing, this won't be easy, as you know, the best PLA units are deployed there.  The price maybe high, but it deserves a try.  You can become the new premier of the People's Republic of China!

Udachi tovarich!
