Amiens

Nov 27th, 1870

The French lost most of the strategic advantage that they had gradually obtained when the defenders of Metz finally surrendered on October 27. Marshall Bazaine, who had refused to recognize the new republican government, was seen as a traitor, but after a siege of more than two months he actually didn't have many options left. 

However, the French were convinced that, if Bazaine had resisted in Metz just another week, they would have had time to complete the creation of the new National Defence armies, they could have defeated the weak Prussian forces at the Loire region, and they could have lifted the siege of Paris. That was a really unlikely sequence of events, but the French really believed it could have happened. After the fall of Metz it had become just an impossible dream.

Instead, the Prussians were free to send tens of thousands of veteran soldiers from Metz to the west, reinforcing the German positions and allowing them to retake the initiative. Almost immediately, they planned new offensives against the French armies.

One of those Prussian attacks was directed against the town of Amiens, where the small but potentially dangerous French Army of the North had established an advanced position. The Prussian goal was to drive their enemies out of the area of Amiens, so that they would cease to be a threat to the besiegers of Paris.
