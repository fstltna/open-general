Dieppe

May 10th, 1919

Now that France is doomed the British just want to leave the Continent and go back to their island. Initially they planned to evacuate their soldiers through Dunkerque and Calais, but the same week that you took Reims our First Army stormed the part of the front defended by the Belgians, taking those two ports and forcing Belgium out of the war. So now the British plan is retreating in order to Dieppe and embarking there.

We don't really have the resources to prevent the British from leaving France, but we must make sure that they won't have the means to come back, and that they'll suffer as many casualties as we can inflict on them. So take Dieppe and cut the enemy's evacuation route before the majority of the British soldiers are safe at home. Part of our Hochseeflotte will help you in this mission.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.
