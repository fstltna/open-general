Those were terrible days, certainly among the worst that I lived, and in the end we were forced to retreat when the Germans nearly encircled our troops. We could not afford that risk, and on December 3rd Haig ordered a retirement from the Bourlon Hill-Marcoing salient. 

German audacity had caused our plan to fail again, but at least Cambrai proved that a surprise artillery-infantry attack supported by new methods and weapons could destroy even the strongest German line of defense. Our victory was closer than ever, and our enemies knew it. The Hindenburg Line would not resist our attacks much longer.
