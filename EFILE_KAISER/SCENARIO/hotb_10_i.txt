War at the Marne: the Entente counterattack

July 19th, 1918

The French are determined to retake all the land between Soissons and Reims that the Germans took during their failed Spring Offensive. Naturally, we're ready to help them. This will be the first of the many blows that we'll land on the Germans until they recover their senses and decide to surrender.

Our enemies still have a strong and motivated army, but don't worry. In the next days many fresh divisions will join our forces, including a large number of tanks. Use them wisely.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the enemy VHs.

Intelligence report:
- In the turns 2, 3 and 4 you'll receive 81 reinforcement units to help you against the Germans.

Special note:
- Original scenario by Spasteur de Mont Tonerre, adapted by Urica.
