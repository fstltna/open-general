06. VIENNA (13 April 1938)

The enemy has conquered most of Austria. The Nazi swines have got what they came for... 

But we will defend the pride of Austria and the Austrian Army! The Germans have encircled Vienna and demanded the surrender of the garrison, your force as well as the last loyal and intact forces of our Army. The answer has been negative. Man the positions and make a last stand, General!

FUER OESTERREICH!!!

NOTE: HOLD OUT FOR 10 TURNS, GOAL IS TO HOLD YOUR CORE UNITS ALIVE.
