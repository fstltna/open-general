China's decadence hasn't stopped. Torn apart by foreign countries, local warlords and revolutionaries, the Dragon still sleeps. I thought that I would see the rebirth of a great nation, but now I know that I'll die before that happens. However, I still hope that one day my grandchildren will be able to live the dream of the Awakening Dragon, the dream that caused their British ancestor to sacrifice everything for the nation that they belong to.
