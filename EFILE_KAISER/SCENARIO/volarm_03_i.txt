The liberation of Ekaterinodar

Aug 13th, 1918

My dearest Katya,

After the murder of the Royal Family our determination to destroy the Bolshevik scum is stronger than ever. Despite all our suffering and all our losses, Providence is guiding us. Just four months ago we had to retire from the Kuban, defeated, without a leader and virtually without hope. Now, in a matter of days, we'll liberate all this region.

Anatoly has become a full-grown man. He's been promoted to captain, and his audacity, cunning and bravery is starting to be acknowledged and feared by our enemies. Looking at him now I can't help but remember that frail baby who gave us so many worries. I'm amazed at how much he has changed. I'm so proud of him...and I know you'll be proud when you see him, too.

Your plans to move to the countryside, where life will be cheaper, seem like a great idea. It tears my heart to be unable to help you in the present situation, but you know that there is very little money that I can send you these days. Your cousins have been the most generous and I will have an eternal debt to them, but it wouldn't be fair to ask for their help once again. When this nightmare is over I hope that Russia will reward all our efforts. But right now we'll have to live in poverty. Just like when we married. Do you remember? Those were very happy days, even though dreams were the only thing we had plenty of (...)

Victory conditions: Take all the VHs.

Special notes:
- The unit that takes Elizabetinskaya will obtain a leader.
- The unit that takes Ekaterinodar (20,13) will obtain +120 exp.
