Bad news (do I ever bring good news lately?).
The Americans and the British have broken through the Italians' defenses at Medenine and are now at hard on our heels. The only thing protecting us from being overrun is the Mareth Line, a system of fortifications built by the French along the steep banks of Wadi Zigzaou.

You have to break the momentum of the Allies and prevent them from crossing the Mareth Line, else our position here will become untenable. To make matters worse, the constant rain of the last week had transformed the roads into mud rivers. Do your best.
