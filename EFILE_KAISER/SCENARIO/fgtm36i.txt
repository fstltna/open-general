Dilman-Urmia, May 15 1915
Gospodin General-Leitenant, you must push forward with your cavalry to capture the western bank of Lake Urmia.  You command Sharpandier's cavalry and the Azerbaijansky Otriad (Chernozubov).  The Ottoman Halil-Bei Corps by now has suffered the retreat from the Meliazgert-Tabriz line, followed by its rout at Van.

Reports indicate that an Armenian revolt is under way at Urmia: civillian refugees have taken to the road.  Speed is of essence, Gospodin General-Leitenant!  You must secure the city of Urmia and your right (western) flank.
