The bridgehead at Ryakhovo

October, 1st, 1916

We must admit that those Romanians are a skillful lot. Their 3rd Army has managed to cross the Dunav River at Ryahovo and has stablished a strong bridgehead behind the supply lines of our army in Dobrudzha. Now our entire Romanian offensive is at risk. Thank God that you and your veteran soldiers are in the area. Go for the Romanians and throw them back across the Dunav! There are some Austrian monitors at Ruse, near here, and they'll sail down the Dunav to help you as soon as possible.

Victory conditions: Tale all VHs.

Special note: On turn 6 you'll receive two Austrian ships as reinforcements, coming from the west.
