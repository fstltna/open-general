Cacarajicara
(30 April 1896)
v.1.0
The sunset of the Spanish Empire - The Spanish American War 1898

Comandante,

Following the rebels' victory over our forces in Maltiempo (Central Cuba) last December, the way for the invasion of the rich provinces of the west has been opened. Maceo has crossed our fortified lines ("trocha") and joined other insurgents' forces in western provinces (Havana and Pinar del Río). In the first months of 1896 the mambises have destroyed farms, sugar mills and cane fields and have prevented the production of sugar.

The Government has just named General Weyler governor with full powers to suppress the insurgency and restore political order and the sugar industry in Cuba..

General Weyler has started an active persecution of insurgent leader Maceo. Informants have told us that Maceo is hiding in the Cacarajicara Mountains, in Pinar del Río province, southwest of Havana. A strong column under Suarez Inclán will attack Cacarajicara from Bahía Honda.

You will support the main effort with your troops departing from Aguacate, southeast of Cacarajicara.

Victory conditions: to take all VHs by turn 10 for a BV, turn 12 for a V or turn 14 for a TV. Alternatively, to kill Maceo (MSU) by the same turns.

Warning: There are only four deployment hexes! New purchased units will have 5 as default strength.
