The Germans mobilized their reserves faster than we did, and, deprived of any proper support, we had to go back to the left bank of the Aisne. It was then when I was informed that my son Michael had been wounded in a skirmish soon after his division had crossed the Marne. However, I was relieved to know that it was nothing too serious, and that he would recover in just a few weeks.

At least our enemies' initial plan had gone astray and they were far from Paris, but they still constituted a formidable threat. Now it was clear to both sides that the last hope for a quick victory lay in lauching a successful flanking maneuver in Artois or Flanders.
