CRUSADER, THE AFTERMATH - GAZALA 41  December11 1941

After retreating from the Crusader battlefield, we have taken positions at the Gazala line. Until more reinforcements arrive at the front, the British 8th Army is still stronger than we are. Not unless there are signals that your troops are surrounded, you can retreat further West.

News: The last German thrust towards Moscow has been beaten back and the Russians have started counter-attacks at Rostov in the South and at Tula near Moscow.
Japan is starting to threaten Australia and New Zealand. Comando Supremo hopes this means some of the Commonwealth troops will leave North Africa soon.

Notes: 
- Only 7 gound units can be deployed of which only 2 can be towed units. 
- Hold at least 5 Victory hexes for a BV, 4 for a V and 3 for a TV.
