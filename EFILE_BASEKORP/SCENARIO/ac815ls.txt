Bad news from the front Il Duce.

The Axis forces under our General have been stopped cold.

Our commander, in a desperate attempt to get his forces to engage and destroy the Russian Heavy armor was killed and his tanks then lost heart and were routed.

The Romanian Troops showed signs of wavering and then completely faltered after this disaster.

I understand your doubts in Hitler's demand to send more troops and Marshall Graziani......but perhaps Adolf will now listen to our demands for joint tank development as a price?
