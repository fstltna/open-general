Goltz in Riga
July 3, 1919

Kindralmajor, following your victory at Cesis, Von der Goltz' troops began their retreat to Riga.  This is our last chance to stabilize the situation in favor of Latvia and strengthen the Estonian-Latvian relations.  If you fail to destroy the German troops, then foreign intervention will be inevitable, which may not be an advisable option for young republics like ours.

Your assault on the city will be staged from three directions.  To the north, your immediate task is to capture the rail depot of Peltes and to deploy your Soomusrong.  The city of Riga bristles with fortifications built over centuries and modernized during WWI by the Russians.  Carefully choose your axis of advance!  To the south and east you must use cunning maneuver to support your armored assault.  The Freikorps have reorganized outside of Cesis, and their retreating units can be a severe danger on the flanks of our troops.

NOTE:  In this scenario the German troops are side 2--which is the Bolshevik side.  Unfortunately, there are only two sides the game will allow, so please imagine that the German troops are not really Bolsheviks...
