Once again your resistance was strong, but there are just too many British troops and they have managed to take some of your positions. You must retreat to a new line of defence in the area surrounding Kahe. 


Historical aftermath: After three frontal assaults and hundreds of casualties, the 5th South African Regiment managed to take both hills. By then the night had already fallen and the British commander Brigadier General Tighe not knowing the location of his different units and fearing a counterattack ordered a withdrawal.  However, in the confusion of the night the Germans didn't notice this and by the time they discovered that the hills were clear it was too late to mount a counterattack, since most companies were already on their way to Kahe.  Thus, Von Lettow had to leave the region of Taveta and retreat to the Kahe railway station.
