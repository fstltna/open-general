Relief of Kholm (5 May 1942)
Second part of the "Blitzkrieg!" minicampaign.

In January 1942, German troops in Kholm were surrounded by Soviets. They held the city until saved from the pocket months later by a third and final relief attempt.

Units in Kholm still hold the pocket, but they are in a desperate situation. Airdropped supplies are running low, as many of the transport JU 52 planes were shot down by the enemy. You need to act quickly, and completely dismantle the enemy: destroy the Soviets east of the city, thus cutting their frontline units in Kholm and its vicinity severing their supply lines, and secure the eastern approaches so that a save evacuation is possible.

Soviet forces consist of two battlegroups. The main force holds the outer lines east of Kholm, and it is your task to destroy them and thus facilitate liberation of the pocket. These are formed of infantry with some light artillery and AA support. The second, smaller group is assaulting the town, and they are supported by light tanks and infantry guns. Destroy their rear before they overcome the defenders of Kholm.

Tip: Ther are enough planes already grounded, don't waste the air support needlessly.
