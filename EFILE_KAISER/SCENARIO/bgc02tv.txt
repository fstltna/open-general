Eventually, your troops broke through the Turkish lines. Unfortunately, we had to stop our offensive after the appearance of two new Turkish divisions. Now we have to dig in.

HISTORICAL OUTCOME:
General Hunter-Weston asked too much of his 29th Divison when he attacked at Krithia on April 28th. The Allied artillery barrage was meagre, and the troops were still exhausted from the landings. Nevertheless, some British troops actually reached the slopes of Achi Baba, but a strong Turkish counter-attack, that was only stopped by the guns of HMS Queen Elizabeth, pushed them back. The difficult terrain and the failure to co-ordinate the attack prevented success. The Allies withdrew, having sustained 3,000 casualties form the 14,000 engaged.
