The First World War - Spring Offensive - The River Matz Riposte - June 10th, 1918 - LOSS

Well,  mon Général, our counter-attack must be called a failure. But fortunately, the Germans are even more exhausted than we are and have called off their offensive. We must thank the Lord that the German A7V tanks were too few and too cumbersome to make any significant impact on the battlefield. I wonder what a German army could do with a proper tank force. We hopefully will never find out...
