
PONT-DU-FAHS II - 3 MAR 1943

The first assault on Tunis, Operation Vulcan, is not as successful as planned so a second offensive, Operation Strike, is set in motion for early May. Your part in the offensive is to capture Pont-du-Fahs and move towards the coast. You are facing the experienced Afrika Korps in your sector but the enemy is suspected to be weak and on the verge of surrender.

GOAL: Take all necessary VH's! Check out which VH's need to be captured and which can't be lost!
