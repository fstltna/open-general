The First World War - Assault at Artois - 17th, Dec. 1914

Ma chère Fabienne,

The "Race to the Sea" is over and both Armies have started do dig in, from Switzerland to the Belgian Coast.
When I speak with the other Generals, they all say that we should stay mobile. We should attack and throw the Boches out of our holy homeland. But I'm really not sure if it's as easy as it sounds.

The QG has ordered me and my brave men to the Area of Lens. There are rumours about a grand offensive.

Wish me luck. Eternally yours,

Jean-Babtiste.

ORDERS: Ahhh, Bonjour, Général Bertaux-Levillain, please take a seat. A Calvados or a Cognac?
General Foch has ordered us to attack on the whole northern front. So here are your orders: As you can see, the Heights of the Chappelle de Notre Dame de Loretto, in the west of Lens, are a very important strategical place: We must take them back!
Our Secret Service has reported that there are just bavarian Reserve Infantries defending them, but they are well entrenchend. At first you'll surround their position, and later you'll take the Loretto-Heights.
Good Luck, Général !

OBJECTIVES: Take all Victory hexes.
