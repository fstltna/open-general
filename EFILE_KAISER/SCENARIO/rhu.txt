NOTES:
 - The Armored Train Artillery is the jewel of the Hungarian Red Army. You must keep this unit alive during the whole campaign!
 - There is a 1 SP "trap" unit in each scenario to prevent a sudden victory by killing all enemy units. Please don't kill it if you discover its position.
 - Use the gathered PP on reinforcing your units (don't keep it, if you are near the cap), at the end of the scenarios they won't be refit automatically.
 - Units lose 20% of their actual experience when upgraded.
