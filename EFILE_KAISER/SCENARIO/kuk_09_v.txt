You may have saved the Empire today, General. The Russians are still advancing, but we've saved thousands of men and tons of equipment. Obviously, we had underestimated our enemies. Or, maybe, we had overestimated our own strength.

Now the High Command believes that we'll have time to build a solid defence line around the fortress of Premissel.  After seeing how Lemberg fell, I'm not so optimistic. It'll be better to build a second line on the Karpaten. It'll be easier to stop the Russians there. I hope I'm wrong, but I think that we'll need it.
