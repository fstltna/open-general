We have reached a critical juncture in our war in Russia. Many generals believe that we should divert your forces to assist Army Group South in its drive to capture Kiev. There does appear to be an opportunity to trap and destroy a large part of the Soviet Army in this area. Other generals believe we should ignore the south and instead send your forces driving directly toward Moscow as soon as supplies can be brought forward, in order to reach there before winter. They believe a move toward Kiev will delay the drive on Moscow and may cause us to fail at the city gates. It appears that high command is leaning toward a drive on Kiev. Your opinion on this matter could sway their decision toward Moscow, but it would surely cost you some of your prestige to voice your opinion regarding such a key decision.

Would you like to spend 300 of your prestige points to convince high command to allow you to avoid an attack on Kiev and instead continue your drive to Moscow?
