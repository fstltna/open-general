Citoyen General, you managed a victory again, but you could have done more in NDC’s opinion. The imperials have had a considerable defeat in this war, and our great forces are pushing them back everywhere toward the borders. Only the arriving relief force commanded by Simunich saved Schlik’s corps the complete disaster.
