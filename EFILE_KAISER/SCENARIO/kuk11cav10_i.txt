Haluziya 
(June 7, 1916)

The Russians are expected to launch an offensive any minute; however, we don't know when and where they will attack. You must secure your sector. We will send reinforcements if your lines are in danger of being overwhelmed.

ORDER: Keep your MSU alive and hold at least 2 VHs.

NOTES: 
- AI plays first.
- The enemy gets strong and permanent reinforcements.
- The High Command has approved the expansion of your forces to include an Air Defense detachment.
