02. BACHMATSJ (13 March 1918)

On 3 March 1918 the Bolsheviks signed the peace treaty of Brest-Litovsk which made an end to official hostilities between Russia and the Central Powers. However sporadic fighting continued for days. Russia gave away huge territories including the Ukraine. At the time of the armistice the Czech Legion was east of Kiev.

The Germans were close to reaching their new borders on the border of Russia and the Ukraine. German forces made rapid advances using the railways. A collision between German troops and the Czech Legion is about to take place near the village of Bachmatsj, between Kiev and Konotop. To avoid capture it might be needed to fight a way east. Soviet Red Army troops are in the same position and are also trying to flee east. Cooperation with the Communists could be useful to our cause.
