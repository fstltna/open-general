11. SUCHUMI (28 September 1942)

THe enemy's advance on the coastal road has been halted and that saves many Black Sea ports still in our hands free from an attack on one side. However the German advance has penetrated deep into the southern steppes and has reached the foot of the Caucasus mountain range. There units, mainly mountain trained troops, are trying to cross the Caucasus mountains and attack the Black Sea ports from behind. The fascists stand on less than 25 kilometers of Suchumi. You must make sure the fascist sees no chance in capturing Suchumi.

We have been unable to stop the enemy in the mountains, but we will when they go down and try to reach the coast. Your units must secure the port of Suchumi, the coastal road which is our single supplyline to the front near Novorissiysk, and secure essential positions. Good luck, comrade.
