USA - Mexico War 1846-47

In 1845, the Texan Republic (not recognized by Mexico, which still claimed it as part of its national territory) agreed to an offer of annexation by the U.S. Congress and became the 28th state in the Union. The newly elected U.S. President James K. Polk made a proposition to the Mexican government to purchase the disputed lands between the Nueces River and the Rio Grande river further south. When that offer was rejected, President Polk moved U.S. troops commanded by Major General Zachary Taylor further south into the disputed territory.

You will lead the American troops against Mexico.
