OPERATION CRUSADER November19 1941

Nothing much happened in the last 5 months, but right when we were ready to start a new attack on Tobruk, British armour has swung around our border garrisons. 

Our division (Ariete) and our Corps (XX) recon forces are stationed around Bir El Gubi to cover the planned attack on Tobruk. The rookie British 22th Armoured Brigade seems to be under the impression that they can whipe us from the battle field. It is your task to prove them wrong.

Notes: - The initial attack of the rest of the 7th Armoured division and its clashes with the DAK SE of Tobruk are left out of the scenario. All of these units will show up in the scenario a few days later with the strength they had left after the initial tank battles.
- The Germans renamed their 5th Leichte Division to 21Panzer Division and have swapped some units between 15Pz and 21Pz.
- The assumption is made that Tobruk has not fallen to your forces earlier.

ORDERS
- Capture all Victory hexes.
- Keep the DAK HQ unit alive. It enters the map in turn 10.
