Gospodin General-Leitenant, the Turkish positions - up to 5 layers deep around the town of Kop - have been breached by your brave troops!  In the face of devastating counter-attacks you have held the captured ground.  Unfortunately, the Ottomans have carefully prepared a counter-offensive of their own.  Our entire Meliazgert Operation has stalled:  your troops have been ordered to pull back toward the city of Alashkert.  Scouts report the Turks have fielded several fresh corps to break through at Alashkert.  Their objective remains Sarykamysh.
