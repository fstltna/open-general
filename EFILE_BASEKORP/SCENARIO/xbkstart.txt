German and Axis Campaign 1937-1941 maybe further sometime in the future.
You take command of Axis troops from the civil war in Spain, to the end of the WW2 conflict.
This is not a "blitzkrieg" campaign. Battles are hard and long.
There is much prestige in the three early Spain battles. Build a core of 30 odd units and gain experience for your long campaign to follow.
Auxillary units are sparse as this is designed as a "core" campaign.
Sometimes it is best to bypass the enemy instead of trying to destroy him.
Repair crews, saboteurs, mineclearers and At/Aty units are excellent fortification destroyers.

Germany is the main country but other Axis nations are support countries. 

This is an Open General campaign with many new ideas and concepts utilised.

I created this campaign using scenarios from other designers campaigns. I used scenarios that I liked and modified them to suit the campaign flow and OG features.
There are 19 scenarios and someday I might finish the campaign but I doubt it.
