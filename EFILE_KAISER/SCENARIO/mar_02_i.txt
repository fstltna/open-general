1913 El Raisuli's uprising (I): Resisting at Alcazarquivir

(Part of the Djebala campaign)

July, 7th, 1913

Message from General Fernández Silvestre's HQ:


General, welcome to Djebala, the western region of our protectorate in Morocco. Not long ago, the situation here was relatively calm. We  tried to forge an alliance with the most powerful local leader: Mulay Mohamed El Raisuli, "The Sultan of the mountains", a combination of feudal lord and bandit who is both admired and feared by the Berber tribesmen. At first, El Raisuli accepted the alliance. He saw our army as powerful enough to be helpful, but powerless enough not to be a menace.

However, the situation deteriorated with time. The legitimacy of our protectorate is based on the stabilization and the development of the country, in favor of the interests of the Sultan of Morocco. El Raisuli sees the growing influence of the Sultan's agents as a danger for his own power, and some months ago he rebelled against our administration.

Even though the main combats are taking place near the city of Tetuán, the friendly "kabilas" have reported that a large number of hostile Berbers have been seen near Alcazarquivir, a town located near the border with the French protectorate and the Atlantic coast. Move your troops there and repel any attack in case  the enemy tries to surprise us.


Victory conditions: Take all VHs.
