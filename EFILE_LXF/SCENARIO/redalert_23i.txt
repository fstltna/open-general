Commander, if we are to encircle Soviet troops successfully, we will need to cut their lines of supply. You will lead an attack from the west to capture important supply bridges. Deployment areas are limited, however several Combat Engineers have escaped from a Soviet camp to the south. A quick victory here will allow both our western and eastern forces to converge and eliminate the Soviet threat.
