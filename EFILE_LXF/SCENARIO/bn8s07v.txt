BACKGROUND

Case White (German: Fall Weiss), also known as the Fourth Enemy Offensive was a combined Axis strategic offensive launched against the Yugoslav Partisans throughout occupied Yugoslavia during World War II. It is one of the most significant confrontations of the Yugoslav Front. The offensive took place in early 1943, between 20 January and mid-to-late March 1943.

The operation is most remembered in Yugoslavia for its final phase, the Battle of the Neretva in Jablanica, named after the Neretva river. The final phase is also known as the Battle for the Wounded.

In late 1942, with the Axis situation in North Africa deteriorating, the German high command became concerned about the possibility of an Allied landing in the Balkans. This was of particular concern due to the substantial resources they were extracting from Yugoslavia, including timber, copper and bauxite. In the event of an Allied landing, resistance forces in Yugoslavia would be likely to interfere with German defensive operations as well as continued resource extraction. As a result, on 16 December 1942, Adolf Hitler ordered the Armed Forces Commander in South-East Europe, Generaloberst Alexander Löhr to crush the resistance in Yugoslavia. In a meeting of 18-19 December, the General Staff of the Wehrmacht decided on the destruction of the Bihac Republic. On 8 January, Löhr and Mario Roatta, commander of the 2nd Italian army, met in Zagreb and devised a detailed plan.
