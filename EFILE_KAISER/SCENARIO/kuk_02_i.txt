The nightmare of Kolubara

Dec 3rd, 1914

General, get ready. Soon! I wish that this was just a bad dream, but if the reports are true, the entire Serbian front is in danger.

Don't you believe it? I find it hard to believe it myself, even after reading all those damned reports. We were doing it right, General. After the battle of Cer, we all agreed to take as few risks as possible. Our advance into Serbia was slow, methodical and, apparently, successful. We took thousands of prisoners and tons of equipment. Only two days ago, Belgrad fell without a fight. Yesterday we had a victory parade through the streets of the capital. We all believed that Serbia was doomed.

Well, we were wrong. While we were celebrating our victory in Belgrad, the Serbian army was regrouping and preparing a counterattack against our centre and our right flank. They knew that we had provisionally reinforced our left flank to secure Belgrad, and that our front was over-extended, so if they pressed hard enough our centre could fall.

It's incredible. They've attacked at the worst possible moment for us, and they're succeeding. Our 6th Army is on the brink of defeat, and I'm afraid that it will be on the retreat soon. 

Right now, the Serbians are manoeuvring to their right, trying to separate us from the remnants of the 6th Army. Our only hope is to regroup, resist their assaults, and try to damage the Serbian flank. That way we could give the 6th Army the time it needs for an orderly retreat, and we could mitigate this disaster.

Victory conditions:
- After 12 turns you must hold 7 VHs for a BV, 6 VHs for a V and 4 VHs for a TV.
