Line on Bug

Part 4/4 of the "Blitzkrieg" minicampaign.


The brigade rode right into the enemy defense! The line is strengthened by machine guns and they have an artillery and tank support. I don't know if the Soviets are already in the area, but I can tell you for sure that it will be us, not them, who will welcome the others. Do you understand? I need your tankists to breach the Polish line immediatelly! 


Victory conditions: Capture all VHs.
