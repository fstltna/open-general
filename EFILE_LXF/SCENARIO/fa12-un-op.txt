Let me immediately come to the point, Majuri!
Situation report: My border guards and the local militias were only able to slow down the advancing Soviets. The enemy has been spotted as close as 15 kilometers from Kuhmo.
Enemy: The 155th Rifle division is advancing slowly at Lieksa and is fairly weak. The 54th on the other hand is a good division and General Gusevski is no fool. It won't be a piece of cake to encircle him.
Our forces: Parts of your group plus the 9th Division, which is coming down from Suomussalmi. You'll work together with Siilasvuo. I don't want to see any dispute about competence!

Stop Gusevski and drive the Russians back across the border. I see you have quite a huge pile of material left over from the last raid. You'll for sure need this in later missions!
