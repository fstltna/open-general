Crying souls: The Ice March (I)

January 4th, 1920

Our problems grew with each passing day. Behind us, the Red Army was approaching. In front of us we had to deal with continuous mutinies, desertions and attacks from the partisans. We had lost our communications with the remnants of our First and Third armies. Tomsk and other towns had been lost. In fact, we only controlled the ground that we stepped on.

Kappel allowed everyone who wished to go home, or to surrender, to do so. Thus, we kept only the most reliable fighters. Then he planned to go to the Baikal, hoping that we could continue our resistance there. But first we'd have to reach Krasnoyarsk. We wouldn't find any friends there. A few days before the commander of our garrison in that town, General Zinevich, and the governor of the Yenisei province, had betrayed us and had started to negotiate an armistice with the Bolsheviks. One of our own generals! Can you imagine that?

Zinevich tried to persuade Kappel to negotiate with the communists, too. Naturally, Kappel refused, and decided to attack Krasnoyarsk. Zinevich would pay for what he had done, and we'd get supplies that we desperately needed.
