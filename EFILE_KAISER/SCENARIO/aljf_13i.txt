Dear Friend, we are sitting in the middle of nowhere, waiting for the enemy. They are somewhere in the woods. This region is called "The Wilderness", and that's how it looks here: Deep forests and small creeks.... 

ORDERS:
We have lost contact to the enemy armies! It is unclear what will happen and your orders are to keep position.

ADVICE FROM YOUR OLDEST SERGEANT:
Hold the line !!!
