April 23rd, 1954
Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico

You are not going to like this.

The fucking Commies are here too.  They've been wondering why we suddenly took such a huge interest in an insignificant little part of Mexico and they've dispatched their own equivalent of Anomalous Operations to the Yucatan.

That's not the bad part.

According to the Red commander, the Nazis apparently have some kind of rocket research facility in the core of the jungle.  They know we're coming, and they're preparing to sabotage the entire facility.  We NEED to have those rockets intact, Commander.  They could provide a huge benefit to our space program and our missile capabilities, especially if we get some scientists out of the deal.

Unfortunately, if we want to make it there in time, this means we will need to work with the Soviets.

The rocket base is split in two.  The Soviets will take the northern facility if you take the southern facility.

Work fast, Commander.

Carter out.
