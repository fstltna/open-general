Battle of Britain

Orders:

Before we invade Great Britain we need to get air superiority. To weaken the allies you have to destroy 15 enemy fighters and/or important facilities such as fuel depots, factories and radar stations. Take care, the RAF gets help from experienced polish pilots!

Note:

The Airfields in the ocean simulate flight path / approach corridors for planes taking off in France.

Historical Info:

The Battle of Britain took place between 10 July and 21 October 1940. It included large-scale air battles, actions against coastal-shipping and ports, bombing operations, both tactical and terror bombing. The german Luftwaffe, later asissted by Corpo Aereo Italiano tried to gain air superiority and to destroy the whole Royal Air Force. Once the Luftwaffe would have won air superiority, a invasion of the UK would follow - Operation Sealion. However, Luftwaffe failed to gain air superiority and lost nearly 2000 planes. Pilots from many countries served in the RAF or units under RAF command in the Battle of Britain. There were pilots from New Zealand, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Ireland, Australia, Belgium, South Africa, France, America, South Rhodesia and one each from Jamaica and Mandatory Palestine. The largest contingent of foreign pilotes came from Poland (145). While only 5% of all pilots who took part in the Battle of Britain for the RAF where polish, they claimed 13% of shot down german aircrafts. 

Large-scale night attacks, known as "The Blitz" continued until May 1941.
