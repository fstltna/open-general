Herr General,

We have a disastrous situation on our hands and where it not for you, sixth army would be all but finished now. East of Serafimovitch two Russian corps have broken through the Romanian lines, destroyed three Roumanian divisions, and routed three divisions of Sixth Army. South of Stalingrad the Roumanian fourth army has been annihalated. Though it still holds Kalach, sixth army is surrounded in a perimeter west of Stalingrad, and in a disastrous position. 

We now expect the Russians to poor in troops in order to march on the Chir, be ready for an attack from the east.
