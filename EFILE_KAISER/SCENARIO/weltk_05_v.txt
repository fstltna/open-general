Our lines have resisted. The British are going back to their starting positions. Loos will be remembered forever as a German defensive victory.
But, of course, there is a great problem with defensive victories: Sooner or later they'll end in our final defeat. Eventually the enemy will find the way to surprise us. We must act before that happens, but what can we do? We have numerical inferiority and the front line is too long. For us, attempting a breakthrough is out of the question. The OHL is thinking about a possible solution, and maybe next year we'll know their decision.
