Orders:

After the Salerno Landings the Germans were retreating. It seems they set up various defence lines between Naples and Rome. Now the first one, the Volturno Line, lies ahead of us. While the British 8th Army is approaching the defence lines along the Adriatic Sea, you and your men while approach the Volturno Line near the Volturno river mouth at the Tyrrhenian Sea. We expect a strong system of defences that will slow down our approach. 

Several German divisions have taken position ahead of you. They might carry out small scale counterattacks to disrupt our advance.

Note:

The 5th Army field hospital will supply your units and heal 4 strenth points in a turn.
