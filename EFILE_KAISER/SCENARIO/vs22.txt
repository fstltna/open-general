The Battle of Arras, Vimy Ridge - April 9, 1917

Hindenburg and Ludendorff have decided on a defensive strategy on the Western Front for 1917 and have pulled our troops back on the easier to defend Hindenburg Linie. The British and French public opinion is not pleased with the bloodshed at Verdun, Gallipoli and the Somme that did not result in any type of victory. British and French forces keep on searching for ways to brake the stalemate by trying to force a breakthrough. Their latest attempt is a simultaneous British attack near Arras and French attack on the Aisne.

You are in command of Gruppe Vimy that is holding the Vimy Ridge North of Arras. It has a commanding view over the area. In case of an - almost certain - enemy attack on your position, hold on to this valuable position for at least 2 days (6 turns) after which reinforcements can push the enemy back.


Player orders: Hold all 3 victory hexes at the end of the scenario for brilliant victory, 2 for victory, 1 for tactical victory and 0 for loss. Do not lose more than two batteries of the corps artillery and 73rd Reserve Division's artillery.
