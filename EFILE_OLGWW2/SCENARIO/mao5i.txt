Pingxingguan Pass

25-9-1937, Pingxingguan Pass, near Datong, Northern China.

As you know, we have signed an alliance with our former enemies, the nationalists.  Now, the enemy is the foreign imperialist invader, it's time to forget our quarrel with the KMT for a while.  We are united with them against a common enemy: the Japanese Empire.  While the KMT troops are dealing with the Japanese armies in other parts of China, our guerrillas have been surrounded by the enemy advance in Manchuria and other many places in Northern China, and you (yes, you), a veteran ChCP commander will show the dirty invaders a bit of the people's revolution power.  We must harass the Japanese rearguard as much as possible without taking too many losses.  I'm sure the current KMT-ChCP alliance will not long too much longer.

This is your duty commander; the 5th Japanese division is driving south towards the Pingxingguan Pass. You must block their path, and then, annihilate all the Japanese, using your famous guerrilla tactics.
