You won't believe it. The Russians do not take "no" for an answer, they are sending in more troops.
Unlike us, they seem to have an inexhaustible reserve of men and equipment.

Our hold on Moscow is not very solid yet, so you will have to prevent them at all cost from reaching the city. If they do, they might yet turn our victory into a defeat.

We don't know how strong this force is, but we expect it to be massive, so dig in and prepare to repel them. Failure is not an option.



Instructions: Capture and hold VHs. You get some additional core units.
