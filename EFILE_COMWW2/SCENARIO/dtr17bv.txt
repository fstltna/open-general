The Russians are dazed and reeling from the blows you and your brave men have delivered! Not only did you succeed in relieving and reinforcing Buda-Pest defensive positions, you drove the Reds back across the Danube. Herr General, diplomatic representatives of Germany and the Soviet Union are meeting even as we speak... Your string of victories here, and in the west, are unparalleled. You are to return home to a grateful nation.
