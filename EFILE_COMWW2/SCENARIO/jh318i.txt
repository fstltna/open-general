Herr Feldmarschall, thank God you are here.  Our situation is critical. Buda-Pest is besieged by the Bolsheviks. Your troops must force their way into the city. It is doubtful that our Hungarian allies will continue to fight if Buda-Pest falls. If you can drive the Reds into the Danube, we may stop the Russian Bear from consuming us.
