
BAKU - 28 NOV 1941

West of Baku, Caucasus

A major battle is imminent - your troops facing one of the ultimate objectives of the Eastern campaign! 4-5 Soviet divisions are encircled in Baku, Russia's oilfield, the largest city on the Caspian Sea and of the Caucasus region, and expect our attack. Unfortunately most oil production facilities have been destroyed by the Russians and the rebuild will take a long time, but primarily the supply of the enemy war industry with oil comes to stop. 70-80% of the Soviet demand was covered by Baku and is no longer available now. A blow that hopefully will be crucial for the further course of the war.
But the conquest of Baku will be no easy - the entrenched Russians have a strong air defense and will fight to the last breath!

GOAL: Take all VH's!
