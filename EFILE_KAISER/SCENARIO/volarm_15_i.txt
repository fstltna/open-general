Petrograd

Jan 26th, 1920

One last effort. That's all we need. When Petograd falls, all the Bolshevik power will have disappeared. Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin and most of their leaders have hidden here, waiting for a general mutiny among our forces, something that will never take place, or for the arrival of any ship that evacuates them to any country willing to accept them. And although I was reluctant to believe it, that might actually happen. The British and the French are so tired of war that they could allow them to stay in their countries. Well, if they want to hatch the eggs of vipers, I'm almost tempted to let them do so.
But I've learnt that revolution is like a hydra. No matter if we cut its heads, if we don't destroy them, soon many more will grow. So I must hurry and take Petrograd before they have time to  react. The fewer that can escape, the better.

Victory conditions: 
- Take all the VHs.
