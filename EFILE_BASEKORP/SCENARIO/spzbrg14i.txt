Russia

Part 3/3 of the "Ostfront" minicampaign



Herr General, meteorologists say that the snowfall won't cease not even after the New Year. 

General Bistroff, this is the turning point in the whole Russian campaign, and I hope you already understand this. We are on the brink of total collapse and the Soviets know this. 
We must immediatelly, without any delay, renew our offensive actions. We must shatter the whole Soviet line once again for the final time, break through it, destroy the enemy groupings and rush towards Moscow. This is the last blow, after which the Soviets will fall apart, but it must be dealt fast.


Victory conditions: After 15 turns hold six VHs for a BV, five for a V and four for a TV.

Hint: After we've broken through the initial defensive line, we must secure the area and hold the counterattack. Capture and hold the VHs... and then we may finally rush south towards Moscow.

Warning: Expect an extremely strong Soviet counterattack coming from the south. You'll do much better if you wait for the Soviets in prepared positions. Meet them in the open and you're in a serious trouble.
