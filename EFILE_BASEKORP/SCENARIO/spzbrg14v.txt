"We can't hold the line. Our forces are depleted  The brigade lost three quarters of its men and the remaining ones are exhausted, ill, hungry and badly equipped for the cruel weather. We've lost connection with the neighbouring units and it looks like these are routed or destroyed. Visible contact is not possible, strong snowfall continues for twelve hours now.

We're retreating.

Generalmajor Otto Bistroff."
