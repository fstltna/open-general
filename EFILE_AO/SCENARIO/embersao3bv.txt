--AFTER ACTION REPORT - 20 MAY 2053--

--EYES ONLY--
*Local forces in vicinity of Metro 12 have been destroyed or forced to retreat into the hillside.
*We have not seen this type of direct assault since late last year.
*We are unsure as to how the rebel forces were able to coordinate with such efficiency. 
*We suspect that the rebels may have used the last several months to rearm and revise their doctrines.
*Recommend increased security and vigilance across all sectors.
*Recommend detaching two armored battalions from Sectors 4 and 5 to lead an assault on Metro 12.
*More details to follow in subsequent report.
