The Filipinos are astonishingly brave, but obviously they have poor training and even poorer equipment. The uprising has been crushed and the survivors have fled to the jungle and the mountains. They intend to keep on fighting there. 

Winning this war will take some time, but we'll prevail. I'm starting to think that the Spaniards had so many problems with the Filipinos because they were too soft with them, but that won't happen to us. Most of the American generals that have come to this archipelago are veterans of the Indian wars. They know how to deal with stubborn native rebels that refuse to accept defeat.
