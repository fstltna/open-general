   "The Girls have got their step back"  04/08/42
  The SS Panzer Crews rushed to the Rail station.Finally the time had come,the Mark VI Tigers had arrived.Just a few and of course the 1st SS would be assigned most,still now instead of being better than Ivan they had the Equipment to put them on a Plateau where no Tanker had been before.Soviet Armor would be shot to pieces with the massive 88 and the SS Crews would be protected better with all the Armor thickness.The Frau's could stop dying and being maimed in the numbers they were while tangling with the Soviet massed attacks. SS Armor ratio was 1 SS tank lost to between 4 and 5 of Ivan.With a Tiger and the 88 it was thought it could reach 1 to 10,maybe even 15. A Tiger of course had to trade mobility and range of movement for that Awesome Gun and the Armor.Command was surprised that just the few Tigers arriving shot the Frau's morale up a 100 percent.The Doom and Gloom was replaced with now 'We can do it as it was in the first months of the attack on Russia'.And the Morale swept through not only the Panzer Crews but the infantry as well.With a Tiger around the Frau's could concentrate on the Ivan foot soldiers for the Ivan Armor was as good as destroyed.So the Frau's in their Tigers moved out."How about that kill ratio Helga"?
