Opatów
(October 23, 1914)

Our offensive has stalled. Two Russian armies are approaching. Your division has been chosen to relieve the KuK 1st Armee

ORDER: Keep your MSU alive and move it to Opatów.

NOTES:
- The best result you can get here is a TV. Austro-Hungarian auxes are commanded by AI.
- The High Command has approved the expansion of your forces to include an Infantry detachment.
