Herr General,

Thanks to your heroic resistance we were able to reach Kalach. We have started a huge evacuation of Stalingrad and initiated the retreat of the Caucasus army. 

1942 has been a bad year for our campaign. Clearly the Russians have suffered greater losses than we did, but we did not achieve the strategic victory we need. Where it not for you and your brave men however, we would have suffered a strategic defeat.

We have tranferred you to the quiet Italian part of the front. Your assignment is the same as you had with the Roumanians; providing them with the anti-tank capability they lack. We have sent the Italians lots of Bohler guns that are obsolete, but may be better than nothing.
