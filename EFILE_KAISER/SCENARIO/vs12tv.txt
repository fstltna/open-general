Antwerp - von Beseler's Mistake - September 4th 1914 - TV

It turned out that there was no second Belgian sortie from Antwerp. Our troops did however suffer heavy losses caused by shelling from a Belgian light armoured train and by the Belgian fortresses South of Antwerp that saw our troops move in range of their guns.

History
- [IXReserve] Corps (on your left) did not find Belgian troops in Dendermonde and torched the city.
- III.Btn/35.Res.Inf.Rgt. that was supposed to destroy the bridges ran into troops of the 3rd Chasseur a Pied Rgt. that was guarding the locks at the canal to allow the Belgians to inundate more territory around Antwerp.
 - 6.Reserve Division thought that the Belgian exit was in full swing to their East rather than the expected West. They turned North West to cut off the Belgians from their fortresses. This brought them in range of the guns of Fort Liezele and Fort Willebroek. Losses were heavy (600-800 men killed). The Germans reported to be lucky that the Belgian Army did not pursue their disorganized division.
