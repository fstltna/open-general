Third battle of Doiran

September 18th, 1918

Although you have defeated the French and Serbian armies, the British and the Greeks still threaten our left flank at the Doiran Lake. In fact, we know that five enemy divisions are about to make a general assault against our defences. If they overcome us, your recent victory at Dobro Pole will have been in vain, because we'll have to cancel  our advance into Solun and adopt, one more time, a defensive strategy. For God's sake, don't let that happen. Destroy the Brithish Salonika army and lead Bulgaria to victoy!

Victory conditions: Take all VHs.

Special note: With a TV or a loss, Bulgaria will ask for an armistice.
