04. Knights in the Sand (25 November 1941)

Tobruk is still under siege.  However, relief is on its way.  After two failed attempts, Operation Crusader is close to relieving Tobruk.  Between the Egyptian border at Halfaya Pass and Tobruk huge battles have and are taking place between British and German armored forces.  The situation is very confusing.

The garrison of Tobruk has been given orders to break out and join with the British 8th Army units coming from the south-east.  The Desert Rats of the British 7th Armored Division are closest to Tobruk.  The New Zealand 2nd Infantry Division will follow them after a slight delay. 

While most of the garrison will attack south and east along with the armored forces, your force will attack west, capture Acroma and advance towards Ghazala and Derna!
