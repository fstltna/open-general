Battle of Suomussalmi
[Important gameplay note below, please read.]

Abwehr Briefing: Clandestine military aid to Finland
(Geh.KdoS.)
...
Hauptmann, your unit will be masked as part of the Finns 9th Division defending the central region the country; this sector is of critical strategic importance to the Reich: should the Bolsheviks break through to Oulu they will not only cut Finland in half, but they will be in position in the future to attack all shipping within the Gulf of Bothnia and strike at the vital ore mining and export facilities just across the Finnish/Swedish frontier. 
...
Avail the Finns of your operational expertise, while also making a thorough assessment of Bolshevik military capability. You may engage in limited combat should that become absolutely necessary, but at all times remember: your first priority is to avoid capture or otherwise give away your presence. 

Good Luck! Hail victory!

[Note: For this mission your unit should be disguise your unit as Finnish (via the upgrade panel); doing so will cost you your transport, but the prestige to replace it will be provided at the end of the scenario.]
