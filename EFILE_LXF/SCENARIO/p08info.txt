08. CORSICA (1 October 1943)

The PEF has been chosen for a special mission. While our armies are invading Italy from the south onwards and are already at Naples, the strategic islands of Sardinia and Corsica still need to be captured from the Germans. The Italian government has switched sides and is now in the Allied camp. Most Italian units will either stop fighting or join the Allies - however some might still be loyal to the Germans.

The PEF, with a French brigade, will land at Corsica and liberate the island. The Germans have at least one SS brigade and components of a Panzergrenadier division on the island. There are signs of their evacuation. The Royal Navy will lend naval support and the USAAF will help with air support. It looks like the Friuli and Cremona divisions have turned against the Germans. They could help you in your conquest. Good luck, General!
