Comrade General, due to your exceptional performance in Berlin, the Party has asked you take a transfer to the Far East.  Here, China has been ravaged by an internal war for well over a decade.  Comrade Stalin is indignant at how far north their troops have been able to travel  Now is the time to strike.  Your forces must push over the border demarcation at Ulan-Ude, and retake as much land as possible from the invaders.  However, comrade General, do not underestimate the Chinese Army.  Although they are in a weakened state, they use some of the same purchased American equipment as the European Allies.  They may attempt to counter-attack.  Good luck, comrade General.
