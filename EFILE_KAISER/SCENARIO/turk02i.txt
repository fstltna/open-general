Battle of El Hani and Bu Meliana - October 23, 1911

I am glad to see that you made it to Trablusgarp (Lybia) to lead us into battle. It must have been a difficult journey from Istanbul disguised as a reporter. 

Unfortunately we had to move troops to Yemen last summer to fight a local uprising. Now we have no more than 3,500 Ottoman troops at our disposal in the whole of Trablusgarp and the Italians have landed at Trablus (Tripoli), Tobruk, Bingazi, Derne and Al Khums. They say that they want to "bring the blessings of progress to Lybia". Needles to say, that the Sublime Porte cannot give in to these Italian demands.

Here on the ground, the naval bombardment of the Trablus fortresses was so heavy that we quickly had to retreat from the city. The Italians have brought more troops on land and five Italian Regiments have established a defensive perimeter around the city.

Luckily the muslim tribal sheikhs have chosen our side. We have armed the tribesmen with some of the 25,000 Mauser riffles that we shipped into Trablus on the Derna  - only days before Italy declared war on September 29. And now we are ready to retake ownership of Trablus. Most of the troops are positioned to the South-East of Trablus, between the gardens and palm trees where the Italian ships cannot provide accurate fire support. 

Orders: Take Trablus from the Italians. End the scenario with six victory hexes for Brilliant Victory, five for Victory and four for Tactical Victory.

Intelligence report: The Italians will not be able to ship many new troops to Trablus the next few days. The Italian Navy still has a strong presence in the area.
