06. MERAUKE (25 June 1943)

STRATEGIC SITUATION:
Merauke is the last part of the Dutch East Indies not in Japanese hands. It lies on the south western coast of New Guinea and thus forming the extreme left wing of the Allied forces in south Pacific. Two strong Japanese divisions are stationed close to Merauke and Japanese air and naval control of the region cannot not be challenged. But we have your experienced force at Merauke as well as several other Allied components. The Japanese have conducted numerous bombing raids on Merauke and the last months the Japanese patrols are getting more and more agressive. We fear this is the prelude of a Japanese invasion of Merauke. You must prevent this with all costs.

TACTICAL ORDERS:
Japanese patrols from land, sea and air have turned their eyes on our look-outs in the region. With the loss of these positions we can no longer over-see this region and be losing control. It is of the highest importance that this is prevented. Your force must make sure this happens. You can make use of air and naval transport. 

NOTE: The Australian Commando unit is airborne and can be embarked into air transport at the airfield and be dropped anywhere above land. 

NOTE: There is sea transport available at Merauke Port which you can use to reach far away regions.
