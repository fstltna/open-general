Gospodin General-Major, the German right wing (III Cavalry and Posen Corps) were pushed back by our Galician veterans, the XIX Corps.  The XXV Reserve Corps was stopped with heavy losses by our V and sundry forces from the Lodz garrison (the baker company of the 3rd Leib-Guard Division participated in the counter-attack).

Dashing the German hopes of encircling our forces at Lodz, the German attackers found themselves at the risk of encirclement.  The Lovitch Group was the instrument tasked with completing this maneuver, but it was too weak in numbers to succeed.  The German 3rd Guard Division led the bulk of the enemy's forces out of encirclement.

Your action during this battle of maneuver showed the German command that taking large tactical risks may not be wise.
