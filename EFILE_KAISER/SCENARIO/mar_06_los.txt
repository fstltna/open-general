Abd el-Krim approaches to you, and starts speaking Spanish fluently, without an accent:

So, after capturing General Navarro we have taken another Spanish General prisoner! Allah be praised! You don't have to worry, we'll take you alive to Axdir. I know that your Government will pay a good ransom for you. You should feel lucky. Most of the Spanish soldiers will have the same fate as General Silvestre: They will rot under the sun or they will be eaten by the dogs. Now move!
