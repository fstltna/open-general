Liberation of Edirne - loss

Well, this is a minor disappoinment after all of your successes, but Bulgaria has surrendered anyway. You couldn't reconquer Edirne on the battlefield, but our diplomats will do it for you.

Historical outcome
During the second Balkan war, the Ottoman Empire recovered Eastern Thrace with little effort, taking advantage of Bulgaria being attacked by Serbia, Greece and Romania.
