I had expected more from you, Kapteeni!  
The 139th Rifle Division withdraw relatively intact. Somehow we will continue the fight here, but you have to expect more opposition now. The Russians won't be stopped by sausages and soup for a second time. 
Keep your troops on the alert. Decisive battles may happen over the next few days.
