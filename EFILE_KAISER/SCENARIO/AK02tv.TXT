Verdun - June, 1916 - TV

Quickly, your troops must entrench themselves. Immediately! Although Fort Vaux is under our control, the French are regrouping and will launch a counterattack soon. If they surprise you, you'll be lost. We'll need to do it better if we want our enemies to surrender before the end of the summer. And even if we get them to that point, if Britain and Russia lauch any offensives of their own, in support of their French allies, we'll be in serious trouble.

I'm sorry to inform you that you won't have any time to rest. You must keep on fighting until the battle is over. After that, there will be a new mission waiting for you.
