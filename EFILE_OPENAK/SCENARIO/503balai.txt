04. Balabonowka Pocket (23 January 1944)

The second half of last year was not good. We failed to deal a crushing blow to the Soviets at Kursk and we lost Kharkov and Kiev. And now the Soviets have crossed the Dnepr. We are outnumbered everywhere. Your sPzAbt 503 is flung together with other mobile units to form sPzRgt Bäke. 

Your first mission is to stop a Soviet offensive at the Balabonowka pocket. Two tank corps and a mechanized corps of the First Tank Army have broken through and are headed for Vinnitsa. Prevent them from taking the town and take Oratrow to isolate the enemy forces.
