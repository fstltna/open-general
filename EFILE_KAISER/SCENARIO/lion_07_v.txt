And so it was. Ethiopia became the only country from black Africa that resisted the European colonialists. The Italians lost more than 6,000 men at Adwa, and nearly 3,000 were captured. The survivors retreated to Eritrea, and never returned. We didn't pursue them. Our men were exhausted, and we couldn't demand more from them.

The Italians had had enough, too. In Rome, The Crispi Government fell. On 23 October 1896, Ethiopia and Italy signed the Treaty of Addis Ababa, and the war finally ended. The Treaty of Wuchale was abrogated, and Italy acknowledged Ethiopia as an independent country. A few months later, France and the British Empire did the same. However, we didn't obtain any territorial gains. It was obvious that Emperor Menelik didn't wish to fight for the sovereignty of Tigray.

It's been ten years since then. Now I'm an old man, adopted by the Ethiopian nobility. My sons and daughters are part of the Ethiopian aristocracy. Did you know that Daniel, my oldest son, fought at Adwa when he was only sixteen years old? Later, I sent him to the military academy of Toledo, in Spain. He was the first Ethiopian who graduated from a European officer school. Now he's part of the Ethiopian legation that is negotiating in Russia the acquisition of modern military equipment. Well, I guess that now he and his siblings must find their place in life. I've already found mine, in a country that I could never have imagined, but now all that's left for me to do is living my final years happily and peacefully, surrounded by my loved ones.
