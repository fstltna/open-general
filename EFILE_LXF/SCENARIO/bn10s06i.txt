
LE HAVRE - 8 JAN 1941

North of Le Havre, France

As you may know, a part of the British Home Fleet which is loyal to the new King is temporarily interned in French Le Havre. This morning we received reports that some of the ship crews rebelled, instigated by a local mob! They have overwhelmed our harbor guards and since the harbor is completely mined and they can't sail, they have begun to sink their ships. You have order to interrupt your transfer to Spain - move your forces immediately to Le Havre and stop these madmen before serious damage is done!

GOAL: Prevent that more than 12 ships are sunk, and destroy 8 of 8 enemy MSU's.
