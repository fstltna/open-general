Very good, Herr General, it is a glorious day! After a furious hand-to-hand struggle you have inflicted a painful defeat on the Piedmontese. You have driven them out of Lombardy. Carlo Alberto is ready to sign an armistice with us. Now we can focus on the Hungarian rebels. The Archduke Franz Josef himself sends his congratulations to you.
