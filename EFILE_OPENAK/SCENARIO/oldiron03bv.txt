03. The drive on Tunis - German counterattack on Medjez El Bab - BV

Congratulations. You have stopped the German counterattack and pushed them back way behind their starting positions. Unfortunately the enemy defensive line in front of Bizerte and Tunis is too strong for your exhausted forces to penetrate. Dig in and wait for reinforcements.
