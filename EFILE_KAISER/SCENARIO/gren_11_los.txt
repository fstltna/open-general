That my first clash with a modern army at Landrecies and Grand Fayt was a failure, I still regret. The Germans routed us and we left the II Corp's right flank exposed, so they nearly got trapped by the enemy at Le Cateau. We could do nothing but follow our march  to the South: fortunately the enemy did not pursue us for a few days.
