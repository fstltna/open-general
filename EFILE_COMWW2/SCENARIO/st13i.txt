Herr General: Preparations are complete! As you already know, von Manstein practically gave a guarantee to the Fuhrer that we would succeed in finally taking Stalingrad, therefore, failure or partial victory is not an option! One last thing Herr General, latest recon reports have confirmed that parts of the Volga river are sufficiently frozen over to allow a crossing, particularly in the Krasnoarmeysk and Svetlyy Tars vicinities..
