Anatoly! What are you doing? Go away and save your men if you can...the Reds will be here in a matter of minutes, you have no time to lose!

No...leave me. It's too late for me. My injury is too serious. There's nothing that you can do to save me. Even if you managed to take me to a hospital, I'd be dead before the end of the week. Leave me here...I'll try to delay our enemies for a while.

Please...take care of your mother, your sisters and your brother. Tell them that I loved them. Tell them to pray for my soul...and now go, my son. I'm very proud of you. Go, quickly!
