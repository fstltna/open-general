Toulon

Mar 6th, 1919

Here we are, ready for what could be the last offensive of the war. The Germans have opened a gap in the French defences at Saint Mihiel, and right now they're trying to reach the Marne. But we all know that France is a powerful country with many resources. They'll do anything to stop the German advance, and everybody is aware of that. So, naturally, Germany asked us to launch a secondary offensive in the French Mediterranean coast. Our enemies will find difficult to fight on two fronts at the same time.

We started our offensive some days ago, assaulting Nizza. However, the French defences at the Italian border have proved to be very strong. If we want to invade southern France, we must think about a different strategy.

That's why the High Command decided that your elite troops should disembark in Toulon. Under normal circumstances it would be a suicide, but right now most of the French and British fleets are in the Ärmelkanal, supporting the Entente troops in northern France. If you make it, you'll save thousands of lives.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.

Special notes: 
- You won't have any supply hexes in this scenario. After all, you're behind the enemy lines.
- An armoured cruiser has been added to your core.
