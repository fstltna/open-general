We don't get tired of your splendid victories. In Bitola the Germans have succeeded, too. Now, while they attack Athen, our units will chase the remnants of the British army and besiege Thessaloniki. But don't worry, the Bulgarians and some of our second line divisions can do that task. Even without your expert guidance the war in the Balkans will be over soon, and now it's more important that you go back to the Italian front. We have great plans for our enemies there. You'll love them, that's for sure.
