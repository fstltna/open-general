Port Said (Operation Rotterdam)

November 9th, 1942

We cannot leave the entrance of the Port under British control, however we must send our main units to over-run El Cairo. Following that idea, the High Command has designed an operation to take Port Said using few units, like in May of 1940 in the Low Countries. 

,,Operation Rotterdam''

- Use the elite units of the Raemcke brigade and the Folgore division to take far mission objetives, like Port Said and El Qmic.
- The ground forces must take Darakisha and El Matariya, and then, drive to the Canal. Maybe the elite air units will need help.
- The 101st Italian Trieste division should drive directly to Port Said.
- You should complete the operation as soon as possible, because the assault on El Cairo must begin in two or three days.
