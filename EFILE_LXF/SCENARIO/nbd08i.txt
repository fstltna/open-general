The Afrika Korps has been pushed back from Kasserine.  Many of their best 
units have ben called back to Mareth to help hold off the British. Now is the 
time to strike. You must launch an assault out of Gafsa, capture El Guettar and 
then proceed towards the coast. Eventually we hope to link up with our British 
Allies and finish off the Afrika Korps.
