We thought that we could break through the Italian lines much faster than you actually did. Well, it doesn't matter. We've taken thousands of prisoners, and Austria-Hungary is safe for the moment. The Italians won't dare to attack them for some time.
The situation is worse in the Western Front. The French have been relatively quiet since the failure of the Nivelle Offensive, but the British have taken us to the limit. In spring they defeated us at Messines, and after that we could hardly resist them at Passendale. If they try again this year I don't know what could happen.
