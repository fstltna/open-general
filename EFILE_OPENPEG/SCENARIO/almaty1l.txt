The Russians expended great effort and resources to rebuild their forces, and your disastrous loss at Almaty has thrown it all away. It seems they would have been better served building housing for the refugees that are streaming across the Urals to escape Chinese occupation. At this point, these refugees are unlikely to ever see their homes again. It should come as no surprise that the Russian President’s request for your dismissal has been granted.
