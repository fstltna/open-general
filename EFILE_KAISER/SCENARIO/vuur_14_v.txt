We've captured Roberts and most of his staff. The Kakies have hundreds of casualties and we've taken lots of prisoners. Four British divisions have been virtually annihilated. Congratulations!

In the front of Ladysmith, and after three failed attempts, General Buller finally managed to defeat our troops, commanded by General Botha, and a few days ago he lifted the siege of the town. But you have made the British victory useless. Botha will stop Buller in the Drakensberge passes, and while the British divisions waste their time in Natal you will be able to attack Kimberley without any interference. However, this time you won't have Cronjé and de Wet by your side. Their troops must go north and destroy the last British pockets of resistance there, in Mafikeng and Gaberones.
