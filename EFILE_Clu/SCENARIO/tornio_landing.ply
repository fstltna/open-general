Clu's Tornio Landing

After the peace agreement with the USSR the Finns were forced to remove the German troops from their territory. Thus the invasion of Kemi was planned by Lieutenant-General Siilasvuo and the 3rd Infantry Division was embarked at Oulu and set sails northwards. However Kemi was reported to be held by German troops and Siilasvuo decided to land at Tornio where his troops met only minor oposition. The 11th Infanty Regiment landed unopposed at Röyttä harbour and took the town by surprise. The bad weather forced the German aircraft to stay on the ground most time.
Meanwhile the 15th Jaeger Brigade and parts of the Lagus Armoured Division advanced to Kemi from the south. During the next days all German attempts to re-capture Tornio failed and Kemi itself was surrounded by the Finns. However the Germans were able to secure the road to Rovaniemi and retreat in orderly fashion northwards.
