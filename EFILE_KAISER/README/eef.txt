"THE LAST CRUSADE" - The Egyptian Expeditonary Force 1915-18

THE CAMPAIGN:
When Turkey joined the Central Powers in November 1914, the new enemy threatened the most vital supply line of the British Empire - the Suez Canal. The Egyptian Army was weak, and the Canal only defended by some battalions of the Indian Army. But soon troops from all over the Empire flooded into the Nile Delta. 
Many came only for a few months of training before they were shipped to the Western Front.
However, some remained in Egypt and built the nucleus of the army that was to fight all its way across the desert into the heart of the Holy Land - The Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF), as it was officially named in March 1916.
The EEF was an "imperial" force in its true sense. Indian Ghurkas fought alongside Scotsmen, Australian Lighthorsemen beside New Zealand Mounted Rifles and the Imperial Camel Corps. This is their story...
