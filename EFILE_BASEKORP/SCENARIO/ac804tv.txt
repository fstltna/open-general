Herr General!

Our strike accross the Muese into France was most difficult, only through our sheer will did we prevail.

Even though your corps was key in our success, your cooperation with General Guderian was somtimes strained, our two country's forces must learn to work more closely together.

Good luck in your next mission, I must depart to catch up to the drive to the channel.
