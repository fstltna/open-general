
ASTRAKHAN - 13 MAY 1942

South of Astrakhan, South Russia

A promotional success for you, that troops under your command could as first reach a goal of the A-A line. Well, reaching the Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan line was originally planned for the year '41, but it will still attract attention when your troops have taken Astrakhan. According to latest information, for the end of '42 as the strategic objective the meeting of the Japanese and German forces at the Yenisei River near the 70th meridian east is planned. Well, perhaps the general staff should first make sure that Moscow is taken!

Anyway, Astrakhan is not strong fortified and estimated only 3 divisions defends the Volga river delta. But we are informed that reinforcements downstream the Volga river and will arrive soon. So act immediately and fast! You get several construction battalions at hand to overcome the numerous waterways.

GOAL: Take all VH's!

NOTE: All axis nations auxiliaries are under your command.

Main reinforcements:
6th turn - southwest, Slovakian Regiment-size combat group
