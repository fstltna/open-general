Saint Quentin Canal

September 29th, 1918

While you were fighting at Saint Mihiel the British launched a counteroffensive in north-western France, with the final goal of breaking the Hindenburg Line. They've been successful so far, but for the next phase of their operation they need our help. So, this time, your units will be attached to the Australian Corps of the 4th British Army.

Your mission is as simple as it is dangerous: you must pierce the German defence lines at the Saint Quentin Canal. Once you've opened a gap, your units will be relieved and the Australians will pursue the retreating Germans. Just like it happened in Saint Mihiel, the key to victory will be the coordinated use of combined arms.


Victory conditions:
- Take all the enemy VHs.
