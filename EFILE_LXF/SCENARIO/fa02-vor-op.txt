12/07/1939   They Shall Not Pass!

Welcome, Sir.
Until now we were able to hold the front here at the river Kolaanjoki. We now need you to help us to stabilize our positions.
Situation report: Although we fought tooth and nail the Soviets still drove us out of Suojarvi. Tanks caused panic among our troops and we were driven far back.
Enemy: The complete 56th Rifle division is storming down the road to Loimola.
Our forces: You are to command every group in the battle-area. We will try to gather up some more artillery, but don't expect too much.

The Soviets have to be stopped here. Otherwise the whole 4th Corps may become encircled.

Kenraalimajuri Haegglund, CIC 4th Corps
