The "real" battle of Manila
(13 August 1898)
v 1.1
The sunset of the Spanish Empire - The Spanish American War 1898

General,

As you know, since June several contingents of American land forces have arrived to the Philippines. By now, some 12,000 U.S. troops under Major General Wesley Merritt have landed and are moving towards Manila to assault and occupy the city.

Following the defeat of Admiral Cervera's Squadron in Santiago de Cuba, it is unlikely that reinforcements will be sent to us. Do not expect any help from the Metropolis.

The American commanders, General Merritt and Commodore Dewey, have dared to suggest Governor Jáudenes, Augustín's replacement, an outrageous agreement to surrender Manila after a "mock" battle consisting in a brief naval bombardment and infantry assault. It goes without saying that a Spanish officer and gentleman cannot accept such a humiliating offer. We count on your sharp fighting to defend the Spanish flag. 

The objective of the defence of Manila is not only a question of honour but also to give us a stronger bargaining position at the peace settlement.

Victory conditions: To hold 7 VH for a BV; 5 VH for a V and 3 VH for a TV.
