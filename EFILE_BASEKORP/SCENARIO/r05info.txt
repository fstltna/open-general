05. ROSTOV 1941 (25 November 1941)

Our situation has reached a new depth. In the north the fascists have reached Leningrad and they are advancing on Moskva on the central front. In the south the fascists have captured Odessa, broken through into the Crimea, and days ago Rostov. Rostov is the gate to the Caucasus and its oilfields. We cannot allow the enemy to hold this position. An immediate counterattack has been ordered!

The Germans have taken Rostov with a number of motorized and armoured formations with lightening speed. However in the urban area of Rostov they have a huge disadvantage. Even more, the fascists advance has created a salient into our lines and this offers the possibility of encircling the fascists at Rostov. The winter has arrived and the plains are covered with snow. This is the time to attack again and drive them back west! Good luck, comrade.
