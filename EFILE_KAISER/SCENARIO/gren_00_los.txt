The Zulus fought valiantly, and managed to retreat in good order despite the efforts of our experienced and well equipped soldiers. They were a threat for our patrols until the end of the war.

I will always remember this first battle; the screaming, the confusion, the thought that the world was coming to an end. The initial fear and the anger that came after it. I experienced those sensations every time that I entered combat, but they were never as intense as against the Zulus. Somehow, that South African valley will stay with me for the rest of my life. 

A few days later my Colonel ordered me to meet him at his tent. He was impressed by my performance against the enemy, and that he knew that I had repeatedly asked for my transfer to the Grenadier Guards. He told me that, although he regretted losing such a promising young officer, he knew that I would have a brighter destiny in that unit, so he would recommend my transfer as a reward for my behaviour in battle.
