
ST. VALERY-EN-CAUX - 12 JUN 1940

The strategic situation is worse than ever. The Germans have crossed the Somme and Aisne Rivers and Paris is about to fall. The Maginot Line is holding out but will soon be encircled. But the war still continues!

Since the German breakthrough at the Somme, retreat after retreat has followed. The Germans have highly mobile Panzer Divisions and have reached the Seine River sooner than we could. The result is that most of our 10th Army including British elements are cut off from further retreat. Our only option is to evacuate by sea and try fighting another day!

Only two ports in the area are still in French hands: Dieppe and St. Valery-en-Caux. Try to reach them and prevent them from falling into enemy hands too soon. Evacuate as many troops you can!

GOAL: Reach the Exit Points and retreat at last 6 of your units!
