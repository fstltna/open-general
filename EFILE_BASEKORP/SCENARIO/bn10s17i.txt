
ISFAHAN - 8 SEP 1941

Basra, Iraq/Iran Border

The General Staff suspected already an Anglo-Soviet operation against the pro-German Iran. Since the 25th of August the presumption is now reality - but it's become now a Soviet solo through the resignation of India from the war, which makes the things not really easier. Three Soviet armies have crossed the border in the north and progress rapidly into the Iranian interior. The Iranian army is unable to stop this onslaught and Reza Shah Pahlavi asked us for help. For a defense of Tehran, it is now too late - try to stop the soviet advance together with the Iranians at Isfahan! You've to run about 400 km until Isfahan - order your troops in motion immediately!

GOAL: Take all VH's!

NOTE: All axis nations auxiliaries are under your command.
