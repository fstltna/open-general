The Romanians have been no match for your troops. Now nothing will stop us until we reach Bukarest. In the south the news are excellent, too. The Bulgarians have defeated the combined Romanian and Russian forces in Dobrudscha and now they're on their way to the port of Kreis Constanta. Caught between two fires, the remnants of the Romanian Army will soon be forced to surrender. This front will be quiet before Christmas. Yes, I know that you've heard that before, but this time I assure you that it's true.
