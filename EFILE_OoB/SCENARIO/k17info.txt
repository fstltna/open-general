17. HELSINGBORD (2 May 1945)

TO: Grossadmiral
SUBJECT: Escape to Norway

---Germany is almost fully occupied by the enemy. We will be forced to surrender soon. The Kriegsmarine, however, will not lose our honour like the Hochseeflotte in the Great War, which was interned at Scapa Flow, luckily scuttled before the British could gain access to Germany's finest fleet. Konteradmiral Ludwig von Reuter saved by doing so the honour of the German Navy in the Great War. If we lose our war, we will go down fighting, instead, just as the Hochseeflotte desired until a mutinee in Kiel broke out...

Soon we will lose our last bases in Germany. Denmark will not be long in our hands either. Our best shot will be Norway, and the port of Oslo. The Army has over 300,000 troops still in Norway. You will steam to Norway and reinforce them for a last heroic stand!

The Allies, and even neutral Sweden, will try to prevent this. Soviet flotillas are searching for your flotilla, which contains all bigger ships of the Kriegsmarine at this date. The Swedish Navy will try to prevent us from reaching Norway also. Allied bombers might intercept us instead. You must reach Norway never the less. Violating of Swedish territory to get there, is allowed, as everything is to face death worthy in remembrance of the Hochseeflotte! Noch einmal!---
