Gospodin General-Major, you have achieved an unprecedented victory in this war!  The most powerful fortresses of Lemberg and Przemysl - Austria's pride of fortress engineering - have ceased to protect her borders within two months of commencement of hostilities.  After a prolonged siege that lasted until May 1915 over 150,000 Austrian defenders of the fortress surrendered.  Your action in the siege itself has warranted your troops rest, and you will be redeployed to the front for the Campaign of 1915.
