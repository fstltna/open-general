With the capture of Reims the new Entente lines near the Marne have been outflanked. Besides, our 6th Army has pushed through the gap that you've opened at Soissons and, overcoming all opposition, has captured Chateau-Thierry, west of your current position. 
Now the path of retreat from the Marne back to Paris is blocked, and the French forces are split. While a large portion of them is retreating southwards, the rest is falling back on Paris before we besiege the city. The only remaining entrenched zones are the British lines to the north.
