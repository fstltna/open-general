Karfreit

Oct 24th, 1917

Finally, it's time to turn the tables on the Italians. Our artillery bombardment has finished, the poison gas has gone away, and now you must storm the Italian positions between Görz and Udine. At the same time, the Germans will strike near the town of Karfreit, north of here. The High Command believes that this joint offensive will be able to break through the Italian lines. If we do it fast enough, we'll trap two enemy armies at the Isonzo.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.

Special note:
- This could be a good opportunity to upgrade some of your units.
