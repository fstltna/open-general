Comrade Commisar, you did what you could. Unfortunately, the Romanians crossed the Tisza at Tokaj, the Revolutionary Governing Council has resigned, most leaders are fleeing to Vienna. Our Soviet Republic has collapsed. However, we don't stop dreaming about a better future. Save your life and join your comrades fighting for a perfect, communist society all around the world!

Thanks for playing the campaign!
