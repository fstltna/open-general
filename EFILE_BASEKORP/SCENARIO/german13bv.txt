The Fifth Battle of Courland ended disastrously for the Soviets, who lost 70 thousand dead and wounded, hundreds of tanks and planes for no real gain. The tide of war couldn't be turned back, though. The Axis forces remained trapped in Courland, where they capitulated on 9th May 1945.

This is the end of the campaign. The design started as an experiment if it's possible to make anything reasonable in 48 hours. But the project got out of hand pretty fast and it took me many months to finish, mainly due to the fact that I tinkered with lots of settings, ideas and details. I hope you liked the campaign!
