Herr General, you have narrowly achieved your objectives.  Unfortunately, the Soviet armies have been able to withdraw in good order and regroup behind new defensive lines.  You are obviously suffering from combat stress and will be reassigned to oversee the construction of beach defenses in Norway.  Dismissed.
