The Italians have been completely routed, and have fled to the outskirts of Venedig. If we had more men and more supplies, we could keep striking our enemies until they had to surrender. But neither us, nor the Germans, thought that our victory would be so complete. Now we don't have enough reserves to keep on advancing, so we'll have to stop and dig in.

At least we've taken thousands of prisoners. The Italians won't dare to attack us for some time. For the first time in two years, the Empire is safe.

With Serbia defeated, Russia falling apart and Italy on the defensive, we don't have any real reason to remain in this war. It's a pity that France and the United Kingdom are so stubborn that they won't accept a negotiated peace. We'll have to keep on fighting until one side finds a winning strategy and the other collapses. 

Since the United States hasn't entered the war, the Germans think that they don't need any reinforcements in France and Belgium. That means that, if Russia finally surrenders, we'll be able to reinforce the secondary fronts, and destroy the Entente forces there. So prepare yourself, General. If Russia falls, our next goal will be winning the war at the Balkans.
