THE BATTLE OF GAZALA May27 1942

After giving up the Cyrenaica to the Brits in the aftermath of Crusader last year December, our German allies launched a couteroffensive in January. That offensive brought us back to Gazala where all parties have been preparing for a new offensive.

The DAK and our XX Corps with Ariete and Trieste started moving South last evening, swinging around the most Southern point of the Allied defensive line: Bir Hacheim. Your Ariete division and Trieste are tasked with taking out the defensive positions at Bir Hacheim. The DAK's objectives are to engage and take out the enemy armor and reach Tobruk - the goal of our offensive. Our X and XXI Corps assisted by the German 15th Schutzen Brigade will launch faint attacks against the Gazala line (N of this map - not covered by this scenario).

Bad news has just come in from Trieste: they are lost in the desert after a navigation error.

News: The German 6th Army is preparing for a major offensive on Stalingrad. British and Indian forces are on the retreat in Burma.
