Tunis
¯¯¯¯¯
Herr General, as you know the Americans landed in Northwest Afrika in November.  While Feldmarschall Rommell executed a fighting withdrawal against the British, though outnumbered 10 to 1, the American drive from the west has met with little resistance.  It is imperative that the Allied drive be stopped. You must help Feldmarschall Rommel defeat the Allies. In addition iyou have to take full responsibility for the survival of the Freldmarschall.

The High Command agreed reluctantly to your demand that all arrangements for the transportation of your troops to Tunisia be handled by direct courier, never by radio.  Our Enigma codes are unbreakable of course, but since Feldmarschall Rommel supported you in this we agreed. It is undoubtedly only a coincidence that the convoy carrying you and your troops had no Allied interference.
