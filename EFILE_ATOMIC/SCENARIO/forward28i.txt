Breakthrough at Dessau
After some planning the general stuff has decided that we will attack the allied lines at Dessau. The allies have numerous troops at this front line, so, if we can break through their lines, the allies must withdraw their other troops.
Your troops:
Besides your tank army one army will support your attack. They are deployed west of your troops.
Enemy troops:
The enemy have several tank divisions. In the air you have to calculate with high resistance, too. The USAF and RAF have several air fleets in the area of Dessau. Several level-bomber squadrons will support the ground troops.
