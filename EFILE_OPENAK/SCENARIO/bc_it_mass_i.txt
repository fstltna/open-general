MASS SOUTHBANK
October 16th, 1944

The Canadians are currently engaged in bitter fighting to clear both banks of the Scheldt estuary, which would allow us the use of the port of Antwerp.  In order to protect the Canadian Army from counter-attacks on its flank, Montgomery has ordered you to clear the southbank of the Mass river.
