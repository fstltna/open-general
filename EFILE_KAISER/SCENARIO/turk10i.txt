Fighting in Kafkasya: Arhavi- Findikli -  23 January 1916

During the year 1915 the Ottoman Empire stand firm against many enemies. The western boundaries of the empire were safe, but in the begining of 1916 danger came from the east: the British Army attacked in Mesopotamia, and at the same time the Russian Army attacked through the Kafkasya (Caucasus) mountains. 

Now, the defensive positions of the Turkish 3rd Army are stretched from the coast of the Karadeniz (Black Sea) to lake Van. The main goal for the Russian forces is the mighty fortress of Erzurum. The Turkish forces around the fortress are decimated after the battle of Koprukoy and the V Corps will be sent as a reinforcements from Gelibolu to Erzurum. Keeping the roads from the ports of the Karadeniz to Erzurum is vital. 
The Russians plan an attack against the Arhavi-Findikli section of our defensive coastal line. Our forces are weak, outgunned and outranged. And the Russians dominate in the skies and the sea, too. 

Orders: Keep the road from the shores to the mountains clear of enemies: hold 3 Victory Hex for a regular (and quite satifying) victory. If possible, repel Russian the attack and hold 4 VH for a brilliant victory. At least stop the Russian advance and hold 1 VH for a tactical victory.

Inteligence report: the Turkish HQ promised a few mobile units as reinforcements. Also, the Germans promised to send their best men to stop the Russians. Bad weather can help in holding the defensive lines.

Good Luck!
