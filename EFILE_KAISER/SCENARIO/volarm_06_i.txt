Grozny

Feb 1st, 1919

The arrival of my family in Novorossiysk was one of the happiest moments in my life. Finally, we're together again. I could spend just three days with them before returning to the battle front, but now I know that I'll return to them soon.

The Terek is the last redoubt of the Soviets in Southern Russia. Once we pacify this area our rearguard will be safe. There is no time to lose, because now that the Great War has finished and the Germans have retreated from Ukraine, the Red Army will be able to send reinforcements to the Donbass and Tsaritsyn. If we don't finish the Terek campaign soon we might find ourselves fighting in two fronts, something we can't afford.

While General Wrangel fights in Vladikavkaz I must take Grozny and cut the Bolsheviks' escape route. The town is being defended by the 12th Red Army and some Chechen volunteers. It's surprising that these muslim warriors have allied themselves with an army of atheists, but I guess that their hatred against the Terek cossacks is stronger than their theological coherence.

Victory conditions: 
- Take all the VHs.
