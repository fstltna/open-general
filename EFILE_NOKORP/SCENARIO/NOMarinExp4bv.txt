Gibraltar is ours, that's a great victory! Excellent work commander, they never knew what hit them! It's even possible that the British will sue for peace now they have been as good as cut off from their eastern colonies.

Our army is landing in Gibraltar and will repair the installations.
Get your ships repaired, your task is not over. Not before we rule the Mediterranean! (We and our Italian allies, yes, yes)
