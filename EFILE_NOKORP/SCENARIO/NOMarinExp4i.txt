It's 4 years now that we want to take the strategically important naval base of Gibraltar, but to reach Gibraltar our armies would need to cross through Spain, and Franco has remained reluctant to enter the war on our side.

Now, with your naval assault force operational and battle-proven, time has come at last to seize this fortress, cutting off Britain from its eastern empire. Gibraltar is also the door to the Mediterranean, with Gibraltar under our control, the Mediterranean belongs to us! (And to our Italian allies, yes, of course.)

It shouldn't be too hard, the British don't expect us. Given some parts of their Mediterranean fleet might be nearby, High Command has detached one of our new and revolutionary Type XXI U-Boats. Her captain is a very experienced North Atlantic raider, and you know what they say about U-Boat crews: They are either good or dead.
I'm sure you will find them a big help in scouting and attacking vessels you'd rather not meet foot to foot.

Prepare yourself, you're leaving for the Mediterranean!


Instructions: Take all VHs. Enjoy your new core unit, a submarine you'll get to keep.
Note you won't be able to upgrade or buy stuff while you're sailing the seas, so this is your last chance to do so for some time.
