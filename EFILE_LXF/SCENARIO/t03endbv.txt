A superb performance, General. Those were some heavy fights, weren't they? But you proved to be an excellent commander. Yes, General, our men have gained more experience than could ever be gained in training. The Germans are also happy. The Germans have already taken the Ukraine, Baltics and are advancing on Moscow. And now we have joined the war and are pushing the Soviets out of the Caucasus. And Britain has declared war on us, General. That means that your forces are transported to our southern borders.
