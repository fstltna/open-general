The Red Army didn't expect our reaction, and all its attempts to defend itself failed. When August came the 5th Army was nearly destroyed, and only the skills of their leader Tukhachevsky prevented the Bolshevik divisions from a complete destruction. The surviving communists retreated to the Miass river, where they waited until Lenin and Trotsky sent them more reinforcements.

Our enemies were still too strong, so we couldn't fully exploit our victory. We waited in Chelyabinsk until the Soviets came again, and then we withdrew our troops deeper into Siberia. We knew that they were suffering much more than us and that, if we kept on winning defensive battles and strategic counterattacks, sooner or later we'd have a chance for a decisive victory.
