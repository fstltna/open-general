Crete - Operation "Merkur"

The british troops on the inland Crete were a thorn in Hitlers eye. On one side long-ranged bombers from Crete were able to attack the war-important petrol fields in Ploesti, on the other side the navy units garrisoned in and near Crete were a always present danger for the supply for africa. After the fast victory against Greece - since now the third blameful Loose for the english ground troops - it seems to by a good idea to take this base from the  beaten opponent, too. Paratroopers and special trained air landing troops, supported by massive air strikes of german and italian squadrons, should even in the first hours of "Merkur" occupate rollways and ports, which shall be used to transport heavy weapons and supply by air or ship. At four different points more than 7000 paratroopers were dropped - excactly in the fire of the tough fighting and under-estimated commonwealth troops. Is it possible to take Crete?
