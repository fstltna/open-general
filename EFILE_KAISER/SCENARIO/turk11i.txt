The siege of Kut al Amara, April 17th 1916

At the end of 1914 British troops, mainly from the British Indian Army, were sent to occupy the city of Basra and protect the oil refineries. Due to the Ottoman offensives in the Caucasus and in the Sinai, Mesopotamia was poorly defended and the British could easily advance up the Tigris river with the goal of capturing Baghdad if possible.

The advance went well initially but in November 1915 they arrived at Ctesiphon, some 40 km south of Baghdad, where the main Ottoman forces were waiting. After two days of battle, the Ottoman army was able not only to halt the British advance but also to force its retreat, after losing 1/3 of its strength.

The British invasion of Mesopotamia has therefore failed and Anglo-Indian troops have retreated back to the city of Kut al Amara, where they are now under siege. 

Orders: Your mission is to take Kut before British relief operations succeed in reaching the city. 

Only a BV is possible in this scenario so take and hold the only VH.

Intelligence report: British troops are expected to arrive along the Tigris river. You will have to count on your own resources since no reinforcements are availabe and only some supplies will be delivered to you. 

Warning: although, technically, you could deploy the Hamidiye in this scenario, it would be extremely unrealistic to do so. Whatever your decision is, in the remaining scenarios you won't be able to deploy the cruiser, so eventually your best option will be selling her.
