*** TOP SECRET ***

Il Duce,

It is my duty to report, that upon my arrival, that the situation is grave.

Even the titanic efforts by our Axis corps sent to save our IT 8th army were not enough to stem the Russian hordes - the Russians have just entered Kharhov!

Worse, the front is in disarray, 8th Army has been decimated and Hitler is in willful ignornace of the state of his armies.........

Sir, the good news is that our General is recovering and the majority of our troops were able to avoid encirclement, but perhaps it is time to leave Russia to the Germans.......
