General,

You valliantly kept your positions, but on the Weichsel and the Prut we were beaten, Soviet troops are streaming into Romania, and have attacked Bulgaria.

The attack on neutral Bulgaria proved a blessing for us: The Bulgarian government invited the English in and on the outskirts of Sofia these violently clashed with the Soviet troops. This was all the incident Churchill needed: the case of Bulgaria was blown up in the Anglo-American press, and thus came about the cease-fire with the western allies you undoubtedly heard of.

You will now hurry to Berlin to prepare the final battle
