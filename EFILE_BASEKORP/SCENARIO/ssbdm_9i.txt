   "IT has happened ILse"  
  The moment the Fuhress had been waiting for.In Berlin her secretary of War came in announcing "It had happened".What was 'IT'? 'IT was the British sending a large concentration of Fighter Squadrons to France with most being the fine 'Spitfire.Now the SS Air Korps could set the record straight.They had not been Lucky.They had not surprised anyone.They were better and here was the chance to prove it to the World.Though most of the Female Pilots could not stand up to a Male in staminia they could react faster and make decisions quicker.In a machine equal or even near equal the SS/BdM flyers were superior.In training and experience they were smarter and used better tactics.In fanatacism the 'Fraus had no equal in the History of Mankind or as Ilse like to state it 'in Womankind'.After this engagement in the Skies of France alarm would be sent to all the World, "Hey We the SS have no plans of wasting Our lives away so the Male Species of the World can succeed why We keep house,bear children and wait for the Man to come home with His paper,His Pipe and His houseshoes in Our hands".And on the SS airfields arrived a new Fighter,the FW 106.The 'Fraus were about to set the Record straight.Thanks Lucia Elenik Messer of Focke-Wulf for Your support even if Frau Heyfeld of Junkers was pissed.
