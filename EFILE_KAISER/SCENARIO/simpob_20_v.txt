We were so close... Our offensive ended on the right bank of the Tobol river, after having forced the Red Army to retreat more than 25 Russian miles. It was a great victory. However,  it wasn't good enough. Our enemies were beaten, but too many of them had survived. We had thrown everything that we had at them, and they were still capable of fighting back. They would recover themselves, and they would eventually crush us.

My last hopes were gone. We were doomed. Soon we'd have to choose between death, a life under the Bolshevik yoke, or leaving Russia forever.

It hasn't passed one single day that I haven't thought that, if we had advanced a little faster, or if the Cossacks had been more disciplined, we could have actually encircled the Soviet Army. But we failed at the worst possible time. We were facing a bleak future, and things would get much worse before the war was over.
