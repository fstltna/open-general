Battle of Ruda started in the early morning of 30th December 1943. Supported not only by their own tanks, but also by twelve Soviet T-34s, brigade captured the village, but only after a hard fight that cost the lives of 50 Czechoslovaks and some 150 Germans.

Brigade fought also on the next day, together with the soldiers of Soviet 169th Rifle Regiment. German resistance in Bila Cerkva was ferocious again, and Czechoslovaks losses numbered over four hundred men, with 66 of them killed in action. Czechoslovaks destroyed fifteen enemy tanks, four self-propelled guns and many other equipment; they killed at least fifty enemy men. Brigade was moved to reserve on the 2nd January 1944, and therefore it didn't take a part in final liberation of Bila Cerkva.

The 1st Czechoslovak Independent Brigade was then awarded the Order of Bogdan Khmelnitsky (1st grade).
