Herr Feldmarschall,

The island of Okinawa is the key to our campaign in the Japanese home islands.  We need the airfields here to launch air raids against Tokyo and other major cities.  You are familiar with amphibious assault from your experiences at Savannah, but also skilled with combined arms warfare, so you have been prioritized above the officers of the Kriegsmarine for this operation.

The Japanese fleet is battered but intact, and shelters here as well.  Work closely with Admiral Raeder and make sure that the Japanese ships cannot hinder your landings here on Okinawa.  The mission is of the utmost importance.
