Smolensk is an important city both strategically as well as politically, since it is considered to be the gate to Moscow - even if it is situated 450 km away from Moscow! The Soviets have several large armies gathered near the city. You cannot hope to beat them frontally so we will have to encircle them. You have been put in charge of the southern wing - cut them off as fast as you can!
