
FORT BENNING - 2 JUL 1943

Albany, Georgia, United States

On the border between Alabama and Georgia, southwest of Columbus is Fort Benning, a major base of the U.S. Army. This base is your next target! We do not know exactly how many troops stay there at the time, but the Americans will defend this base determined. Unfavorably the enemy seems to have recognized our intentions - our intelligence reports that strong enemy armored units are approaching from the east. The General Staff, however, still has the opinion that your troops are strong enough for this task and we continue as planned. Occupy Columbus and Fort Benning and repel any enemy counterattack if necessary!

GOAL: Take all VH's!

NOTE: All axis nations auxiliaries are under your command.

Main reinforcements:
3rd turn - south, Italian 3rd Mobile Division
