
INCIDENT AT WALWAL - 5 Dec 1934

Ogaden Desert, South-Eastern Ethiopia
CO General Emilio De Bono

Come in, General! Like you know, we build a new Fort in the Walwal Oasis. The Ethiopians argue that our Fort lies on their ground and placed an ultimatum to us, to left the Fort. To support their demand, Ethiopian troops were pulled together around the Oasis. It is time to teach the Ethiopians a lesson. Crack the besiege ring and carry out a rapid attack on the Ethiopian positions! General, we count on you!
