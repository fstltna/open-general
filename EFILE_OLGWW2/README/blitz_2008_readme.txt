1. General introduction
Craig Miller’s “Blitzkrieg!” for the Waffenkammer e-file is probably the most enduring and popular user-made campaign for PG2. In 2005-2006 I made a modified/upgraded version of this campaign and Miller’s campaign “Greater Europe” called MillerBlitz+ for the Adlerkorps.

Blitz 2008 is an even more upgraded and modified version of Miller’s original campaigns thus the need for a new campaign name even though I at the same time realize that there is a risk of confusion between various versions of these campaigns. This version for the Latingenerals e-file is a playtested conversion of my AK version.

Included in Blitz 2008 is a choice scenario which will let you choose which of the two campaigns you would like to play “Blitzkrieg!” or “Greater Europe”

2. Credits and contact information
2a. Credits
The initial Brest-Litovsk briefings and victory statements are based upon those created by Andreas Seidel as part of his Brest-Litowsk scenario. The Narvik scenario is by Dennis Felling and is a part of his Marinenkorps campaign. It has then been slightly changed by me to fit into this campaign. Credit is also due to the campaign designer himself (Craig Miller) for having orginally created this extended version of SSI Blitzkrieg. 

I am also grateful to Luis Guzman for his PG2 Suite without which this conversion hadn’t been possible (or would have taken a lot longer to finish)

Credit is also due to various map makers which have made this updated version possible. Without their work I would probably NOT have done such an extensive update.

2b. Contact information
Any comments on this campaign can be posted either on JP's PGII Main forum or on the BP's Scenarios and Campaign forum, which I visit almost daily.

3. Installation instructions
3a) General instructions
These are the items you need to get started (there are other some optional possibilities as well, such as sound/smacks, but you really don't need that to get the game started: 

- The original game (with a MAP folder that you will have to create yourself). In this MAP folder you need to place all *.shp files for the user made maps needed for this campaign (see 3c). You will also need some of the original SSI map files as well, so be sure to have all of these in the same MAP folder.
- The unofficial PG2 2.20 exe (which replaces the original exe- without this one you will NOT be able to use the new efiles, and in consequence you can't play many of the newer campaigns) which is found at Steve's Clearinghouse http://www.wargamer.com/pg2campaigns/steve/clearinghouse/pg2-mods_n_stuff.htm (Look in "Tools and Utilies" for New “Unofficial” v. 2.20 Patch by 008) 
- The graphics update (which replaces the original panzer2.dat) (this is an update that comes out twice a year -always make sure you have the latest one - without this one you will not see the new icons used by new efiles) which is also found at: Steve's Clearinghouse http://www.wargamer.com/pg2campaigns/steve/clearinghouse/pg2-mods_n_stuff.htm#graphics (Look in "Graphics Upgrade" for New Panzer2.dat – latest version February 2008) 
- The LatinGenerals efile  which you can find at http://gilestiel.nerim.net/lg/ The latest version of the efile at the time of the release of this campaign was version 5.2 (but the campaign was created using version 4.6, so any version after 4.6 should work fine)

3b. Installing custom maps
Most campaigns use custom maps -- maps created by users which are not part of the original collection of maps that came with the game. Here is what you need to do in order to use custom maps. It is a process which is made up of two separate parts. 

First you have to create a "Map" directory in your PG2 directory, where you will have to move all the original SSI maps. This is a one-time procedure that will not need to be repeated in the future (and will also allow you to play PG2 without the CD in the your CD-ROM drive!). So copy the Map folder from your PG2 CD-ROM into your Main Panzer2 directory on your hard drive. Then de-select "read only" on all the .SHP files in that folder. One of the most common mistakes is to forget to de-select the "read-only" 

Then you'll have to get the maps (both the .SHP files and the .MAP files for each new map) needed for this campaign. 

Please note that a PG2 map consist of two separate parts - one *.map file, which often is included in the campaign download, and a number of *.shp files that are never included in the campaign download - these can be found on the several map sites available to PG2 gamers (see the post immediately following this one for more information) 

the *.map files. The campaign read me will almost always specificy which user-made maps you need, and it will also specify if the *.map files are included in the campaign download or not. If not you will have to go to Steve's Clearinghouse and download "All the *.map files" 

This download is continuously updated by Steve, so always make sure you have the latest one. This download should go into your SCENARIO folder (Please note that the most common mistake is to put this download in your MAP folder). Please also note that if you're planning on using the PG2 campaign builder and build your own campaigns, you can't have more than 200 *map files in your SCENARIO folder, since this will make the scenario builder crash. 

the *.shp files. The campaign read-me will always specify which user-made maps you need, and you will have to go to one of the three map sites, and download each and every one. One by one... (see the post immediately following this one for more information)

3c. Maps needed
In addition to standard SSI maps the following 38 user-made maps are required (map numbers in parenthesis in those cases where there might be some confusion as to which map to use).
Gruziadz, Kuhmo, Narvik2 (264), Gibraltar (99), Litovsk, Volkhov, Raate, Kreta2 (122), Sevastopol, Stalingrad, Tunis, Alamein, Alexandria,Viipuri Bay, Leningrad Center, Moscow, England, Kaunas, Konrad2/Budapest (340), Sio, Kazan Snow, Oboyan, Karelia Summer, Korsun Pocket (239), Matruh2 (515), Ceuta, Prokhorovka (268), Soltsy, Novogeorgievsk, Szekesfehervar South East (494), Iasi, Budapest South East, Warsaw East, Euro (346), Caen West, Avranche, Tula South, Operation Sealion (288) (Do NOT use Sealion #32)

4. Campaign development notes
4a. Map and scenario changes
Compared to my earlier conversion/campaign called MillerBlitz+, there have been substantial changes both as regards to map selection and as to scenario design in an effort to modernize the campaign. However the campaign still retains the Blitzkrieg style that made the campaign so popular when it was released. One major change has been the removal of the Malta scenario in the Blitzkrieg! campaign path, which has been replaced by a Barbarossa scenario (Brest Litovsk). When it comes to scenario changes you will find that there are less enemy arty and less enemy aircraft, although some might think there are still too many.
In many scenarios I also use different settings on current/basic strength, which prevents enemy units from refitting to maximum. Most BV limits have been fine-tuned, and the caps/prestige settings have been overhauled to make this campaign play very differently at different prestige settings. In some scenarios I’ve also removed many of the flagged hexes in order to make the AI play better.

5. Important information
Please note that this campaign uses the same scenario names that my MillerBlitz+ so you can’t have both this campaign and MillerBlitz+ in your scenario folder at the same time.
