Kiev encirclement - Konotop 

Hitler has decided you and the rest of Guderian's 2nd Pz Gruppe need turn South to assist Von Rundstedt's less successful Armee Gruppe Sud in the encirclement of Kiev - Ukraine. 
Opposing your forces is the newly created Russian 40th Army assisted by the 2nd Air-landing Corps and the 10th Tank Division.
