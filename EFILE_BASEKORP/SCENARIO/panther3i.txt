Unternehmen Zitadelle (5 Jul 1943)
Fourth part of the "Blitzkrieg!" minicampaign.

STRATEGIC SITUATION:
The upcoming battle of the Kursk salient is meant to reverse the tide of the war with the Soviet Union. Once successfull, it will bring the strategic initiative back into our hands.

TACTICAL ORDERS:
In preparation for the offensive, you received anxiously awaited Panzer IVs. These are older tanks, but at least they are reliable and there are sufficient numbers of them available. The upgunned, long-barrelled version is a formidable foe for every Soviet armoured vehicle.
Your orders are to break through the Soviet defense and pierce deep into their lines, concentrating on enemy strongpoints and tanks.

RECONNAISSANCE:
In front of you stand massively built defensive positions, full of anti-tank, air defense and field artillery, with mines, bunkers, and entrenched infantry. Soviets have solid air support, and some T-34s are in reserves.

NOTE: There's no way how to cross the rivers except by the bridges.

VICTORY CONDITIONS:
Capture all Victory Hexes to claim the victory!
