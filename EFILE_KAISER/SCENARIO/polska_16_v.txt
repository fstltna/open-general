Well done! After all of your stunning victories, it's time for our diplomats to exploit your successes. I just hope they are as competent as you!

You must feel proud of yourself, General! You will be remembered as one of our best military commanders. Poland will be forever in debt to you. 

We'll be glad to go with you to Wilno to offer our victory to Our Lady of Gate of Dawn. May our Lord give you a long and prosperous life.

The campaign is over. We hope you have liked it and thanks for playing!
