You haven't defeated the British, and French has been able to send reinforcements to Roberts. And, sadly, I have even worse news from Kimberley. Roberts has forced Cronjé to leave his positions at Magersfontein, and has trapped him at Paardeberg. In a matter of days Cronjé will be forced to surrender. You must go back to the Transvaal inmediately and try to save our country from the foreign invasion.
