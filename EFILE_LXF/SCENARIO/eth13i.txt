REBELLION IN SHOA

June 1st, 1938 (Ankoberino and Menz Regions, Shoa Province, Ethiopia)

The nobility and intelligentsia of the Ethiopian Empire had been liquidated or imprisoned and the last of its war-leaders defeated. The rank and file of its troops were disarmed. Calm was established almost everywhere except for a few scattered bands in the outlying regions of Shoa.  
Bewildered, baffled and enraged by the totally unexpected and daily worsening situation in a Roman Empire which his officials had considered pacified, the Italians directed their first fury.

The killing of the clergy and the monks of Debra Libanos was at first hardly believed. The horror when the news was confirmed led instinctively to rebellion. Their leaders had been treacherously killed. Their clergy had been treacherously massacred. Like any race faced with extermination they instinctively rebelled.

Cavallero, the new troop commander, took up his command on 12 Jan. 1938. He wasted no time. Italian columns started marching out against the rebels. It was the beginning of a year of marching and counter-marching, maneuvering over lands of almost inconceivable grandeur where mountains range after mountain range stretched away unendingly to unseen horizons.

On 1 June, He moved columns hastily into position  AROUND THE ANKOBER MOUNTAINS. The object was to trap Abebe Aregai and stop him slipping across the Imperial Highway into the almost impenetrable heartland of Menz.
