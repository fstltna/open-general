Gibraltar has been taken and the Italian Fleet has sailed toward England. Your mission is to take London and the Industrial Heart of England before our limited shipping and storms in the English Channel force us to withdraw our invasion. High command has given you until September 30th to complete your mission, but we fear that you must succeed sooner or we will see the invasion falter before the British surrender. Operation Sealion is about to begin. Good Luck!
