Sino-French War - Landing at Keelung - October 1st, 1884


Ma chère femme,

Our Corps will land on the Formosan beaches in a few minutes, so I only have a brief moment to write you....
As you know, the Chinese refuse to support our claims on Tonkin [Northern Vietnam] and Negotiations to settle the matter peacefully have failed....
So, we will attack the important chinese Ports and some Villages around it, and must hold it until our reinforcements arrive ... 

Je t'embrasse, votre mari.


ORDERS: 

Lieutenant-Colonel Bertaux-Levillain, you are ordered to defeat the Chinese navy, land 1,800 marine infantry of the corps expéditionnaire de Formose in Keelung - northern Formosa, capture the Pei-tao coal mines and move inland. This should put enough pressure on the Chinese to give in to our demands.

Two additional infantry battalions are preparing to join your forces in a few days.


OBJECTIVES: Take all 4 victory hexes.

REMARKS: Stay careful: It isn't easy, as it looks.
