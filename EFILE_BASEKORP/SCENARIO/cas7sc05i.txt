Ahead of us lies Lemberg, one of the most important strategic points in Poland. You see, the battle for Poland is by no means decided yet. If they withdraw to the Narew-Weichsel-San line, they will hold us off until the British and French intervene and we are forced to detach some of our forces from the east. If you manage to cross the San and take Lemberg, you will have turned their flank and basically won the Polish campaign.
