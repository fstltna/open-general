LOSS

You have done more than well, comrade. You have stopped the Rumanian advance towards Odessa. They have suffered tremendous losses already however they will be attacking soon again. Conditions on the fronts elsewhere, force us to pull your experienced division back from Odessa and to the Crimea. The garrison of Odessa will continue to resist!
