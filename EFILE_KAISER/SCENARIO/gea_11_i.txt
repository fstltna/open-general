Siege of Kibata

By the end of 1916 the British had occupied the coastal towns of Lindi and Kilwa in German East Africa. From there they advanced into the mountain areas of Kibata and Narungombe. The Germans feared that from their positions at Kibata the British could take Liwale thus cutting the German escape route.  This caused Von Lettow-Vorbeck to order an assault against Kibata at the beginning of December.  It was strongly defended by veteran British colonial troops like the Gold Coast Regiment.
