BRILLIANT VICTORY

All of Vienna celebrates your victory. You have not only slowed the Germans down but also made them suffer some serious losses. The General Staff did not expect your divisions to return from your mission but you did so and you even drove them back from Linz! Now 1st, 2nd and 5th Divisions will have time to dig in at the Traun River with the Fast and 3rd Divisions in reserve. 6th and 7th Divisions and 8th Brigade will guard the Tirol and Salzburg sectors. Your regiment, along with 4th Division, will be kept in general reserve.
