MERSA MATHRUH - EXIT Gen.RICHIE August 1942 BV

Even though 8th Army is larger than our mobile forces, it was clear from the start that the British position could not be held. Their X Corps was positioned North of the Northern Escarpment and the XIII Corps was positioned South of the Southern escarpment with only a few weak demoralized troops positioned in the center. Both Corps were unable to support each other. Too bad most of the 2nd New Zealand Division broke through the encirclement and escaped to El Alamein.
