100 Regiments Offensive

1-11-1940, Shanzi, North-Central China

Again, the central committee of the ChCP has agreed to launch another guerrilla assault on the Japanese rearguard in co-operation with our Kuomingtan ''allies''.  Comrade Mao dislikes this attack, but China is calling for Chinese action against the invaders, and that's what we are going to carry out.  The main objectives must be the capture of enemy resources present in your area: the coal mines and factories.  Your battle plan includes some cities and don't forget to cut all enemy lines of communication.

Act as quick as possible, the Japanese are going to use all available means to defeat any try to stop their penetration into China.

Fu qi!
