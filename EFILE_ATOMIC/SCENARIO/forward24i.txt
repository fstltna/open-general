Operation Bagration
Now the time four our great offensives is come. Several armies will join the attack in Belorussia. Your troops should take Vitebsk.  Take the town and push forward to the west.
Your troops:
You will only have your tank army for this mission.
Enemy troops:
Vitebsk is secured by strong fortifications and the IX. Army Corps. Further south the VI. Army Corps hold the positions. The Germans have some good tanks and tank killers like Tiger II tanks and a division of Elefants. It could be a good idea to deploy your best troops in the south and push there forward and the rest can concentrate on Vitebsk.
