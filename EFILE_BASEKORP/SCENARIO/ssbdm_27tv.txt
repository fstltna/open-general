"Look there Kartrina,all those frozen bodies"."That could have been Us Gann,the Poor Devils.Must be 200.No place to go to get out of the Cold and just unlucky to wander in an area where the Ivans were before they retreated with Ivan destroying everything through their Scorched Earth Policy". "Gann,Kartrina come over here"."Oh Hell, Corporal Tammie is going to give Us Burial Detail".A lot of Frau's were buried on the Eastern Front from the Winter of '41.The Soviets took back some area so in early '42 land that the SS/BdM had payed for in Blood before would cost more.With offensive actions curtailed Stalins Armies were back up to strength as far as numbers.The advantage of course was in the experience and the SS had that in 'Spades.So when offensive actions began again the Frau's would once again move forward with the Soviets throwing horrendous numbers to try and prevent it.A place called Rostav now appeared on the Map.The SS needed it to set up Airbases to attack the Oilfields in the Caucasus.And of course Junkers 'Frau-Z finally appeared on the scene giving the Air Korps complete dominance in the Dogfighting over the Russian terroritory below.Even with the 'Frau-Z the Russians still had planes that appeared in the Skies and SS/BdM Forces both in the Sky and on the Ground kept saying to themselves "will this ever End".In Berlin the Fuhress looked out the window thinking the same.
