THE WHITE HOUSE; WASHINGTON,

Dear Sir,
very well done, Sir, but now we haveto call you back.... at the moment we are not able to send you support... and even more important:
we have to reconquer the important railway junction Harpers Ferry at all cost....
this is one of the strategic most relevant traffic junctions... who controls the railway supply will win the war !

THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
