The Russian President is outraged at your dismal performance in the defeat at Khabarovsk, stating that only American arrogance would demand entrusting the liberation of his country to a foreign commander. The Security Council can hardly argue after the losses of men and equipment you have suffered, and they have approved Gen. Donat Kapitsa as your replacement for the remainder of the operations in the Russian Far East. The transfer of command is effective immediately.

Hope you enjoyed the Western Campaign v1.1.  Any feedback, good or bad, can be directed to sdkfz173@gmail.com
