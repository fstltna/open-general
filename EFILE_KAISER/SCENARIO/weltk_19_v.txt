Now that you control Saint-Dizier the French forces have been forced to retreat from Nancy, that will fall in the next hours. Verdun is surrounded, and the siege will begin very soon. For the first time in almost five years we've been able to advance dozens of miles into France. Congratulations, General, you've earned the Pour le Mérite award! Nobody deserves it more than you.
