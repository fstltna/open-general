Herr General, the 21st and 40th Armies are in ruin and full retreat, no time to pause continue south the close the ring of steel.

The Panzers of Army Group Guderian were ordered to skirt the vital city of Konotop and speed south to close the ring around Kiev as fast as possible. OKH did not want a repeat of Smolensk where large amounts of Russian troops had been allowed to escape. By this stage most Panzer divisions had suffered large tank losses with many regiments down to 50% tank strength, with this in mind OKH ordered Panzer units to stay on the open Steppes where they could out manoeuvre the Russian armour rather than being wasted in street fighting. Starting on 5 September I.R. Grossdeutschland was tasked with road security operations along the Army group's axis of advance. By 8 September the Regiment went on the offensive, its objective was to establish bridgeheads across the Sejm River in the Putiwl region. The campaign entered a period of bitter fighting as Soviet resistance stiffened around the Sejm bridgeheads. As they approached Konotop, 14 September saw the Regiment prepare to assault Schilowka and cut the Kiev-Kursk-Moscow railway line. After completing this mission the Regiment turned to the west. The rifle companies advanced behind the assault guns and the enemy was finally thrown back after bitter fighting. On the 15th GD's attacks continued through Shilkova, ending up with the final objective, Konotop, being secured on the 16th.
