
TIENCHIACHEN FORTRESS
13 Sep 1938

Part of Battle of Wuhan
Mid-June - Mid-November 1938

In early June 1938 Japanese troops, supported by naval vessels, began maneuvering along both banks of the Yangtze River. On June 24, the Japanese attacked Matang, somewhat beyond the midway point between Nanking and Wuhan, and perhaps the most heavily fortified defensive position along the river in Chinese hands. Chinese defenders held out against murderous Japanese bombardment until June 27.
