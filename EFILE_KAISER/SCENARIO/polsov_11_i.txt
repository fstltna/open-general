Back to Minsk

October 9th, 1920

As a consequence of the peace talks that are taking place in Riga, it seems that a ceasefire is imminent. In a few days Poland and Soviet Russia will sign an armistice and the military operations will end. 

I know that your troops are exhausted, but you must make the most of the time that we have left. Continue your march to the east, towards the city of Minsk. Your objective isn't the city itself, but the roads, the railway lines, and the strategic towns surrounding Minsk. That will help us to get more concessions from the Reds at the negotiation table.

Victory conditions: Take all VHs.

Intelligence report: After their defeat at the Niemen River, the Russians have few units left. Most of them are regrouping in the main towns, where they hope to offer a fierce resistance until the ceasefire comes.
Gen. Bulak-Balachowicz's unit of White Russians sided with Poland some months ago. They are resupplying near your HQ so you could use some of their troops if you need their help.

Good luck!

Note: You can buy White Russian units in this scenario.
