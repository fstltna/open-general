December 19th, 1954
New York, New York
-----------------------------------
Commander, what started as a simple riot has escalated into a true life or death situation for the Union.   The rebs have obviously infilitrated the protests with their own provocateurs, and their troops have moved in to occupy the majority of Brooklyn.

While your defeat of the enemy division surrounding D.C. bought us some time, we're still on the edge of a precipice here.  The main Soviet fleet is due to arrive in force any time now, and when they do they'll bring the firepower their rebel lackeys so sorely need.   If the Soviets establish a beachhead here in New York, the war is lost.

The local National Guard forces are holding northern Brooklyn, but they won't be able to maintain their positions for long.  Take your force, secure Staten Island, then cross the bay and push to liberate the city's defenders.

Naval forces are en route.  Keep an eye out for any Russian ships, and prepare to sink Ivan's transports if you spot them.

Godspeed, Commander.  Carter out.

SCENARIO NOTES:
* Hold at least 10 victory hexes to win.
* Use the ports on Staten Island to carry your core force into downtown New York.
