Wilna, Sept 13, 1915

Gospodin General-Leitenant, the German VI Cavalry and XXI Army Corps have poured into a breach between our 10th and 5th Armies to the north of Wilna and are threatening to envelop the bulk of the 10th Army!  You must stop this maneuver and hold Wilna.  The forces under your command include the elite Guard Corps and the I Cavalry Corps.  General Smirnov (2nd Army) has sent the XXXVI Corps to your aid as well.

While the numbers of experienced troops - formed before the war - diminishes daily at an alarming rate, the fresh 2nd and 3rd line divisions lack sufficient training to be as dependable in the field.  The ammunition shortage has compounded the problem.  Only your skillful leadership can hold the front together, Gospodin General!
