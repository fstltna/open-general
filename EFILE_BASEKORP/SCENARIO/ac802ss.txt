Good morning General, I hope you thaw from the trip most quickly.

We have a most interesting opportunity to destroy two Soviet divisions and significantly cement my Finnish People to the crusade against communism.  

My Finnish troops have cut supply to the Russians in Suomussalmi.  While you were traveling, fresh Soviet forces have started a drive to re-open their supply lines and save their comrades.

I know your troops are stiff from the cold and their long travel to get here, but we must launch our attack to destory these forces immediately.  The heat of battle will warm our blood!

STAFF INTEL: This will be a hard fight General, the winter cold and the huge tanks the Russians have will make this a tough battle.  We should make sure to keep our units at near full strength for anything may happen in the snows.
