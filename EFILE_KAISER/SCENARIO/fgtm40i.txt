Arkhave-Vize, 23 January 1916

Gospodin General,
During the year 1915 our allies in the west met stalemate. Our own North-Western Front has retreated but held the German offensive. Our South-Western Front in Galicia met a devastating Germano-Austrian blow and retreated deep into our territory. In the Middle East two fronts, in Egypt and Mesopotamia, have pitted British and Ottoman forces. In the Kavkaz mountains a Turkish offensive had shattered against our army.
In 1916 the Entente Alliance plans to bring this war to a conclusive end:  a French offensive at Verdun has been planned for February. The success of our Kavkaz Front has enabled a strategic push against Turkey's presence in the Kavkaz Mountains: a line that stretches from the coast of the Black Sea to the mighty fortress of Erzerum. The offensive's first action will be a diversionary attack against the Arkhave-Vize section of the Turkish line on the shore of the Black Sea. You will command the Primorsky Otriad (Liakhov).
You will be able to deploy 3 units for an amphibious assault. Only specially trained infantry (Morskaya Pekhota) will be deployable with the fleet. The rest of your forces will assume command of the II Turkestansky Corps outside of Arkhave.

We fight for the Tsar, Gospodin General!
