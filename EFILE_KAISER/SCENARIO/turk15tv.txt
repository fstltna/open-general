The Battle of Jerusalem  - tactical victory

We have withdrawn successfully ....

Historical outcome 
By December 1, the fighting for Jerusalem was almost over.
Eleven Ottoman infantry divisions had been forced to retire, suffering 28,443 casualties. some 12,000 prisoners were captured. Besides, 100 guns and scores of machine guns were also taken.
The EEF's campaign from October to December of 1917 resulted in a military defeat of the Central Powers, which led to a substantial loss of enemy territory. In particular, the fighting from October 31 to November 7 against the Ottoman Gaza- Sheria- Beersheba line resulted in the first defeat of the entrenched, experienced and, up until then, successful Ottoman armies, which were supported by artillery, machine guns and aircraft. During these attacks the Ottoman defenders were well established in trenches, redoubts and other fortifications, requiring a "Western Front"-style of battle, as the attackers were forced to approach across open ground.
