Tannenberg: To lose an army

August 27, 1914

"The Czar trusted me.  How can I face him after such a disaster?" - General Samsonov, 29th August, 1914

Following the success of Rennekampf's 1st Army to the north, General Samsonov's 2nd Army began its maneuver with the aim of cutting off the German path of retreat toward the Vistula River.  Under the impression, given by Rennekampf's reconnaisance, that the German 8th Army was in full retreat, Samsonov plunged his army into Eastern Prussia.

The German 8th Army had undergone a crisis in August:  following the Russian victories at Stalluponen and Gumbinnen, General von Prittwitz prepared the army for retreat behind the Vistula and was ready to abandon the fortress of Königsberg to a Russian siege.  Unsatisfied with Prittwitz's unwillingness to engage the enemy on German soil, the German Supreme Command replaced him with the retired General von Hindenburg, while tranferring the conqueror of Liege - Ludendorff - to serve as his Chief of Staff.  While en route by rail, Ludendorff and Hindenburg devised a parrying maneuver for the 8th Army:  while screening Rennekampf's advance with cavalry and Landwehr forces, to strike Samsonov's flanks with the maximum force, defeat the 2nd Army, and then bring the 8th Army to face Rennekampf's advance.

There were two key advantages the German army possessed in order to execute this plan:  first, the rail network in Eastern Prussia was extensive and could allow for the rapid transfer of two army corps within days, and second, interceptions of the Russian wireless and unencrypted communications between Stavka and both field armies gave German intelligence information on the dispositions and intentions of the Russian units.

Entraining von Francois' I Corps and transferring it to strike at Samsonov's south-western flank and turning the I Reserve and XVII Corps to face the advancing 2nd Army, Hindenburg set the trap.  Fully aware of the danger of leaving the 8th Army's flank exposed to Rennekampf, Hindenburg made a gamble with extremely high stakes on his intercepted intelligence.  Meanwhile, Rennekampf's cavalry failed to discover the German intentions.  Observing the rapid retreat of the I Corps, elated with his victory at Gumbinnen, and concerned about the lengthened and strained supply lines, Rennekampf did not hurry the advance of his army, choosing instead to allow the retreating Germans to stumble onto the advancing 2nd Army.  Similarly lacking good field intelligence, Samsonov was not aware of the German reorganization and issued orders in preparation for chasing the enemy to the Vistula.

When von Francois' Corps, reinforced by a motley of Landwehr units and batallions from other divisions, struck the Russian I Corps on Samsonov's left, the flank collapsed.  On his right, the VI Corps failed to even engage the enemy, retreating in near panic - often mistaking its own cavalry for pursuing German Uhlanen. The bulk of the 2nd Army thus became trapped in a cauldron in the forests east of the village of Tannenberg.  The arrival of the 1st Army's II Corps was too little and too late to save Samsonov from tragedy.  Refusing to leave his army, Samsonov remained in command while encircled.  Utterly defeated and having issued the order for scattered units to disengage and retreat, Samsonov committed suicide while retreating with his staff.

The battle was a brilliant German victory:  Russia suffered 92,000 prisoners, over 30,000 casualties, and the XV and XIII Corps were erased from existence.  Ludendorff named the engagement after the village of Tannenberg in compensation for the defeat of Teutonic Knights by a Slavic alliance of Lithuanian, Polish, and Russian warriors in 1410 AD.
