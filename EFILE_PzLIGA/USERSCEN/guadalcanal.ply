Guadalcanal

Since the 7th of december 1941 the Empire of Japan is in war with the United Staates. Quick successes of the japanese forces has enlarged their area of influence multiple times. But the Defeat at Midway was a decisive turning-point in the pacific war. Without the hardly needed air superiority, which had former been secured by carriers, the imperial army is forced in the defence.
The first battle of the american counter-attack takes place here on Guadalcanal.
