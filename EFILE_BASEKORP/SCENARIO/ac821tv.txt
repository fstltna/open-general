Marshall!

Italy has many dark days yet to come.

Your forces managed, although barely, to push the Allied forces back to the beaches at Salerno, however they're second effort again pushed our forces from the beaches.  Peace talks have turned into surrender negotiations, but should still bring a cease fire and we hope to sign peace within days.  

You and your forces will formally surrender as soon as the peace treaty is signed, and tragically, Germany is already moving through the alps to occupy northern Italy.  We must now safe guard our resources for the Allies in a hope that they can move north quickly stop the Germans from moving farther south than they already have.   The Allies have been given safe passage while the negotiations continue.  

Also, tell your men that there is talk that the Allies are entertaining an Allied Italian corps to fight the Germans up north..............
