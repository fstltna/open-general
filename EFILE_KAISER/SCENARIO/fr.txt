The new Republic is determined to do anything to restore the glory of France, lost in the disaster of 1870. We'll expand our dominions all over the world and, as soon as we have a chance, be sure that we'll take revenge on the Germans.

We'll need skillful officers to complete that goal. Jean-Babtiste Bertaux-Levillain, we know your service record, and we think that you can be one of those men. Are you willing to serve your homeland whenever and wherever she needs you? Are you willing to make Germany pay for the humiliation that they inflicted on France? We know you are. You won't regret this chance. Fight for your country and bring it back to greatness. Ils ne passeront pas!
