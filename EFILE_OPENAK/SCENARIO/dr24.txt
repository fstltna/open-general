March to Limoges - June 1944

Our division has now been fully withdrawn from Russia to Montauban/Toulouse in France and is renamed to SS Panzer Division "Das Reich". Our main concern is the large number of fresh troops (9000) in Das Reich - we even had to accept conscripts to fill our ranks.

The Allies landed in Normandy June 6 1944, 2 days ago. Yesterday preparations were made to come to march readiness. Today we are moving out. First stop is the Limoges-Tulle area. We will travel there in two columns. Be aware of partisan attacks. Resistance activity has increased considerably over the last few days throughout France.
