El Alamein

Part 1/3 of the "Afrika" minicampaign


"Welcome back to Africa, my friend! How was your flight?

Meine Herren, for those who do not not this gentlemen: let me introduce you Generalmajor Otto Bistroff, who'll be your superior either for the rest of the campaign, or until I return. But as I know him, the latter seems unlikely and you will capture Cairo before I even fully check in to the sanatorium. No, no, Otto, please be silent and don't spoil me this moment! Let everybody know how I value your skill and experience... while many of the morons of OKH think otherwise.

But back to business! Herr Generalmajor, it seems like the Brits knew of your coming and they've prepared a pretty hot welcome for you. For weeks they're improving their positions, they're moving more and more men and resources and it is obvious that a big offensive is about to start in coming days. Our air recon confirmed a large concentrations of enemy armour, so we've arranged accordingly. But as the enemy air activity increases rapidly with every hour, it is more and more hard for us to gain new solid informations.

Together with our Italian allies we've built a strong defensive line with minefields, bunkers and artillery positions. Once the British attack loses its power, we can easily rout them. But to accomplish this task, we must first get rid of their armoured units. Destroy their tanks and the attack will crumble."


Victory conditions: Destroy all enemy armoured vehicles marked as "Must Survive Unit" or capture all VHs.

Hint: Use terrain to your advantage... or at least don't let the enemy use it to his advantage.
The faster you try to win the war in the air, the faster you'll... lose it. Allied airforce is very powerful.
Don't expect any reinforcements. The battle is at its high and both sides already moved in the reserves...
