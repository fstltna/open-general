Battle in the Ardennes
In what the Germans failed once we now want to success. In the Ardennes the allied have build the last defensive line. If we can manage a breakthrough the way to Antwerpen will be free and the allied troops can no longer use the harbor of Antwerpen for reinforcements. 
Your troops:
An army will support your attack. A unit of Josef Stalin tanks will assist you, too.
Enemy troops:
The allied troops are still numerous. Beware of assaults in the woody terrain. I remind you, that Josef Stalin tanks only have a few ammunitions and they are vulnerable in this terrain.
