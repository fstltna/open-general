 VICTORY
--------------------------------
Congratulations, General! The Turkish plan to disrupt the Canal traffic has failed due to your good leadership. The few Turks that were able to reach the western shore have either been killed or captured. Your counter-attack drove them back into the desert, and they have started a withdrawal across the Sinai to Beersheba. At the moment we don't have the means to pursue them, but after this heavy defeat I am sure the Turks will not dare to attack again in the near future.
