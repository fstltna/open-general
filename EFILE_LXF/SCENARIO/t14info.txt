You have made the decision to attack Suez at the southern end of the Suez Canal. The Allied forces off course know we are approaching. They have left behind numerous roadblocks and machine gun batalions to slow us down in the open desert. This gave them time to bring troops to the Suez Canal and prepare their defences. But don't let me get you down. Your men are still superb veterans of this war and your tactical skills will make the differance. Good luck and do not let things happen like the tragedy of 1914.
