02. PRUT RIVER (2 July 1941)

To the commanding officer of 22. ID (LL):

Operation Barbarossa has commenced a few days ago. Your division, part of 11. Armee, is stationed on the Bessarabian front to support the Rumanian offensive into Russia. We expect you to co-operate with the Rumanian divisions as you will with our own 76. Infanterie Division.

Your first objective will be the crossing of the Prut river. After securing a bridgehead you must expand it by pushing east to north-east in the direction of Drochia. The Soviets will most likely not be totally surprised by our attack yet experiences on other sectors of the front have shown that the Soviet forces are not up to their task.


RULES: 
- Do not upgrade, sell or buy units - nor upgrading transports.
- Replacing lost units by buying new units is allowed. Replacements should be the exact same unit as the lost unit.
