Herr General,

You have again stopped very powerfull forces attempting to conquer your positions ! Meanwhile, Manstein has moved up troops and armoured divisions to launch a counterattack that will decide the fait of sixth army and with it the future of our empire.

We thought it sensible to let your battered troops stay put for a few days. After that you will have to move to the Italian sector of the front to stand in for the armoured division that participates in our counteroffensive
