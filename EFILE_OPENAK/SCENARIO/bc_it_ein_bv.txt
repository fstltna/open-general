BRILLIANT VICTORY

Excellent showing, sir!  Despite the rather madcap nature of Montgomery's cunning plan, you still somehow managed to achieve your objectives - and in good time!  Unfortunately, due to the heavy casualties suffered by our airborne chaps, the lack of supplies and the German counter-attacks bearing down on our flanks, we have little chance of exploiting this breakthrough.  The war won't be over by Christmas it now appears.
