Good morning Kapteeni, the Soviets have been attacking in this sector for hours and we've already lost Petsamo.  
Situation report: You have to raise a battle group and destroy the enemy concentrations in the Nautsi area. Stop the Soviets and stabilize the situation (hex 04,26; 04,31; 04,35).  
Enemy: We recognize the 104th Mountain division and expect the 52nd Rifle division to arrive shortly. The Soviets are already digging in, while their Scouts are reported to be infiltrating the Nautsi-area.  
Our forces: There's a group (Os Pennanen) with some old guns on the Arctic road. Your staff is already in the area.

Good luck!

Kenraalimajuri Tuompo, CIC Northern Finland Group
