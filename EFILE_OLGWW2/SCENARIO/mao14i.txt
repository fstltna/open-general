Spring Offensive [Korean War]

22-4-1951 Seoul, near the 38th Paralell.

It's time to go back to Seoul.  We have deployed a large number of PLA and KPA units Northwards toward Seoul and with your armies nothing will stop us in our drive.  The South Korean capital must be in our hands again.

The UN forces have massed their units to protect their silly so-called ''No-Named line''.  Anyway, this situation fits perfectly with our People's War doctrine.  Launch your armies and over run the dirty capitalist's invaders on your way to recapture Seoul.
