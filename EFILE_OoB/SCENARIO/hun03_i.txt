April 11, 1941

After the collapse of the pro-German regime in Yugoslavia, Wehrmacht launched the invasion of the country on April 7, 1941. The independent state of Croatia was proclaimed on April 10, and under the pretext of protecting the Hungarian minority, the Governor ordered your troops to cross the borders and retake Bácska (Voivodina). Some German divisions will help you.

HQ has approved the expansion of your forces to include a Bomber detachment.

NOTE: You have 19 DHs. Take all VHs!
