For your excellent leadership, you have been appointed as the commander of our combined land, naval, and air assault on Norway, code named Operation Weserubung. Your goal is to capture all objectives in southern and central Norway by May 3rd. Your forces must be free to redeploy for the upcoming campaign in France which is slated to begin May 10th. You should complete your mission as early as you can. This will allow us a greater chance to rest, refit and upgrade your troops prior to the invasion of France.
