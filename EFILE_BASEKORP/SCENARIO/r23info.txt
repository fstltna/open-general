23. FALCIU 3 (22 August 1944)

After months of preparations, we have invaded Rumania. The biggest ally of the German cowards that invaded our country. Like our offensives in the Baltic and Byelorussia, we have made promising advances. From our bridgehead over the Prut River at Jassy and at a number of other places, we have broken fascist lines and are driving deep into their rear. If we could join two of our pincers near Falciu, at the Prut River, then we can cut of a considarable number of fascist troops. 

Your force is coming from Rumanian soil, on the west side of the Prut River, down south to Falciu. Other forces will try to cross the Prut River from the area south of Kishenev. Be quick and make sure those fascists get caught. I believe you are familiar with this region, comrade. Good luck.
