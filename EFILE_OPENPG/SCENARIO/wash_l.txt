Dateline Berlin - August 15, 1945. The war is over. A peace agreement between the United States and Germany is signed. Our armed forces failure to capture Washington, D.C., and the use by the United States on August 6th of an atomic bomb are the reasons cited for the peace accord. We are pleased peace has come but are sorry to report that the commander of the invasion forces is confirmed killed alongside his troops in the atomic explosion. He will long be remembered as one of history's greatest military minds in the hearts of our people for his contribution to peace.
