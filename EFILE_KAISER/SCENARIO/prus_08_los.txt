Although the French had a tactical victory at Gravelotte, they couldn't exploit their success. Unable to keep its positions, the Army of the Rhine retreated to Metz the next morning, and the Germans besieged the city almost immediately. In a matter of weeks most of Bazaine's units had been destroyed or had been trapped in Metz where, unless they received some kind of help, would eventually have to surrender.

Aware of this, Napoleon III and Marshall MacMahon raised the new Army of Châlons in order to march towards Metz and rescue Bazaine. With Napoleon III personally leading it, the Emperor and MacMahon guided the Army of Châlons to the northeast. The plan was to surprise the Germans, sneak behind their right flank, near the frontier with Belgium, and then turn to the south and liberate Metz.
