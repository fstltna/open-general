Battle of the Denmark Strait - May 21st, 1941

More German ships need to leave port to raid British shipping. The surface ships available now are the battleship Bismarck, the pocket battleship Graf Spee and the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen. These three ships have been put under your command. We just passed the Denmark Strait - North of Iceland - and have been detected by British cruisers that are now shadowing us. Try to escape to the Atlantic.
