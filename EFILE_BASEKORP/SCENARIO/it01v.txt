ON TO SIDI BARRANI September 1940 V

This advance is pushing our organisational talents to the limit, but we advanced 60 miles into Egypt with only light casualties. Only 300 miles to go to Alexandria.

Next stop is Mersah Matruh - 80 miles East of your curent position.

HISTORY
The British retreated to buy time and reinforcements. After 4 days and 60 miles inside Egypt, Graziani stops his attack due to supply logistics. To risk going any farther, Graziani said, would risk being defeated until supplies were available. 
Promised reinforcements were diverted to Greece and Graziani was forced to change his attack plan and could not penetrate deeper than Sidi Barrani.
