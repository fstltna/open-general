Halen - Battle of the Silver Helmets - August 12th 1914

With Liege in our hands, our First, Second and Third Armee are pouring into Belgium. The Belgian 4th infantry division is defending Namur while the other 5 infantry divisions - including the 3rd that got hit hard at Liege - have taken position behind the river Gete. Their northern flank is covered by the 1st Cavalry Division of General de Witte. The division is positioned around Halen. 
Our 2nd and 4th Kavallerie divisions are to cross the Gete at Halen and to move to Diest via Zelk. If this plan succeeds, the Belgian army will be forced to retreat to avoid getting cut off from its supply base at Antwerp.

Player Notes:
Only 5 core gound units and no air units can be deployed in this scenario.
