The british have taken Tanga. Your position is desperate and you must surrender your army.

Historically, after a hard fight, the germans stopped the british attack and forced them to reembark leaving more than 800 casualties, against about 50 dead in the german side. Also many war supplies were abandoned: enough english rifles to equip three askari companies, 600.000 rounds and 16 machineguns. Besides, the native soldiers learned that they could defeat an european army. The defeat cost Major-General Aitken his command.
