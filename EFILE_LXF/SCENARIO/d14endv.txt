VICTORY

Operation Crow has been a full succes too. Java is ours and the main leaders of the Republic of Indonesia have been captured. The Dutch Army, which includes you, could do more for the Dutch cause!

AFTERMATH:
Operation Crow, the so-called Second Police Action, was a succes at first but the consequences were fully against Dutch interest. The international opinion turned against the Netherlands. With the United States threatening to stop the economic help, the Marshall Plan, the Netherlands gave in and signed the Indonesian independance on 30 December 1949.
