Düppeler Schanzen

Apr 18th, 1864

In February and March the Prussians and Austrians took most of Schleswig, and they even invaded Denmark. In the meantime, many Danish troops had taken defensive positions at the forts of Düppel. 

On March 15 the Prussian artillery started to fire at the Danish positions. The Danes were outnumbered, demoralized and lacked modern equipment and proper shelter. Their only advantage was the support of the Rolf Krake, a powerful Danish ironclad.
However, the Danish soldiers heroically resisted the Prussian attacks for more than one month. It was only on April 18 when the Prussian High Command decided that it was time for the final assault.
