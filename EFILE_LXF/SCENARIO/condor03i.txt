Battle of Brunete - July 6th, 1937

Herr Oberstleutnant, to relieve the pressure on both the few remaining forces in the North and on Madrid, the Republicans have launched a major offensive at Brunete. Republican success would cut the supply lines to Nationalist troops besieging Madrid and would force them to withdraw. Again General Franco needs you to stop this Republican offensive, Beware of the Republican's new Russian tanks! Multiple divisions will reinforce your forces the next few hours and days.
