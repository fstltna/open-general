BRILLIANT VICTORY

You have done a very good job, comrade. The fascists had more reserves than expected, including an entire tank division. Although you have shifted the frontline to the west, no breakthrough has taken place. On the other hand, the enemy was not able to destroy the Novorossiysk bridgehead either. We are locked in a stalemate. We will stop offensive actions and assemble forces for a new offensive that should commence after some months.
