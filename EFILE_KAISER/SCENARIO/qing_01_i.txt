Núi Bop

Jan 3rd, 1885

The Chinese didn't retreat too far. Keeping some advanced positions in the Luc Nam valley was indispensable for the safety of Lang Son. In December the Guangxi Army occupied the hill of Núi Bop, east of Chu, where we started to build a fortified camp.

Lacking any kind of supply lines, we were forced to confiscate large ammounts of food and raw materials from the local villagers. Not surprisingly, they resented our actions, and they started to see the French as potential saviours. Soon they alerted our enemies to our presence.

The French quickly launched an offensive against Núi Bop. But instead of making a frontal assault from Chu, they decided to outflank the Chinese lines. Their plan consisted in marching along the southern bank of the Luc Nam river and then fording it, near the Chinese left. It was a daring move, that actually managed to surprise us. Our only hope was to resist the initial charges and counterattack as soon as possible.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.

Special note:
- The unit that takes the French camp will obtain a leader.
