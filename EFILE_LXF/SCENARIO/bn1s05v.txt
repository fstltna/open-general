General Wilhelm List

Good work, Lieutenant Colonel! You caught a large part of the British Expeditionary force. You are promoted to Colonel and have been given command over the new Air landing Storm Regiment. My congratulations, Colonel! There is a rumour that a large military operation is being planned.
