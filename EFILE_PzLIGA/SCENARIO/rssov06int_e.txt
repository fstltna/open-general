Southern Karafuto

August, 1944

After your success in the Xingkai lake, the Kwantung army wants you to manage the retreat from the Karafuto island, the bolsheviks have invaded that island with strong units, and for the moment we can't mantain our positions there while our fleets are fighting the americans on the Pacific.

Establish defensive positions, and stop the soviets while other sectors are completing the retreat, then, drive your units to the evacuation point. One more thing, commander. Many of the people living on the North, have abandoned their houses fearing the soviet invasion. Now, you are responsible for the refugees and their lives on your sector, all of them must survive since the High Command would not accept to lost any of the refugee groups. Due to the refugees matter, all the room on the evacuation fleet it's full. Don't loose any of the transports, or the High Command will relief you.

Kitto-kattsu general.

[Defensive Scenario Info.] At least 10 of your units must reach the Red hexe on the port, this includes the 5 refugee groups, that must survive, as well as the 3 naval transports on the port. The High Command will considere to give you more prestige if you can resist until the Tactical Victory turns. In this case, a Tactical Victory is a TV for the soviets, and a Brilliant Victory for you.
