In less than a month you've finished the war in the Balkans. King Alexander has forced the resignation of the government and the exile of the pro-British Prime Minister Venizelos. He's also assured us that Greece will accept our peace terms.

Right now the remnants of the French, Serbian and Italian forces just care about embarking to Corfu, Kreta or Brindisi. And without the Greek support the British units at Thessaloniki will have to choose between evacuation or surrender. It'll still take some weeks, maybe months, to fully clear Greece of enemies, but it's undeniable that this has been one of our finest victories in the war. Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria are safe now, and we'll be able to send thousands of soldiers to the Western front. We can even afford transferring some battalions to the Middle East in order to help our Ottoman allies.

Now you must go to Italy as fast as you can. Our offensive in Trient has broken the enemy lines, but we need your help to exploit the initial success.
