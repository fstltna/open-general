Unbelievable! You've been defeated by the Romanian Army! The Bulgarians have showed more reliability than your own forces. Thanks to the Bulgarians we'll still be able to pacify this front before Christmas, but you...you are of no use to us right now. You'd better go back to the Western Front. And please, General, remain there.
