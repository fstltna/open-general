[Leaders]
-Position a Tank with Overwatch leader in an area where the enemy is likely to move to.
-Flak Support leader allows the unit to do multiple Intercepts and also give Support Fire to ground units at range 1.
-Forest Camouflage leader allows the unit to become invisible when located in forest terrain; any enemy ground unit entering it's ZOC is subject to a surprise contact.
