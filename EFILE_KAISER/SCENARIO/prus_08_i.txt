Gravelotte

Aug 18th, 1870

The Germans knew that there wasn't any time to lose. They wanted to destroy the Army of the Rhine before the French could react. Just two days after Mars-la-Tour they attacked their enemies again, along the Gravelotte-Sankt Privat line, less than 10 Km west of Metz, where Bazaine's forces had built a defensive position.
However, this time the Prussian III and X Corps weren't going to engage in battle. They were still very exhausted from the previous fight at Mars-la-Tour, and they needed time to recover. That gave the French a small chance of success, despite their numerical inferiority.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.

Special note:
- You can buy equipment from Saxony in this scenario.
