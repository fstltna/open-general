Belarus

Part 1/3 of the "Ostfront" minica

Overall info: (Somewhere in USSR.) After weeks of heavy fighting, the Germans penetrate deeper and deeper to the East, but the flow of fresh enemy units seems to be endless and once again, the Russians have stopped the brigade.
The enemy holds a firm defense line along the river line. Although the Soviets are badly trained and lead, although their morale is low, their equipment is a quality one. 
More and more of their excellent tanks show up every day. Here they concentrated some fifty of them, including the fearsome T-34s and KVs. This will be the first time our brigade encounters them. 


Victory condition: Capture all VHs.
