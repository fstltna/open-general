Mozhaisk
Final attack on Moscow. The Winter war in Soviet union is very hard
Battle Hell in Eastern front.
We have a chance for victory over Red army, but enemy resistence will be very strong. Soviet units from Siberia are hard.Bad weather,the severe frost,difficult trackless ground... It is Soviet battlefield.
