Kunming

July, 1942

After the fall of Burma, the British will be busy for a long time! hahaha.  The Burma Road will no longer be the life line for our old Chinese enemies.  The Chinese supplies are running out quickly and now it's time to begin the end for the Chinese campaign at once.  We should take advantage of this opportunity!  Your mission is to capture Kunming, one of the latest supply depots the Chinese still hold.  This won't be easy because the mountain terrain will allow the dirty Chinese to ambush us every step of the way, but we count on you once again to complete this mission.
