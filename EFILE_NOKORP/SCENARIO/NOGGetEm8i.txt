Tanks against tanks - We're back to more conventional foes.
Beware though, those tanks are as good as yours, and your opponent has more than you.

Also, the terrain has no cover at all: It's a uniform flat plain without a single tree. You can run, but you can't hide.

There are 4 Bonus Bunkers this time, but will you have the time to crack them all open? This scenario isn't too long, keep an eye on the turn count.

You also get another freebie, another sturdy recon plane.
