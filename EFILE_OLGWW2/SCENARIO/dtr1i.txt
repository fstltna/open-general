Herr General, we have underestimated the Bolsheviks' powers of resistance. They have crossed the Don and completely encircled Sixth Army. You must drive on Kletskaya and Serafimov to reestablish contact. We will never, never surrender to the Red Army, but in order for us to hold our position, you must prevail. Good Luck.
