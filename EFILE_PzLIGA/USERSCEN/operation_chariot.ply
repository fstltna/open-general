Operation Chariot

On March 28, 1942, British commando units intrude into the Loire estuary in order to destroy the strategically important Normandy Dock in the seaport of St. Nazaire.
The Allies are worrying about a sortie of the battleship Tirpitz into the Atlantic.

Only this one dry-dock has the right size to take up the Tirpitz outside of Germany. If it is destructed, an Atlantic sortie of the Tirpitz is no more to be expected due to the lack of maintenance and repair facilities.

Additional important objectives are the local U-Boot facilities.
