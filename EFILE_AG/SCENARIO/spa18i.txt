Historical:
Spartacus encountered the strong forces of Crassus at Paestum. It is told, that he killed his own horse while saying, that if they would lose today, he wouldn`t need one anymore and, if they would win, he would have more Horses then he could ever need. He personally lead the attack on the roman Camp. The heroic, but because of the secession of the Celts weakened Slaves were defeated by the heavily superiority of Crassus. Only a few survived. Crassus gave order to crucify 6.000 captured Slaves along the Via Appia towards Rome. The fate of Spartacus is unknown, even the romans were not able to find his dead body or identify him underneath the captives. By this, the Trakian disappeared as shrouded in mystery as he had risen from it in the past, to shock the foundations of the triumphant Rome and to defeat several roman armys.
