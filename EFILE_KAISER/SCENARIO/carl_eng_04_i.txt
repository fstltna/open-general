Santoña

May 16th, 1874

(Fictional scenario)

Before heading south and taking Madrid it is imperative that we control the communications between Santander and Bilbao. All republican attempts to break our siege, by land and sea, came from the Montaña. If we go south without caution the enemy might try again, attacking our rear and breaking our lines of supply.Our army would be in the middle of Castilla isolated, doomed to failure!
Your mission will be to ensure that this does not happen. This time you will be without the support of other units, since all of them are occupying strategic positions in Álava to prepare our progress towards Burgos. Also the enemy will employ veteran units stationed in Santander and Santoña. But we have full confidence in your talent in combat.Good Luck!

Victory conditions: Take all the VHs.

Notes: - The unit that takes Santoña will win a leader.
            - The unit that enters Arredondo will win +100 pex.
            - From now on the new units that you buy will  begin with 120 pex.
