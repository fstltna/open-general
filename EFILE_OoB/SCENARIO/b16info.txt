16. HARI (2 June 1945)

East, east, east! After the Hongorai River lies the Hari River, the first of four rivers holding us back from storming Buin! Australian troops have crossed the Hongorai River at three points. From these points further advances need to be made. If the northern advance, along the Commando Road, is highly succesfull, it would become possible to let this force turn south and cut the Buin Road east of Hari and cut off Japanese troops at Hari. However in the south, a general attack east will also be executed with the goal of capturing the village of Hari and secure a crossing over the Hari River. Good luck, General.
