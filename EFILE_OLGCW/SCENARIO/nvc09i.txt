Battle of Kontum

May, 1972

Continuing with our campaign of harassment on our southern capitalist enemies, the next step now is to strike the South Vietnam on their home soil! Since our ... successful ... Tet Offensive the foreign allies of the Saigon government have progressively disappeared from the battlefield. Just a couple of advisors are still present in Vietnam. The main danger from the foreign capitalist powers now comes from the air. Well, but let me explain to you what your next task is going to be. 

You are perfect for this operation since you already know the area around Kontum province. This operation is to attack and capture the provincial capital city of Kontum. The problem involves the enemy ''fire bases''.  They are fortified positions between the Laotian frontier and the outskirts of Kontum city. Take all of these fire bases and then attack Kontum. You will receive support from Regional Viet Cong units. Also, the B3 Front has deployed some AA emplacements near the fire bases, as an ''AA umbrella'' to protect your attack on the enemy fortified positions and yes we expect heavy enemy air attacks.

Chuc may man comrade.
