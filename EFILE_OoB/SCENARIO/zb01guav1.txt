Congratulations!  A Decisive Victory!

[Excellent start! 
Historically it was the Italians who were routed by the Republicans in this battle, the Republicans' best battlefield victory of the conflict.

From Wikipedia: 
"Franco's soldiers began singing popular Italian tunes with lyrical changes mocking the defeated CTV. The following chorus, originating with General Moscardó's Navarrese, humorously takes the Italians to task for their earlier complaints about the lack of motorized transport in Nationalist ranks:

Guadalajara no es Abisinia,
Los españoles, aunque rojos, son valientes,
Menos camiones y más cojones 

Guadalajara is not Abyssinia,
Spaniards, even the Red ones, are brave,
(You need) fewer trucks and more balls" ]
