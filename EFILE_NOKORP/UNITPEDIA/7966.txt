Fritz X (also known as Ruhrstahl SD 1400 X, Kramer X-1, PC 1400X or FX 1400) was a German radio guided anti-ship glide bomb. It's one of the forerunners of modern anti-ship missiles and precision-guided weapons.
Fritz X was an armour-piercing bomb intended to be used against armored targets such as heavy cruisers and battleships. At over 3 m length and over a ton weight, it could only be carried by bigger airplanes, and even those could only carry one at a time.
