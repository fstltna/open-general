Gospodin General-Major, your actions on the Shakhe River have cut down the Japanese attempt to regain the initiative.  Overrunning the Japanese 2nd Cavalry Brigade, Rennekampf's and Samsonov's cossacks engulfed the enemy positions from behind and decimated all plans of a Japanese advance any further.

General Kuropatkin is very pleased with the results and has begun preparations for an offensive toward Port Arthur.

The Russo-Japanese War was a highly embarassing conflict for Russia:  much more so for the Russian Navy.  After the Port Arthur squadron failed to escape and link up with the Vladivostok squadron (the Battle of the Yellow Sea, August 1904), Russia dispatched the Baltic Fleet around South Africa (to be coaled by German colliers en route!) to assault the Japanese fleet and to lift the blocade.  The Japanese, laying in ambush in the straits of Tsushima delivered a decisive blow to the fleet in May of 1905, dashing all hopes of relieving the besieged Port Arthur.  Signing the Treaty of Portsmouth in September of 1905, the Russian Empire relinquished its sphere of influence on the Korean peninsula and Manchuria.

Your tour of duty in the region has come to an end:  your assignment takes you back to the Motherland for strategic planning along the European frontier of the Empire.
