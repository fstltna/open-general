It has been a tremendous battle but our troops were exhausted and we couldn't take our objectives in time. The Red Army has taken heavy losses too so the Bolshevik government has sent us a peace offer that we are considering right now.
We are afraid that we'll finally have to accept the Curzon Line as the boundary between Poland and Red Russia. But after your poor performance at the battle of the Niemen River it's the best we can get.
