General,

It worked! While your attack across the Oder sucked away Russian forces, several panzer corps have marched on Posen and encircled Zjoekov's White Russian front with half a million soldiers!

The Russians have agreed to an armistice. 

[Player note: this armistice may only be temporary. As soon as good maps of Poland are available you will have to throw the Soviets out of Poland, Prussia and even Hungary!]
