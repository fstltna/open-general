
OPERATION BRASSARD - 17 JUN 1944

A major operation is planned for September to follow up the D-Day landings in Normandy with landings in southern France. Your Corps is soon to be taken off the Italian campaign to prepare for those landings, but in the meantime you have another operation; Operation Brassard.

The objective of Operation Brassard is to capture the islands of Elba and Pianosa, that control the sea between Corsica and the Italian mainland and which are still defended by significant German garrisons. The US army will provide air support and the British will provide naval support - but the land operation, apart from some British commandos, is almost exclusively French. You should use your best units to land small shock detachments and follow up with the main landings as soon possible. The Germans are aware of preparations for this assault, so do not expect to surprise them.

This operation is considered to be a test of you and your army's readiness for the landings in France.

GOAL: Take all VH's!
