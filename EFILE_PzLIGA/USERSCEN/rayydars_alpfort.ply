The Alps Fortress

US forces attack the Nazis' last retreat, the so-called Alpenfestung (Alps Fortress) in Austria.
While the Germans, supported by some Fascist Italian units, have saved their most modern weapons for this final battle, the allied forces are rather conventional but superior by number.
 
Victory conditions:
The Allies have to conquer the Alpenfestung (2 VHs).
The Axis cannot win in a PG2-like way because there is no accessible allied VH. As a special case, the Axis player is considered the winner if he just survives, i.e. if the Allies do not win. Thus a draw is not possible in this scenario. All or nothing!

History:
Of course this scenario is fictitious, for the Alpenfestung was nothing but a rumour spread by the SS. There had in fact been plans to build it - but no resources.
