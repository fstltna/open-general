Saint Quentin

Jan 19th, 1871

Finally, the end of the war was near. Just five days after the taking of Le Mans, on January 17th, the French Army of the East was defeated at the Lisaine River when they were trying to relieve Belfort. Paris couldn't resist longer than a few weeks without any help from the outside. Only the Army of the North remained as an able, although small, fighting force. Despite the loss of Amiens, Péronne and other strongholds, the French units, led by General Faidherbe, were still trying to save Paris. Eager to end the war once and for all, the Prussians sent their VIII Army Corps against them. Pretty soon, they found the French army near the town of Saint Quentin.
