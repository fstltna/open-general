VICTORY

Ras Desta's men were not, it seems expecting an attack. Their morale had been very high but the continued daily air raids, culminating on the day before the attack by a massive bombing raid of 50 Capronis, had sapped their spirit.

For one thing the Italian advance was halted in the Wadara forests. For all the ways of invading Ethiopia the southern route was the slowest and most arduous; and Graziani had never had any real intention, still less any orders, to push up through the wilds of Sidamo towards the central Lakes and then on to Addis Ababa.

Although the Italians advance had been held and a line was being fortified at Wadara, there were grave reports of dissension among the Sidamo leaders. There were the usual rumors of treachery, and the mutual accusations.

With desertions and dismissals the total strength of the army was down under 10,000 men and many of the Sidamo leaders were requesting a stronger leader.

So the Emperor sent Dejaz Gabremariam down from Dessie with orders, to reconcile the quarreling leaders and restore morale in Sidamo.
