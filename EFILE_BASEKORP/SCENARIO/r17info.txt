17. KRYMSKAYA (18 April 1943)

In the Kuban steppes the enemy is stronger than expected. After a month of ferious attacks we have not breached the fascist front. We have only advanced several miles, and the cities of Novorossiysk and Krasnodar are still in enemy hands.  However we must maintain pressure and eventually the German and Rumanian positions must crack. 

The fascists have started a counterattack to destroy our bridgehead near Novorossiysk, that you helped to form a month ago, and although we are holding on, we are about to crack. To draw away reserves, and to break through the fascist front in the center, we will attack near Krymskaya. Be aware that the Germans have reserves and will use it. On the other hand, we will commit as much forces as we can in order to force a breakthrough. Good luck, comrade.
