
BATTLE OF VITSI - 9 SEP 1948

South of Lake Kastoria, West Macedonia

Our last operation in the Grammos mountains was a bust! Most rebels escaped in the Vitsi region. Our job is now to prevent a renewed Redoubt in the Vitsi mountains and to destroy the escaped enemy forces. We plan a coordinated attack from the south and east to encircle the rebels. Your troops will lead the attack from the south and clean the area around the Lake Kastoria!

GOAL: Take all VHs!

NOTE: The unit occupying the town Dendrochori gets full replacements!

STORY: Most of the guerrillas that escaped from the GNA's Grammos operation assembled in the area surrounding Mount Vitsi. The Vitsi area offered good rebel supply routes coming out of Albania and Yugoslavia. The region's mountainous terrain favored a guerrilla stronghold defense. Both the GGS and JUSMAPG agreed that if the DAG forces were not expelled from the Vitsi area before winter, the rebels could hold out there well into the spring of 1949.

7 Elements of "B" Corps, under LTG Kitrilakis, advanced into the Vitsi area and prepared for an attack against the 4,500 guerrillas there. The plan was for the division to attack trom the south and from the east. The GGS expected "B" Corps to complete the operation in forty days.

The initial attack, begun on 30 August, started very slowly due to strong enemy resistance and bad weather. The GGS dispatched two additional brigades and another division headquarters to the region in an attempt to achieve a breakthrough. The attack gradually moved forward; on 5 September GNA units were within two kilometers of cutting off the rebel supply line to Albania.

The situation then changed quickly. DAG forces mounted a strong counterattack and forced the GNA "to retreat in disorder to their original positions." The GGS responded by dispatching another divisin to "B" Corps. Before "B" Corps could attack again, however, the rebels launched a spoiling attack that pushed GNA units back three kilometers. "B" Corps regained this ground after two days of fighting. 

General Van Fleet was not pleased. LTG Kitrilakis was the man Van Fleet had chosen to instill an aggressive spirit into "B" Corps. Now Kitrilakis' "cautious attitude" was destroying the GNA's chances of clearing the Vitsi region before winter. Van Fleet and the GGS agreed that Kitrilakis had to be relieved. Kitrilakis' replacement, however, could not produce victory either.

As "B" Corps prepared for another attack, DAG forces took advantage of the time available. The guerrillas continued to strengthen their defensive positions. Partly through the forced recruiting of villages in the area, the guerrillas' strength had grown to 7,000 by 1 October.

GNA forces launched two more major offensives in October. Both attempts were dismal failures, although the Commando Groups did record some sterling successes. By the month's end the GNA suspended any further offensives. The situation in Vitsi had ended in stalemate. DAG, now with a 6,500 man force, still controlled the region.

The American observers in Vitsi concluded that the Vitsi failure was due primarily to the lack of aggressive leadership in the GNA. Brigade and division commanders at times requested permission to withdraw when they met enemy resistance. At other times, GNA units retreated in disorder when DAG units counterattacked. One US officer concluded that GNA officers were either unwilling or unable to command their troops. Furthermore, simply relieving a commander did not solve the problem--"B" Corps had three commanders in three months.

As 1948 came to a close, there was little reason tor optimism. Wfile the GNA tried in vain to clear the Vitsi area, guerrilla bands increased their activities in the Thessaly and Peloponnese regions. The rate of forced recruiting replaced almost all of DAG's losses during the year. Therefore, despite suffering 24,000 casualties in 1948, DAG's overall strength was virtually the same as when the year began.
