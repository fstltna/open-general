Good work, General! Uman has fallen and our advance is going well. The Bolshevik armies in the heart of Ukraine are destroyed. Kiev will soon be encircled by Wehrmacht.

In the middle of July 1941, General Kleist's 1st Panzergruppe drove a wedge between Kiev and Vinnytsia. The German 17th and 11th Field Armies advanced to south of Uman. Stavka mistakenly assumed that the Germans were striving to reach the crossing of the Dnieper between Kiev and Cherkasy for a further offensive toward Donbass, and underestimated the danger of encirclement for their 6th and 12th Armies. On August 3, the encirclement was closed when the 1st Panzergruppe met with the German 17th Field Army and the Hungarian Mechanized Corps (Gyorshadtest). By August 8, the Soviet resistance had generally stopped. As the pocket was eliminated, the 1st Panzergruppe turned north on the orders to assist General Guderian's 2nd Panzergruppe in closing another encirclement around Kiev. Except the most rapid elements of the Gyorshadtest, Hungarian troops didn't participate in further battles in this year and returned to Hungary in October.
