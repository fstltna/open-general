Przemysl 1915, May 15 1915

Gospodin General-Leitenant, the war has once again returned to Przemysl.  After the Austrian garrison within the fortress capitulated in March of 1915, we have had barely two months to re-fortify the positions.  The breakthrough at Gorlice-Tarnow has forced the 3rd Army - while taking massive casualties - to retreat behind the San River.  The depleted III Kavkazky, XXIV, and XXI corps (numbering on average 1000 men per division) must fight this rear-guard action after 10 days of continuous fighting and German artillery bombardment.

The Austrian and German forces of the 11th Army have begun approaching Przemysl in three columns:  the Kneutzl Corps from the north-west, combined cavalry and infantry reserves from the west, and the Austrian X Corps in the south-west.  You must hold the fortress for as along as the South-Western Front command requires it.  You will be given clear orders to evacuate the battle field.
