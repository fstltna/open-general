Final Stage at Asturias

Orders from: Burgos, September, 1937

The Red army at Santander has been completely destroyed.  Only a few remnants have escaped to Asturias where they are now joined with the Asturian forces.  The enemy knows where to stop us in the mountains, but it's isolated.  The Republican government at Valencia can't send any kind of aid to the Asturians and it's just a matter of time until they are defeated.  However we must not allow the enemy to stage a heroic defense.  The winter in the mountains of Asturias is very hard and it will be the best ally for the Republicans.  Your task, mi General, is to get a quick and smashing victory.  Then, we will be able to turn our attention to the Aragon front.
