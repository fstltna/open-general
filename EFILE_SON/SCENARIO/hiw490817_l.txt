Ah, another captive so called “General”. Your gallows are waiting for you! You will hang next to the main schemer, Kossuth, ha-ha!

HISTORICAL NOTES: The encircled Hungarian strongpoints surrendered unconditionally during August and September. Only the surrender of the well defended Komárom was accepted with honorable terms on 4 Oct. 1849: the soldiers were not treated as prisoners of war and were allowed to go home after the demobilization of their units. Besides 20.000 defenders of Komárom, thousands of Hungarian soldiers were forced to enlist in the imperial army or went to the jail for years. Hundreds of officers were executed. On 6 October thirteen Hungarian generals and the first Hungarian prime minister were executed in Arad and Pest. This day became the Memorial Day in Hungary. The Governor Lajos Kossuth left Hungary near Orsova and moved to Turkey, England, France, USA and finally to Italy. He got a warm welcome by people of streets, but no government negotiated with him. He lived as a refugee until his death at 1894. Franz Joseph never pardonned him, and Kossuth never accepted the compromise of Austrian and Hungarian nations concluded in 1867.
