VICTORY

---The Adriatic Sea is once cleared from enemy activity. Your force was vital to supress partisan activity in the region for at least months!

The equipement of your Marines is getting outdated. The Fuhrer has given orders to deliver '43 standard material for your Marine Corps! Return to Germany for the refitting.

Back in Germany, the popularity of the Marine Corps has grown and a special Marine Corps School has been opened in the port of Kolberg where new Marines will be trained. So from now you can count on new units with experience.

For your actions you have been promoted to Generaladmiral!---
