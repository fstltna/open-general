Your victory has been, without any doubt, crucial for the future of our Empire. Romania has sued for peace, and the Russian revolutionaries have suffered a blow from which they won't recover, especially since the Germans have also taken Riga, in the Baltic. I wouldn't be surprised if, in the following months, Russia fell into chaos and the Bolsheviks took power. In the short term that would be good for us. The war at the Eastern front would be over, and we could send more troops to the west, where we need them desperately.

So far, our armies have been able to reject a dozen Italian assaults in the Isonzo Valley, but our casualties are too high. If we don't help them, sooner or later that entire front will collapse. Fortunately, it seems that the Germans want to help us in our struggle against Italy. That will be an excellent chance to get rid of the Italians, and you are the right man for the task.
