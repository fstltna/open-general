After months of war we all know how tough and brave the Filipinos are, but anyway there's no excuse for this. It's a shame that you've allowed an army of peasants armed with knives and some old rifles to defeat you.

I wish that you retired and lived as a civilian for the rest of your life, but there are different orders for you. You must go with a small contingent of troops to China, where the anti-western movement has grown increasingly violent. We must send some soldiers to protect the Americans who live there, as well as their possessions. You'll have another chance and  I'll get rid of you, so we both win.
