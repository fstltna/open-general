1939-45 ROYAL NAVY

Test your skills as Admiral and fight for the British Royal Navy in the Atlantic and Mediterranean naval battles of the Second World War.
This is an historic campaign that mainly deals with the sea battles in the Mediterranean between 1941-43. You starts modestly, as a flotilla commander with some small destroyers for escort duty and submarine hunting which you developed into a powerful destroyer flotilla. Later you take command of a small fleet of destroyers, cruisers and battleships that can deal with any opponent at sea.

Enjoy!
