THE KUOMINTANG

The Kuomintang (KMT), often referred to in English as the Nationalist Party of China or Chinese Nationalist Party (CNP), is a major political party in the Republic of China in Taiwan, based in the city of Taipei. Formed in 1919, the KMT was the sole ruling party of China from 1928 to 2000 and is currently an opposition political party in the Legislative Yuan.

The predecessor of the Kuomintang, the Revolutionary Alliance (Tongmenghui), was one of the major advocates of the overthrow of the Qing dynasty, the subsequent revolt in 1911, and the proclamation of the Republic of China. The KMT was founded by Song Jiaoren and Sun Yat-sen shortly after the Xinhai Revolution of 1911. Sun was the provisional President, but he ceded the presidency to Yuan Shikai. Yuan's death in 1916 led to the nation's disintegration in the Warlord Era. Sun deputed Chiang Kai-shek to form the National Revolutionary Army and launch the Northern Expedition that unified much of mainland China and established the capital at Nanjing. During the following Nanjing decade China achieved substantial economic growth and social progress, but the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945) was disastrous. After the loss of the Chinese Civil War (1945-1949) to the Communist Party of China the KMT retreated to Taiwan where it continued to govern as an authoritarian one-party state. The Nationalist government retained China's United Nations seat until 1971.

STORY

In the fall of 1925, with this centralization of power, Kwangtung could be brought more under Party influence as the Revolutionary Base. During the last week in September, the Military Council ordered Chiang Kai-shek to rid Kwangtung, once and for all, of Ch’en Chiung-ming’s rival military power. As general commander of a Second Eastern Expedition, Chiang set forth with his troops on October 6,1925. He took Ch’en’s stronghold, the walled city of Huichou, by mid-October, and in early December he finally scattered the enemy into the ranges bordering Fukien and Kiangsi. Within the month, NRA elements had swept through Kwangtung to the east and south from Canton, securing the Revolutionary Base.
