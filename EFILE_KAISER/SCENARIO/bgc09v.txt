Despite the lack of substantial artillery support we have repulsed the Turkish counter-attack that could have easily pushed us back all the way down to ANZAC cove. Even though the breakout has not been a total success we have at least achieved some territorial gains and could establish new positions at Sari Bair ridge.

HISTORICAL OUTCOME:
On the morning of August 10th Kemal led an overwhelming Turkish counter-attack. His plan lacked subtlety, but was brutally effective - overrun the defenders by sheer weight of numbers. Kemal led his men from the front. During the fight he was struck in the chest by shrapnel, but was saved by his pocket watch which absorbed the blow.
There were about 2,000 defenders on or below the summit of Chunuk Bair, and another 3,000 troops at the Farm. The Turks swept over the Lancashire battalion on the summit, wiping it out to the last man. The Wiltshires were killed or driven into the steep valleys. The Turks headed down Rhododendron Spur towards the Pinnacle, driving the New Army troops before them. New Zealand machine gunners positioned at the Apex shot down the Turks as they tried to continue down the spur. The gunners could not discriminate friend from foe so they also killed many New Army troops who were amongst the charging Turks. The Turks descended to the small plateau of the Farm and annihilated Baldwin's brigade. About 1,000 British were killed, the rest driven off into the surrounding gullies.
