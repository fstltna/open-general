The conquest of Serbia - November 11th, 1915

Liebe Anna,

We've finally reached our destination in central Serbia. It's almost a relief, after travelling through most of Europe for nearly a month. When we left Italy they sent us to France, but just a few days later the High Command decided that we would be more useful in the Balkans, acting as a reinforcement unit.

Don't worry about me. We arrived here one month after the offensive began, and in that time our army, along with our Austrian and Bulgarian allies, have already defeated the Serbians. All we have to do now is to march as quickly as we can and destroy the remnants of the Serbian Army before they can flee to any of the neighbouring countries. Believe me, it won't be too hard.

Für immer dein,
Hugo

ORDERS: Major Hugo Bauernschmitt, you, along with some units of the XXII Reserve Korps and the Austrian 10th Mountain Brigade, will have to go to the south as quickly as you can and take control of the roads that lead to Albania and Montenegro. Should the Serbians resist you, do not hesitate to use force. It will be a good opportunity to test the usefulness of your new artillery battery.

OBJECTIVES: Take all the VHs.
