Herr General
Soviet 2nd. guards army and 51. military attacks on Rostov on Don. If they occupy Rostov they will cut off our whole army group "A" , which draws off from Caucasus and that meets same fate, like 6th army in Stalingrad.
Withdraw all your forces to Rostov to hold Rostov and bridges across the river Don. When you can you must push through to Novocherkassk for victory.
