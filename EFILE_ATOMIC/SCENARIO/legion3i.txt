SITUATION: 

Albania refused our offers to join the Italian Empire. So it is only logical to built upon our strong influence on Albania and occupy the country as a whole. Your troops have been selected to carry out this mission. We don't expect much resistance, but be aware that the Albanian Army was trained by italian officers for more than a decade.

ORDERS:

Land your troops, capture Durres and move further into the hinterland and take Tirana. Capture all VHs in 16/18/22 turns for a BV/V/TV.

NOTE:

You can buy one unit in this scenario.
