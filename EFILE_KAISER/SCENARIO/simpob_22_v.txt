And that was how the Red Army was crushed by Diterikhs and his Tobol offensive. Thousands of Bolshevik soldiers died or were captured, along with tons of equipment. In the following weeks we retook Siberia almost without a fight: Tobolsk, Tiumen, Chelyabinsk, Ekaterinburg and many other cities and towns fell very easily. The communist panicked every time that they heard that we were approaching, and ran to the west as fast as they could.

Nothing stopped us until we reached the Urals. Winter was coming, and we knew that Lenin would send fresh Soviet divisions to the east very soon, so Kolchak ordered us to stop and dig in.

The next spring both sides planned different strategies, but there were very few real changes on the front line. We weren't strong enough to reach the Volga, and much less Moscow. On the other hand, the Bolsheviks could never overcome our defenses on the Urals. Besides, the United Kingdom, France, the United States and Japan were pressing Kolchak in order to end the war. They even threatened to retire their support if we didn't make a deal with the communists.

So, in the end, we had to accept the conditions that the British presented at the Armistice of Helsinki. The partition of Russia came into effect: the Bolsheviks would rule in the west, and Kolchak in the new State of Trans-Ural Russia. Of course, Denikin and Wrangel obtained the recognition of their tiny Free Crimean State, too.

After the civil war finished, I left the Army and I established myself in Ekaterinburg. I started to work as a teacher, I married and I raised a family. We've been working hard, trying to improve our country and make it thrive. I'm optimistic, and I'm sure that Trans-Ural has a bright future. May God help us to make that dream come true.

The campaign is over. I hope you've liked it and thanks for playing.
