Good morning comrade Lieutenant-General. STAVKA has decided it is time for you to break the stalemate at Khalkin Gol. The Japanese have been pouring reinforcements into the area, but, as you know, so have we, and we continue to do so. Therefore you will expel the invaders and push them back to where they came from!
