STORY: After its successful counter-attack and the Battle of Morava-Ivan, the Hellenic Army penetrated deep into Italian-held Albanian territory, taking control of the local urban centers of Gjirokastër and Korytsa (December 1940). In a war council, at 5 December, General Alexander Papagos, worried about the possibility of German intervention in support of the Italians, attempted to hasten the advance. Moreover, Generals Pitsikas and Tsolakoglou suggested the immediate capture of the Klisura pass so as to secure the Greek positions.

During the period of the Greek counter-offensive, the Greek forces had much greater distances to contend with and their logistics and road network were substantially inferior compared to the Italians. The Klisura pass was a particularly strategic location toward the town of Berat and the topography of the terrain in addition to bad weather made the operation extremely difficult.

The attack was led by the II Army Corps, and especially by the 1st and 11th Divisions. During the battle, the Italians used for the first time the new M13 medium tanks of the Centauro Armored Division. They were used on frontal attacks, but the result was disastrous, as they were decimated by the Greek artillery fire. On 10 January, after four days of fierce battles, the Greek infantry divisions finally captured the pass. The final assault that led to the location's capture was led by the recently arrived 5th Division, which consisted mainly of Cretans.

The Italian headquarters immediately launched counterattacks to recapture the sector. Italian Supreme Commander Ugo Cavallero ordered the newly arrived Lupi di Toscana Division to support the Julia Alpine Division, but the operation was ill-prepared. Although they faced only four Greek battalions, they rapidly lost one battalion of their own due to encirclement. By 11 January, the Italian attack had been pushed back and over the next days, the Lupi di Toscana were almost annihilated. This failure secured Greek possession of the pass.
