Situation report: The Japanese are falling back in disarray. We must keep up our pressure on them until they are driven from New Guinea completely. Our next target will be the port of Finschhafen.

Operational orders: You will use a ground assault combined with an Amphibious landing to capture the port of Finschhafen. The enemy has few naval forces in the area, but we have attached some naval units to your force which should offer you adequate protection.
