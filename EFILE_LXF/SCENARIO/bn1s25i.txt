General, it's time to give the allied troops in Africa a mortal blow! The occupation of the Suez Canal is of vital strategic importance. You and your men will take the northern part of the Suez Canal with Port Said in an airborne attack. The southern part and Port Suez will take by armoured DAK troops. Good luck!

AUXIN - Air-landing and Naval units, Air-Support
HINT - Be careful! The British Mediterranean fleet is present. Expect counter-attacks from west and south.
