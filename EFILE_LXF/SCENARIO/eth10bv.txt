BRILLANT VICTORY

In the next four days there was little hand-to-hand fighting in this battle of maneuver.

The very concept of a fortified position isolated in the desert and easily outflanked was a bluff, as the Turks must have known and the Ethiopians soon found out.  


            ***VERY IMPORTANT RULES***

FOR ONLY THE NEXT SCENARIO (scn.11):

1- You must downgrade or upgrade all your infantry units into Guerrilla units. 

2- You're not allowed to use your artillery and tank units.
