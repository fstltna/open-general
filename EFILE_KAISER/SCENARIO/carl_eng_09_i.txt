Retreat from Estella

(Semifictional scenario)

February 25th, 1876

This is over. You have to tell the King. I do not dare, but you need to tell him because we must save as much as we can, both for the interests of the country, and for our personal gain assurance, recognition of ranks, etc.. The King must go to France and leave a general in Spain with the task of dealing with the enemy.
(Letter from General Pérula)

Victory conditions:
Remove ten units from the map at the village of Úgar, in the hexagon (18.2)
Keep your VH in Estella.
If you lose your cavalry unit (Carlos VII), you will lose.

Note: Liberal troops are mainly located along the main roads. Maybe you could cross the mountain areas undetected.
