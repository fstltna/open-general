06. Hube's Pocket - The German Collapse VICTORY

Congratulations Herr Major. First Panzer Armee has not been encircled. 

You and your men are sent West for rest and refitting. 

HISTORY
When the Soviets had nearly encircled First Panzer Armee, Hitler refused von Manstein's request for a retreat to avoid encirclement. After First Panzer Armee was encircled, Hitler finally gave in and ordered Hube - the commander of First Panzer Armee - to attempt a breakout. With the help of an attack from outside the pocket by Paul Hausser's II SS Panzer Corps, First Panzer Armee was able to break out - although it only had 45 armoured vehicles left. Shortly after the events, Manstein was relieved of command.
