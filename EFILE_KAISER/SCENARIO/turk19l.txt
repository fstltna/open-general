Battle of Dumlupinar  - loss

I can't believe that you allowed yourself to be defeated by the Greeks. Now everything is lost!

Historical outcome 
Dumlupinar was a disater for the Greeks. Tens of thousands were killed, wounded, captured, or simply deserted. In just two weeks, the Turkish army managed to re-capture all the territories which the Hellenes had taken since 1919. Izmir was the last city reconquered by the Turks, on 9 September 1922. It was the last military action of the Turkish Independence War.

One month later, on 11 October, the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, Italy, France and Britain, signed the Armistice of Mudanya. Greece was forced to sign it three days later. 

The negotiations with the Turkish rebels went on. On 1 November 1922 the Turkish provisional government abolished the Ottoman Sultanate. On 24 July 1923 the Entente countries and the Turks signed the Treaty of Lausanne, ending the Turkish War of Independence and defining the borders of the new republic. Once the Entente had recognized its sovereignty within its new borders, the Grand National Assembly of Turkey declared itself the Republic of Turkey on 29 October 1923. And this is how modern Turkey was born.

The campaign is over, we hope you've liked it, and thanks for playing.
