This has been a disastrous, unexpected defeat. Our men are running for their lives, trying desperately to cross to the safe shore of the Drina, and many are dying there, drowned. The Serbians have rejected our first offensive in this war.

I should send you to take care of the Royal Stables, but I can't afford losing any officers. So get out of my sight for a few weeks, and I'll call you again when there is another chance to redeem yourself against the Serbians.
