INSURGENCY

Ryburn's Diary - July 30th, 2052

"The first thing I did after getting that promotion was get smashed at O'Connor's.   The second thing I did was hitch a ride all the way out here, to the middle of goddamn nowhere."

"Those hotheads, the 'Ashes' or whatever they're calling themselves now, have basically graduated to a standing army.  The brass calling the shots have sent me and my command to take care of the insurgency here in the highlands."

"Let's see how their little rebellion stands up to mobile armor and multiple rocket launchers."

NOTES
------------
*Take all rebel victory hexes to win.
*All newly purchased units will come with 300 experience.
*This campaign uses green replacements; you can use them for cheaper healing at the cost of a unit's experience.
*Attachments can be added to your units for boosts, but they also come with penalties; make informed decisions when purchasing.
