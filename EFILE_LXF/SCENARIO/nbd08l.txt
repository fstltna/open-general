This loss really hurts. But it did not slow down our British Allies. They have defeated the enemy at Mareth and the Afrika Korps has surrendered to Montgomery.  Now it appears that the US Army had very little to do with this victory. Monty is getting all the press and Ike is a very unhappy man. He had ordered a firing squad for you, but Washington feels that might be too good for you. One thing is for certain, from now on our men will be safe from your leadership, until this war is over anyway.
