The River Matz Riposte

The First World War - Spring Offensive - The River Matz Riposte - June 10th, 1918

"Fabienne, ma chère épouse,

I am not sure if you believe my predictions anymore. The big German offensive in March that I declared as their last effort, was followed by another one, and another one.... and anolther one. I have no clue where they found the means and men to mount their attacks. Probably they come marching right out of hell. It is true, none of their offensives since the "Kaiserschlacht" in March has been a great success, but they are able to postpone the inevitable end of the war week by week, and month by month. And so many brave men still perish in the merciless storms of steel. Mon Dieu, when will this war ever end?

Right now, we have gathered information from German POWs that the enemy will mount another attack in the Noyon-Montidier area, and has even sent some units of their monstrous A7V tanks to the front.. But knowing of their plans in advance has given us some valuable time to prepare for this assault. At this moment, General Mangin is building up a strong battle group for a counter-attack, including massive numbers of St. Chamond and Schneider tanks. I have received orders to support the local troops defending the area and wait for Mangin's force to join in a forceful counterattack.

Let's pray that this will really, really be the last attack of our foe.

Je t'aime,
Jean-Babtiste."
