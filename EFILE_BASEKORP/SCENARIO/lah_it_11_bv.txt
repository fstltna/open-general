We have retaken Kharkov!  In a masterstroke we have corrected the tactical situation brought about by the Stalingrad disaster.  I doubt it could have been achieved without the tireless efforts of the Leibstandarte.  The red square in Kharkov has been renamed 'Leibstandarteplatz' in the divisions honour.
