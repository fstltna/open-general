You are sailing to Port Said.
Despite the season the sun shines warm, the sea is as calm as a lake, and there is no wind.
It's really a pleasure cruise on the blue waters of the Mediterranean.

Until you hear the alarm sirens.
Seem you found the other part of the British Mediterranean fleet, or maybe they found you.
Anyway, you have to save your ships and men: There are at least two British battleships among them, probably also a carrier or two.
Fight, flee, or do any combination of those two, but try to arrive in fighting condition at Port Said, you wont be able to repair before arriving.


Instructions: Get at least 14 ground units to the exit hex on the eastern side. Planes don't count, so be sure to deploy at least 14 ships and sea transports.
Keep in mind that your units won't be auto-repaired before the next scenario. Don't do anything reckless.
