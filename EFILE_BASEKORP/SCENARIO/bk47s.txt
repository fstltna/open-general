Sit down Herr General. The invasion of the Amerika's has started! The Italians have established a base in Canada but need our support. Your troops are to attack the northern coast and link up with the Italians and then drive inland.
Do not attempt an attack on the southern coast! Our reports indicate that it is heavily defended. We suggest your airborne troops take an airbase for your planes to operate from.
Just a moment Herr General, the latest reports show the Canadians have installed hidden radar bases. This could cause major problems for your troops. Your paratroopers may be required to remove these.
