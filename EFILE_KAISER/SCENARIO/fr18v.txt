Général, bon !
We have returned to the Aisne. Our counterattack has broken Germany's neck.


HISTORICAL EVENTS:
The Second Battle of the Marne was an important victory. The Allies took 29,367 prisoners, 793 guns and 3,000 machine guns and inflicted 168,000 casualties on the Germans. For this success,  Ferdinand Foch received the baton of a Marshal of France.

The main consequence of the battle was the improvement of the morale. The strategic gains on the Marne marked the end of a string of German victories and the beginning of a series of Allied victories that, in three months, would  bring the German Army to its knees.
