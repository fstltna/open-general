SS Panzer Gruppe 'Rodtwher was ready to move.A Frau took a look up for a moment."Look Helga".In the Sky above a Parachute ascending slowly and landing among the girls. A SS/BdM crewmember took off Her flight helmet,brushed Her red hair and pulled out a cigarette "Hey somebody give Me a Light"."Sure,where did You come from Darling"?" Eh up there Silly,where do You think.You didn't take Me for an Angel did You"? "Nah that would be impossible,aint no Angels this Far East.Just Us trying to kill the Soviets and them trying to kill Us.A lot of Us destined to see Angels soon"."Aint that the Truth.Nah I'm originally from Strasburg.Our Bomber was 12,000 feet above to the East of here but developed some trouble.The other girls I had bail out about 6 kilometers from here and I stayed with the Bomber but then realized I couldn't save it so I pointed it East,auto-pilot on and got out.Should give the Soviets some more scrap of Ours to salvage"."How's the Bombing going up there anyway"?I think Our Heavies are doing alright on the cities,the troops in the Field I doubt if were even being a nusiance to with the numbers the Soviets got and of course trips to Moscow below 10,000 feet are suicide.Old Stalins protecting that as if it was all that matters.I really want to fly a 'Stuka but Commands assigned Me to the heavies, JU 88's at the moment and of course all of Us are assigned the Kondors as they arrive"."So We going to win this War"? "Ask the Fuhress".
