Your victory at Irkutsk shattered Chinese resistance west of Lake Baikal. The remnants of that army has retreated behind the Mongolian border. This gives our forces the extra time they need to consolidate and bring up reinforcements. There may be no end to the supply of troops for the People's Republic of China, but the ghosts of our defeat here four years ago can now rest as you have avenged them.
