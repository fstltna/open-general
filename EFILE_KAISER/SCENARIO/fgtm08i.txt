First Battle of Lodz
19th November, 1914
Gospodin General-Major, following the defeat of the 2nd Army in Eastern Prussia, Stavka has reorganized our forces on the North-Western front.  A new 2nd Army has been formed from Siberian rifle divisions with the aim of invading German Silesia, using the giant Polish Salient as the springboard for the offensive.  However, the Germans have transferred divisions from the Western Front and have formed a new 9th Army, which in concert with the 8th, is attempting to outflank our 2nd Army through Northern Poland.

The initial German attack toward the city of Lodz was highly successful:  the XXV Res and I Cavalry corps located a large gap between our 2nd and 1st armies and poured in to exploit the envelopment.  The 2nd Army has pulled back from its offensive stance in response.  We hope to use the XIX Corps - a triumphant veteran from Galician battles - to push the German right wing back, while we muster the 2nd Army's forces to repel the German envelopment attempt.  The 1st Army has dispatched an ad-hoc force (the Lovitch Group) to our aid from the North-East.
