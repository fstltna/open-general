Comrade General, that was spectacular, to say the least.  Your display of Soviet military might has forced the cowardly pigs leading the Chinese government to plead for a cessation of hostilities.  For this, Comrade Stalin has agreed to sign off on a paper giving you a dacha in Leningrad.  You should be proud, Comrade.
