Kindralmajor,

Although you have failed to capture Riga, the German forces have been severely weakened by your actions at Cesis.  A diplomatic solution was reached with British and French aid.

The Ministry has deemed fit to offer you a promotion to Kindralleitnant and to place under your command the army slated to attack Petrograd.

Kindralleitnant, your nation calls upon her warriors to carry this war to our enemies and to guarantee peace and stability of our borders!
