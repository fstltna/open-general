Perfect. You'll be in Tobruk in no time. And you'd better be, for right now we need to send you 5 tons of fuel, ammunition, water or food for you to receive 1 ton! The rest ends up lost or destroyed by the British aviation. We definitely can't afford this on the long run, especially with Barbarossa going on back home.

Rest and repair, you'll need to keep pushing ahead relentlessly.
