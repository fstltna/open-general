The Italian column finally arrived in Saati. All that campaign was an useless effort for us. Besides, outraged by our attacks, Italy and Britain threatened Emperor Yohannes with heavy military reprisals. That was something that Ethiopia simply couldn't afford, so in the end we had to retire from all the coastal areas, and even from part of the Highlands, too.

Not satisfied with that, Italy strengthened its alliance with King Menelik, sending even more arms, ammunition and other supplies to Shewa. The Italians thought that, as soon as he believed he was powerful enough, Menelik would try to claim Yohannes's throne. But that wasn't going to happen. Providence had arranged a different ending for Yohannes the Great.
