For The Indivisible Österreich 1848-49

General, as you know, the French rebellion has infected the German states and uprisings have occurred throughout our Empire also. Czechs, Hungarians, Italians are revolting and even our beloved Vienna is defaced by the riots of the scum. Emperor Ferdinand is not hmm... a strong character, and Chancellor Metternich had to resign. The situation is serious. The established order has collapsed. The Court has to simulate negotiations with the rebels, but you must start to regather and rearm your army and restore law and order.
