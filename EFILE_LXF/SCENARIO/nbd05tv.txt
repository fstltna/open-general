Well, we are a bit disappointed with this outcome. If you have this much trouble driving the Japanese off a lightly defended Island, how can we expect you to cope with their island bastions in the Pacific? Well, it seems that there is exactly that sort of operation in the works right now. And you will get a chance to prove that you can measure up as a commander. I remind you, a loss here and it's back to a training command in the states for you . . .
