July, 4., 1864  Harper's Ferry


Dear Friend,
Once again we are in the Harper's Ferry vicinity. 
When the confederate army under Jubel A. Early was approaching us, General Sigel gave orders to evacuate the city. We took positions north of the Potomac river on the Maryland Heights. 
We hear rumors that the High Command of the Army once again fell in disfavor with Sigel and that he will be replaced soon. 
We also received orders to attack in the next hours and retake the strategic important Harper's Ferry bridges, as well as the city.

ORDERS:
Retake the city!

ADVICE FROM YOUR OLDEST SERGEANT:
Sir, we should cross the rivers up- or downstream. The riverside at Harper's Ferry seems to be well defended....
