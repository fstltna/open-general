From the Volga to Vladivostok, many anti-Bolshevik forces roam the turbulent Eastern regions of Russia in 1918. Separated by strong ideological and ethnic differences, and without a centralized command, they are too weak to threaten the Red power. But, united, they could become a formidable force. Maybe strong enough to change the course of the civil war.

This time you'll follow a young Russian officer that joins the anti-Bolshevik army in the spring of 1918. Sometimes attacking, sometimes retreating, but always fighting, your actions will determine if the Whites have a chance to win the war...or if you must settle for saving your life and spend the rest of your days in exile.
