Operation Blücher

Operation 'Bluecher' - one of many which had been planned but were never executed.

In August, 1942, after the conquest of Sevastopol, Manstein's 11th Army and Romanian units were scheduled to cross the straits of Kerch and land on the Kuban peninsula to support the Caucasus offensive.

However, the 11th Army was transferred to the Leningrad front to take part in operation 'Nordlicht' instead. Anyway, it is doubtful if 'Bluecher' had been successful. The Soviet Black Sea Fleet was still very strong, while the Axis only had some torpedo boats and small u-boats in that area. The Luftwaffe therefore would have had to concentrate on fighting the Soviet ships instead on supporting the landing forces. Furthermore, there had been hardly enough transport ships and port facilities for such a large scale operation.

But maybe you are successful with 'Bluecher'? Or you can even start a counter-attack and re-gain Kerch as the Soviet commander?
--------------------------------
Scenario specific:
German unit designations are mostly correct (thx to Amona), the Romanian ones on division level. The Soviet designations are fictitious.
Furthermore, Soviet reinforcements by TK and ATY units from the Caucasus front are simulated.
