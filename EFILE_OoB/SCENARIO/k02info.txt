02. NARVIK 1 (9 April 1940)

TO: Fregattenkapitaen of Gruppe 1
SUBJECT: Operation Weserubung

---Our Fuhrer has finally agreed on our wish dating from the Great War. To prevent a British naval blockade we will seize the Norwegian coasts before the Allies can. The invasion of Denmark and Norway will consist of several Gruppen heading for a specific port. Your Gruppe 1 will head for the northern Norwegian port of Narvik. 

The Norwegian Navy will not be much of a problem. However an British flotilla has been sighted and will likely engage your units. However speed is important. Our Kriegsmarine is not capable of a full encounter with the British Royal Navy. It is essential to quickly seize the vital points in the Narvik area so that your ships can get back to open sea.---
