The Battle of St.Margriete Houtem

August 18, 1914

With the Belgian 1st Cavalry Division on the Northern flank shaken, it is time to hit the 1st Infantry Division (*) just South of it. A quick and successful attack here will push back the Belgian army before the French can fill the gap between the 4th Infantry Division at Namur - to your South East - and the rest of the Belgian Army that is in front of your forces. Taking the Belgian Army out of the picture will allow us to turn the First Armee South towards Paris.

(*) You inflicted heavy casualties on the 4 Brigade Mixte at Halen when it came to the help of the Cavalry Division, so we expect this Brigade being kept in reserve.
