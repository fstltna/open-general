It must be said that the Oder-Warthe-Bogen had been overcome in less than four days. The Soviets lost approximately 2500 killed in action.
There were a lot reasons for the quick German loss. The anti-tank defense was insufficient, the artillery support was inadequate, and there was no trained garrison for the fieldworks and most of the heavy weapons had been passed to the Atlantic Wall and the West Wall earlier in the war. So what should have been a very tough defensive line was only a paper tiger.

Next scenario: New units have strength 8 and experience 50.
