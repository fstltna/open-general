Gazala Line
(Operation Theseus)

May 26th - 1942

The whole Cyrenaica area is now under our control, however we know that the enemy have established a defensive line between the villages of Gazalla and Bir Hacheim. Aufklarung reports shows that the British are using anti-personnel, as well as anti-tank mine fields in that line to stop our advance on towards Egypt.

Your task is to accomplish the codenamed ,,Operation Theseus''. This operation means to break the enemy lines in the Bir Hacheim area using the best of the DAK armored forces, and make a fast advance behind the front lines, surrounding the enemy. Finally, you should assault the Tobruk fortress, and take all the other mission objetives.

Viel Gluck!.
