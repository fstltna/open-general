Zloczow
July 1, 1917

Welcome back to the South-Western Front, Gospodin General!  It appears that now the Army needs not only withstand the frontal assault of the enemy, but also the creeping malaise of pacifism and defeatism seeping from behind...

With the February revolution and the Tsar's abdication, a provisional government, headed by Kerensky, has assumed power of the Russian Empire.  Kerensky has promised our Entente allies to carry out a summer offensive to coincide with their efforts on the Western Front.  The French Neville offensive failed, and the British efforts at Arras have not paid off.  Kerensky has appointed Alexei Brusilov to command the Front and to muster the strength to break through.

At Zborow, the site of all too familiar to our cavalry since 1914 and to the Czech Legion since 1916, the VI Corps of the 11th Army has been tasked with breaking through toward Zloczow.  You will receive the French Air detachment and the Belgian Armored Car Corps as reinforcements.  You will face experienced German divisions, as they have taken over supreme command of the Galician Front.  Our air recoinnasance has reported few strategic reinforcements available to the enemy, so a breakthrough here will open the road to Lemberg.  May God grant you speed in this battle!
