LOSS
---------------------------------
The Turkish garrison in Gaza was on the verge of collapse when night fell. However, in a decision that dismayed most of their soldiers, the Higher Command decided to call off the attack and retreat, delivering victory to the Turks. The decision to withdraw was motivated by the failing light, mounting casualties amongst the infantry and reports that Turkish reinforcements, estimated in excess of 10,000 strong, were approaching from the north and east. 

However, the reinforcements that had engaged our defensive screen of light horsemen had already been repulsed with relative ease when the order to retreat was given. How could we give away victory so easily?

But what's even worse is that the Turks will take a lot of motivation out of their victory and their determination to defend the Gaza-Beersheba line will be much greater now than it has been before.
