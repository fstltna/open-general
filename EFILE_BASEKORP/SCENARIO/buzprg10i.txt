Through the Lesser Fatra

Part 5/7 of the "Commanding the Corps" minicampaign.

*****

While the Czechoslovak tanks were recalled for the Ostrava operation, most of the corps moved through Slovakia.

On 11th April 1945 the 1st Czechoslovak Army Corps captured Turciansky Svaty Martin. The next main city was Zilina, but as the road through the narrow Strecianske Valley was blocked by the Germans and moreover the bridges were flooded away, it was decided to move through the Mala Fatra mountains.

Intelligence and reconnaisance: Although their forces are mainly infantry battalions, Germans are heavily entrenched and the mountaineous terrain gives them a solid advantage. They have quite strong artillery support and they've build many bunkers, both concrete and improvised.

Reinforces: Locals had organized an auxiliary unit and one Romanian infantry regiment is on its way to the area.

Hint: Czechoslovaks captured Hitler's own "befehl" that orders an extreme discipline to the German units. Be ready for a really rugged defense...
Once you'll capture Zilina, you may use it as a base of operation - the SH works for both sides.

Victory conditions: Capture all VHs.
