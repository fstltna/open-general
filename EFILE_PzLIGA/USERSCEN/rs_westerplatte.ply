Westerplatte

The very beginning of WW2, made up in a rather fictitous way.

At 4:45 a.m. the old ship-of-the-line 'Schleswig-Holstein' opens fire at the 'Westerplatte' outpost near Danzig.   
The 200 Polish defenders, under the command of major Henryk Sucharski, have the order to resist for 12 hours.
Cut off the outside world, without ammo and food supplies, they repulse German attacks for 7 days! Eventually the rest of them surrenders.

In this scenario, however, many things are quite different ...
