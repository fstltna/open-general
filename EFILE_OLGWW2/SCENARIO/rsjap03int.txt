Ketsu-Go - The battle for Tokyo

November, 1945

General, you have been promoted to C-I-C of the defense of Tokyo, it's an enormous honor to protect the Imperial capital... isn't it?. Let me inform you about the reports we have about the enemy movements. We know they are going to disembark in two main fronts, one southwards from Tokyo, and another one in the East. According to our sources, the Americans have assembled a huge mass of Assault ships, supported by carriers and many warships.

Your task is ''easy'', stop the americans, and kick them out from the Tokyo sector. Our special air attack units (tokko), and our land attack units recruited from the population will attack in first wave... they are deployed in the beaches, and we are sure they will act like true samurais, then, use your units to counterattack... This is the last battle of the war, we must get the victory to save the Japanese Empire, or die.

BANZAI!!!
