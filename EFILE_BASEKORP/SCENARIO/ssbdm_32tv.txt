SS Frau Commander Stowe's Panzer III had been hit knocking a tread off.Still the Panzer fired on the 2 Soviet tanks destroying them."Good shooting Rall,let's get the Hell out of this coffin before some more Ivan's come over that hill".The crew made a run for it Soviet infantry firing at them.In some weeds,then a ravine and out of the shooting gallery.Now back with the rear units a few Mark IV's went by."Commander do You think we'll ever get one of those to fight in"? "I don't know Erika.Heard most were assigned to the Central Front because of Stalin protecting Moscow first"."Boy if it's worst there then in this area how are any of the Frau's even alive"."They got the majority of the 'Stuka's on call.Without them the Center would have done been rolled up".Back in Lennigrad Commander Stowe reported to Frau Major 'Trenrick at the Armor depot.All tanks had been assigned except for a few Mark I's which of course were Deathtraps against Ivan and mostly used for Recon though they were being pushed back into the fighting to fill the gaps."Stowe,Gwendoth Rall's in Your crew,Right.Be a shame to put Her talent in a PZ 1.Get over to the rail depot.Some Stu III's have arrived,let Rall get Her hands on a 75mm instead of these Pea Shooters she has been accustomed too".So Commander Stowe would trade the turning turret and smaller gun for a 75mm.
