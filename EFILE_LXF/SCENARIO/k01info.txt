01. WESTERPLATTE (1 September 1939)

TO: Korvettenkapitaen
SUBJECT: Attack on Poland

---Our country is on the brink of war. There is no way back know and the Kriegsmarine has been given order to destroy the Polish fleet and support the conquest of the Polish Corridor and the Free City of Danzig.

Your flotilla, with our KM "Schleswig-Holstein" lying in the port of Danzig itself, will open fire at 4.47 AM and start the attack to take Danzig and the Polish fortress on the peninsula of Westerplatte. The Poles have dug in well and it will be vital that your ships will support your Marines in their assault. You can expect assistance from local units of Danzig which inhabitants fully support our side.---
