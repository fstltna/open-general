The First World War - Assault at Artois - 17th, Dec. 1914 L

Général, you have failed! We've not been able to recover even just one meter of terrain. It's a shame for the whole French army.

However, because of your experience in colonial warfare, the QG has new plans for you and your men.

HISTORICAL EVENTS:
Both sides suffered heavy losses, and the Germans held the Loretto Heights until the third Battle of Artois in November 1915. Even then, they could stop the French a few kilometres to the East, at the Vimy Ridges, south of Lens.
All in All, the First Battle of Artois was a very bloody engagement, and one first taste of Verdun.
