<Isn't this fun?>

<The generators that power the Temporal Transporter are depleted.  If this was a human machine I'd be worried, but since my designers were significantly more competent than any human, we're not trapped here in this barren wasteland.>

<Most fortuitously, there are several large sources of power in the ruins of your former bastions of grandeur.  If you seize these cities from the miserable cultists occupying them, I can divert the power back to the Transporter and we can escape this timeline.>

<This is a simple mission.  But beware of the cultists.  They have proven themselves to be a most mobile and resourceful opponent, and they may try something sneaky.>

<You must move quickly or I will lose the element of surprise.>

<That is the mission.  Now go.>
