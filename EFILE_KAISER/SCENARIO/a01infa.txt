01. Kiev (28 February 1918)

The Bolshevik rule in Russia had resulted in a armistice with the Central Powers signed on 17 December 1917. At the moment peace talks are taking place in Brest-Litovsk. To force the Bolsheviks to sign, the Central Powers have resumed their offensive actions and because of the complete dissarray of the Russian Army, they are pushing deep into the Ukraine. At the time, the Czech Legion was retreating east to avoid capture by the German Army. The Czech Legion was now an independant force, obeying only to their own commander as nobody else could be trusted. 

Near the end of February 1918 the German Army had reached the outskirts of the Ukrainian capitol of Kiev. The Bolshevik authorities have fled the city leaving only behind the most fanatical volunteers. Ukrainian nationalist are welcoming the Germans as liberators of their country. One of the German goals is to capture or destroy the Czech Legion for it was that force that was essential in slowing down the German advance time after time. 

As we speak the Czech Legion has partly reached Kiev and parts of the Legion  will take up defensive positions at the bridges over the Dnjepr River, so that the bulk of Czech Legion can retreat even deeper into the Ukraine and stay out of German hands. You will have to hold out for at least five days.

NOTE: After 11 turns you must hold 3 VHs to win the scenario.
