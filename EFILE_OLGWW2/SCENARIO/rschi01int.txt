Retaliation at Shanghai

August, 1937

Welcome honourable new commander. Your first task as an army officer will be the attack on Shanghai, one of the most important Chinese cities. This attack on Shanghai was not included in our original plans for China, however our nearby garrisoned troops have been bombed by Chinese troops from Shanghai, and, of course we can't allow that. The Chinese must pay!. The high command thinks you will be a great warrior in the future, and with this first lesson we want to test your skills on the art of the combined operations...

Our spies have reported that the puny Chiang-Kai-Shek has deployed here in Shanghai the best of his Kuomingtang troops, his German equiped divisions, but... they won't be a threat for our brave soldiers. Take Shanghai and establish a coastal position to allow further penetrations into the China mainland. Gather your division and land your command quickly!  The warship Idzumo and some air units will support your actions.
