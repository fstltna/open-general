[The Supreme druid approaches towards you:] 

My prince, I bow to you .....!

We successfully defended our homeland, and bloody avenged ourselves on the Romans ...!

.... From you and this campaign, generations will still sing even in hundreds of years ....!

.... Let me accompany you to the Capitol for the victory celebration: there is fresh beer and roast goose....
