Peace through strength: Zhitomir

May 19th, 1920

During 1919 Poland was a formidable foe for the Red Army, that tried in vain to expand to the west only to be defeated by the brave Poles. I am convinced that, were it not for Poland, the Bolsheviks would have reached the borders of Germany, Hungary and other countries, where they would have instigated successful communist revolutions. Most people in Europe don't realise how much they owe to Poland, that acted as a barrier to the Soviet expansion. Personally, I respect and appreciate what the Poles did.

However, the respect that we had for the Polish army, and the fact that the Bolsheviks were our common enemies for many months, couldn't hide the mutual enmity that existed between us. We knew that, once the Red Army was finally destroyed, Poland would become our new main enemy, at least in the short term.

But I must be clear about this: in 1920 we didn't want a war with Poland. Kolchak was resigned to accept the demands of the League of Nations and to leave the Poles alone. It was them who, blinded by their victories against the Bolsheviks, believed that they could force us to leave Belarus and Ukraine, where they would support the establishment of independent republics that (of course!) would be allies of Poland and enemies of Russia.

And that was how, in April 1920, Poland invaded Ukraine. Naturally, that act of aggression against us was condemned by the League of Nations, whose delegates made us know that if Russia used an armed force against the Polish Army, only for defensive purposes, the League would support us. That was all that Kolchak wanted, and he immediately sent an army to Volinia, in western Ukraine, in order to stop the Polish invasion.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.
