12. RASOWO (12 December 1944)

To the commanding officer of 22. ID (LL):

The retreat is going fine despite horrendous weather and ground conditions, terrible to non-existing roads, partisan attacks, and few supplies. The divisions of the Heeresgruppe have held the front and are retreating in good order without chaos.

Your division is stretched in a column between Prijepolje north-west and Bijelo Polje to the south-east. Still fighting in Montenegro XXI Gebirgs Armeekorps finds its way to your division cut by the enemy.

You have orders to hold your positions while sending a kampfgruppe into the mountains to clear the only acceptable road to XXI Korps going  through the village of Rasowo. XXI Korps will fight a way to your men. We will not leave units behind!


RULES: 
- Do not upgrade, sell or buy units - nor upgrading transports.
- Replacing lost units by buying new units is allowed. Replacements should be the exact same unit as the lost unit. Infantry units must be replaced by "Volksgrenadiere" units.
