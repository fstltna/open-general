Marshall!

All of Italy is celebrating!

Your forces took the Allies by surprise from which they did not recover!  Peace talks have already brought a cease fire and we expect to sign peace within hours.

You and your forces will be on trains to the Alps even before the peace treaty is signed to keep Germany from invading.

God bless you, you have saved Italy from the destruction that Germany is soon to suffer.
