Komarów, the last cavalry battle

August 31st, 1920

Our pursuit of the retreating Bolshevik army has been quite successful so far. Now we have an opportunity to encircle and destroy the Russian's 1st cavalry Army, one of the best units in the Red Army.

The Cavalry Army, led by Semyon Budionny, is now near the town of Zamosc. But since it's heavily defended by our infantry units, he has decided to move to Komarów, some 12 miles to the east. If we attack there with our cavalry units, we could trap the Soviets between Zamosc and Niewirków. We count on you for this mission, General.

Victory conditions: Take all VHs.

Intelligence report: On turn 7 you will receive reinforcements coming from the west. But beware of Russian reinforcements.

Good luck!

Recommended core: For the sake of historical accuracy, you should only deploy cavalry and mounted artillery units in this scenario.
