Battle of Dobro Pole

September 15th, 1918

It's sad to admit it, but we chose the losing side on this war. The Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian empires are disintegrating, and Germany will be forced to surrender in a matter of weeks. The morale of our soldiers and our citizens is at its lowest, and they become an easy prey for the bolshevik propaganda, specially after the reds took over Russia in 1917. And let's not forget that Greece finally declared war on us on June 1917.
Our enemies know all of this, and three French divisions, along with the Serbian Second Army, are preparing their final assault on Macedonia. They have gathered massive amounts of artillery and soon they will attack our defences. If they break them, it will be the end: they will force us to sue for peace.
You are our last hope. Do your best and stop the enemy. If you succeed, who knows? Maybe we'll be able to retake the initiative in Macedonia after three years.

Victory conditions: Take all VHs.

Special note: With a TV or a loss, Bulgaria will ask for an armistice.
