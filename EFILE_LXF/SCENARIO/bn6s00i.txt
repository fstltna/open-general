
PEARL HARBOR - 7 Dec 1941

Pearl Harbor, Hawaii Territory
CO Admiral Husband E. Kimmel

Pearl Harbor is under attack! Bring your fighter in the air and intercept as many enemy planes as possible!

You can only lose this mission - what, that is stupid? - Okay, if you manage to shoot down at least 3 enemy units, you will be granted with a tactical victory. But if your core fighter suffered heavy losses and threatens to be destroyed, draw him back in time - via one of the Air Exit points!

In this mission exceptionally the Japanese makes the first move!


THE STORY

At dawn on December 7, 1941, 2nd Lt. Welch and another pilot, 2nd Lt. Ken Taylor, were coming back from a Christmas dinner and dance party (with big band orchestra) at a rooftop hotel in Waikiki, that ended in an all-night poker game. They were still wearing mess dress when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. Welch telephoned an auxiliary Haleiwa Fighter Strip on Oahu's North Shore to have two Curtiss P-40B Tomahawk fighters prepared for takeoff. He and Taylor immediately drove his Buick at high speed to Haleiwa in order to join the air battle.

Taking off with only 30 cal ammo in the wing guns, Welch claimed two kills of Aichi D3A Val dive bombers over Ewa Mooring Mast Field. The first enemy aircraft was only damaged and it made it back to its carrier while the second was finished off by Ken Taylor, shortly before he landed at Wheeler Field to get 50 cal ammo for his two cowl guns. On his second sortie, Welch shot down a Val (which was behind Ken Taylor) and the Val crashed in the community of Wahiawa, then Welch got one Mitsubishi Zero fighter about five miles west of Barbers Point.
