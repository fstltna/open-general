General, take a drink. We have plenty. After all harsh battles in past and this year we finally have broken resistence in the south of Russia, from Stalingrad to deep in the Caucasus. The Russians in the south have only a few isolated pockets of resistence. The Germans are shelling Grozny and together with our forces besiegings Baku. Your corps has been chosen to crack the pocket at the Black Sea port of Suchumi. The new 369th Croat Division and other forces will support you in the combined attack on Suchumi. The Russian defense consists of their 12th Army and old fortifications. These fortifiactions are mainly not placed in dept so a quick breakthrough at some sectors, instead of one at the entire front, is advised. Good luck, General.
