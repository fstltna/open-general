52 B.C. : Gergovia

.... Caesar has taken the important fortress town Avaricum and Vercingetorix had to retreat to Gergovia .....!

Caesars troops move up fast, and he probably plans to besiege Gergovia also. . . .

[The Supreme druid approaches towards you:] 
.... the  Haedui, under their king Litaviccus, have broken their alliance with the Romans and joined us!
My Prince, now it is up to the courageous Treveri!
We also join the great Gallic revolt! High Vercingetorix!
