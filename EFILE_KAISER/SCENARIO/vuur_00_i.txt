Kraaipan

Oct 12th, 1899

Although we tried to make an agreement with the British Empire about the rights of the uitlanders, the negotiations have failed. President Paul Kruger has declared war on the British. 
We must act quickly. Take your troops to Kraaipan station, defeat he British garrison and capture the armored train "Mosquito". It's full of rifles, ammunition and other supplies that will be extremely useful to our cause.

Victory conditions:
-Destroy both enemy MSUs.
-Your core MSU must survive.
