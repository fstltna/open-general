01. VIENNA (18 October 1938)

Eightteen Days have past since the start of this campaign and no-where on the entire front have we managed a breakthrough or a severe Czech defeat. On the other side we are not defeated as well and have managed to push the Czechs some kilometers back.

At our far right wing, in eastern Austria near Vienna, Czech elite forces managed to force the 53rd Landwehr division to retreat. The situation is escalating as the enemy has almost reached Vienna, one of the Reich's capital cities. The news that Vienna is captured by Czech forces, even despite its low military value, would be devastating to the already low moral. We must drive the Czechs back!

Elements of 53rd Landwehr try to slow the Czechs down as best as possible. Currently we only have a police unit, the SS-Der Fuehrer regiment, around Vienna. We cannot trust the city to a couple of policemen! Your regiment is at the moment the only one close and mobile enough to reach Vienna on time. Race to the city and hold the city! Reinforcements are underway.
