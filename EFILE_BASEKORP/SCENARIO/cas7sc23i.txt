General, as you well know Rommel has been fighting in Africa for about a year now, and has managed to stop the British at El Agheila. Now he is surging forward and is approaching Tobruk. However we consider it very unlikely that he will take it because British opposition is simply much too strong. Our solution is to form a giant Kessel by taking Egypt from the north. On our way through Lebanon and Syria we have been able to liberate the interned French forces which will help us in Egypt.
