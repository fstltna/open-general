Excellent work Herr General! Due to your brilliant leadership, the resources of the Donets Basin are now ours. About General Halder: His talk with the Fuhrer has had some success! The Fuhrer has promised to keep a close watch on your 6th Armee's progress, and to strengthen your exposed position on the steppe, he has ordered the 4th Panzer Armee to turn around and rejoin the Drive to the Volga!
