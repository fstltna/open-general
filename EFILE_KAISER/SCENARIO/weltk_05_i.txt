Loos: Hohenzollern-Redoute

Sep 25th, 1915

Just as we feared, the British have launched a massive autum offensive near Loos, with the intention of breaking through our defences and forcing us to fight in the open. They'll stop at nothing to succeed. They're even using poisonous gas, those barbaric islanders!

The British offensive has been well planned, but it seems that they're being too slow executing it. That could give us the precious time we need to send our reserves to the open gaps and contain the enemy swarm. Right now one of the most dangerous zones is our observation position at the Hohenzollern Redoute, a series of fortifications and trenches near Auchy-les-Mines. The British know that it's one of our strong defence points, so they've sent some of their best troops to conquer it. We count on you to defend the redoubt at all costs and to defeat our enemies.
