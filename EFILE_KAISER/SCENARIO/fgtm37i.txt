Kop, July 1 1915
Gospodin General-Leitenant, following the redeployment of the IV Kavkaz Corps toward its objective of flanking the Erzerum fortress from the south, the groups under your command (Voropanov and Mudry) must break the Turkish line along the Kop-Dag Ridge.  Two additional groups, Isarlov and Abatsiev, have sent their cavalry detachments along the Eastern Euphrates to capture Sheikh Bridge:  contact with them is expected within days.  General Sharpantier-who is covering your flank along the northern shores of Lake Van-will also be reinforcing your assault with several Cossack sotni within days.

The Turkish command has perceived the threat to Erzerum and redeployed the Halil-Bei Corps (3rd and 5th Mixed Divisions, various Kurdish detachments) in a defensive stance along the entire ridge.  Scouts report that the Halil-Bei Corps has been brought up to strength and is defending well-prepared positions.  Along the entire front Turkish resistance has stiffened:  we must maintain the initiative in our hands, Gospodin General-Leitenant!
