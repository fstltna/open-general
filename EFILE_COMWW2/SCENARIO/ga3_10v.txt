Good work Colonel. Even though the remnants of the encircled Soviet divisions managed to escape destruction by fleeing into the forests, we managed to capture most of their heavy equipment! All fronts are now stabilized and......Excuse me a moment......Colonel!, I have just now been informed that Stalin will accept Marshal Mannerheim's proposal for an armistice if we cut all diplomatic ties with Germany, and German troops are given a deadline of September 15 to withdraw from Finnish soil or be interned and handed over to the Soviet Union as POWs. This war of continuation is as good as over!
