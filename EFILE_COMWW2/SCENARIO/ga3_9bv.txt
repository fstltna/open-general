Excellent work Major, excuse me, I mean Colonel! The Soviet attack has been defeated, and they are now transferring their best troops to Estonia, to fight the Germans there. It appears the Soviets are coming to the conclusion that conquering Finland will be extremely difficult, and not worth the cost. We have received word from our Swedish friends that Stalin is now willing to discuss peace terms with us. Nevertheless, we now need you to begin immediately making your way further north, towards Ilomantsi, where, based on the latest recon reports, an as yet indeterminant number of Soviet troops appear to be moving in an aggressive fashion towards us...
