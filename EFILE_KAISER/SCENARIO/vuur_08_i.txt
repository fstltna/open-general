Elandsrivier

August 4th, 1900

At Brakfontein Drift near the Elandsrivier there is a British supply dump which is being guarded by a garrison of 500 Australian and Rhodesian soldiers. General Kitchener is almost two weeks away from them. Thus, their only real chance of relief is a small column of Australians that will come from the west in a few days. We can deal with them, so we should have enough time for defeating the Australians and for taking their supplies.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.
- Your MSU core unit must survive.
