Adwa - Mar 1st, 1896

"And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer"
Rev. 6, 2

The Italian commander, General Baratieri, was a veteran and competent soldier. After the battles of Amba Alagi and Mekele, he had learnt that our army clearly outnumbered his, but that our main weakness was logistics. Supply lines were almost non-existent, and our soldiers had to eat and drink whatever they could find on the field. Just like in the Middle Ages. Ethiopia was trying hard to become a modern country, but many of our ways were really primitive.

Baratieri decided that, instead of giving battle, he could simply sit and wait. Once the resources of Northern Ethiopia were depleted, Emperor Menelik would be forced to disband his army, and then the Italians could retake their offensive without any serious opposition. It was a simple and clever plan, and it would have worked.

It was lucky for us that the Italian politicians were incompetent fools. They wanted a quick, big and nice military victory, so they rejected Baratieri's plan and forced him to advance towards Adwa, where Menelik was staying. It was just in time, because our army only had supplies for another three of four days, at best.

Ras Alula's scouts spotted the Italian brigades soon after they started its march on February 29, so the Ethiopian forces were ready. The Tigrayans, led by Ras Mengesha, Ras Alula and myself, were on the left flank. On the centre, we had the warriors of Ras Mikael of Wollo, including the Oromo cavalry, and the Harar forces of Ras Makonnen. The righ flank was formed with soldiers from Gojjam, and their king Tekle Haymanot was at the front with them. Finally, on the reserve, there were the warriors from Shewa and the Semien, commanded by Emperor Menelik and Empress Taytu.

The Italians had divided their forces in three brigades, plus the reserve. Each column intended to advance parallel to the others, so at any time they could receive support from their comrades if they needed it. But they had to march during the night, over mountain terrain and with inaccurate maps, so at the next day's dawn the Italian units found themselves scattered across several miles. It was a perfect opportunity for defeating them in detail, and we got ready. The future of Ethiopia would be decided in the next hours.

Take all the VHs.
