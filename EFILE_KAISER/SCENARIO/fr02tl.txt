Madagascar Expedition - Tsarasoatra - June 29th, 1895 - L

Colonel Bertaux-Levillain, you have not been able to defeat the Hova Army. Now we have to retreat towards the coast and wait for reinforcements, which means that our troops can expect many more months of service here in Madagascar. I know you have been weakened by disease and nobody will make you responsible for this disgraceful defeat. You are ordered to return home for full recovery.
