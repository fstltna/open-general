AFTERMATH

The division had hopes of being deployed on the Kuban but instead it got transported by rail to Saloniki in northern Greece. Within weeks the division got transported to the Greek island of Crete.

On 15 October 1942 the three Infanterie Regimenten were re-named to Grenadier Regimenten. 

With the exception of few incidents with Cretan partisans and British aircraft, the division had an easy time on Crete until the surrender of Italy in September 1943.
