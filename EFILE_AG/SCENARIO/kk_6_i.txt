Battle of Arausio

6th October 105

Boiorix, your way has led you to Gaul where the Romans still rule.
Defeat the forces of proconsul Quintus Servilius Caepio and consul Gnaeus Mallius Maximus.

Notes of historical interest:

The migrating people of Teutons, Cimbri and Ambrorer under the leadership of their Kings Boiorix and Teutobod marched along the Rhone valley as far as  Arausio. 
Here they were cornered by two Roman armies. 
One under the command of Proconsul Quintus Servilius Caepio and the other under Consul Gnaeus Mallius Maximus. 

Since they were unable to agree on a joint approach
The Romans suffered one of the most devastanting defeats in their history...
