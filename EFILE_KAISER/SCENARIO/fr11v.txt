The First World War - Verdun: Bois des Caures - February 24th, 1916 - V

Général, when all seemed lost and whole divisions vanished in panic and chaos, your calm, but determined leadership saved the day once again. Joffre and every Frenchman praises your great service to our nation. The Germans seem to be even more exhausted and worn out than our brave troops. They will continue their attack soon, there's no doubt about it. But right now, let'st take a deep breath and raise our glasses in honour of our comrades who made the greatest sacrifice and perished in the inferno, fighting until the end. Adieu, Colonel Emile Driant!   


HISTORICAL EVENTS:
1916-FEB-21. "Unternehmen Gericht" (Operation Judgement), the German attack on Verdun, begins with a 10-hour artillery bombardment of nearly 1,000 guns of all calibres, followed by the advance of the three infantry coprs, spearheaded by new 'stormtrooper' and flamethrower units. While most of the French 1st line is either destroyed by artillery fire or overrun by infantry, Colonel Emile Driant and his two battalions of Chasseurs delay the German advance in the Bois des Caures for nearly 2 days, before he and most of his men are killed.

1916-FEB-25. Fort Douaumont, the largest and highest fort of the Verdun defences, is entered and occupied without a fight, by a small German raiding party.

1916-FEB-27-29. The German advance slows down due to exhaustion, high casualties, and 
the arrival of French reinforcements. Verdun is saved.
