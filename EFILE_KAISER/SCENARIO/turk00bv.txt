Battle of Velestino - Brilliant Victory

Congratulations!! You have forced the Greeks to retreat. Now it's time to chase them, so they can't recover.

Historical outcome
The Greeks held their own throughout the day. After nightfall, however, with his line of retreat being threatened, Colonel Smolenski withdrew to Volo, where he embarked his troops on May 7th.
