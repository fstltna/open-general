The Plattensee offensive - March 1945 BV

Your forces are well under way to Budapest. The Bolsheviks are astounded by the success of your offensive against their over-extended forces. Stalin has indicated he wants to negotiate a peace settlement. This will bring peace to Europe and will save our country. You performed wonderfully General.

HISTORY
