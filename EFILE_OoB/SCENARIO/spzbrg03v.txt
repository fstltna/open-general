"My commendations, comrade Hauptmann, although I'm really saddened that it weren't mine tankmen to enter the city. But our liberation campaign is not over yet, and the Red Army will surely take many other victories!

Comrade Hauptmann, I'll be pleased to keep a guard of honor during your tomorrow leave. But before then, lets violate the regulations a bit! After all, I'm of higher rank, hahaha!

Aleksey! Bring us some vodka!"
