1-8-1927, Nanchang, Jiangxi, SE China.

[Your speech to your men before the action]

Brave soldiers under my command!  The so-called ''united front'' with the Kuomingtan is over.  Today we will join the revolution against the ancient oppressors of the Chinese people and against the likes of Chiang-Kai-Shek.  Some of our comrades in other army units will also join us in our glorious uprising against the enemies of the people.  They are just now coming here to help us in the assault on the old city of Nanchang!  The end of the oppression, the capitalism, and the humiliations begins here on the West bank of the Gan River!  We are surrounded by the local warlords KMT troops, but our comrades will attack them from different directions, and the victory will be ours!

Men long live the revolution!
