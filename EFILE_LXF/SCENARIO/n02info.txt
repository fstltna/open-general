TAEJON (16 July 1950)

It looks like the United Nations has made good on their threats.  They have blockaded our ports and we have suffered the first bombardments from American aircraft.  Also we have recently encountered American ground units at Osan.  Reconnaissance has shown that the capitalists have deployed units in the direct line of your advance on Taejon, which might be of divisional strength.  However our People's Army has not been defeated and will not be defeated!

Comrade, you will take Taejon and advance next on Pusan.  Our 3rd division will frontally assault the American positions at the Kum River while you flank the Americans. This should force the retreat of the capitalists or it will result in their complete destruction!  We will meet in Taejon this time, Comrade General!
