Your loss is no surprise commander, the Philippines has fallen and MacArthur has run away to Australia. It is too bad you had to take so many fine boys down with you. Luckily for you, the Navy managed to get some submarines in to rescue you and what was left of your outfit. Washington requested a court-martial, but MacArthur has interceded on your behalf. Your remaining units have been refitted and sent to Hawaii to await your return.
