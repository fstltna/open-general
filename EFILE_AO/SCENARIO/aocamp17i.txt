Greenland Ice Sheet
December 22nd, ????
---------------------------------------
The eggheads have taken us back in time to the original location of the time machine, Commander.  Nobody knows exactly when (though the reader's glitched to 1955), but we know it's before the existence of the Roman Empire, so the odds are that you aren't going to run into anyone else out here.  Anyone human, anyway.

What we need to do here, Commander, is wipe out every trace of this time machine ever having existed.  The eggheads believe that our actions at Antietam created a weaker United States that succumbed to a nuclear war with the USSR, and that if we eliminate Pegasus and his machines, we can successfully avoid the future we just came from.

Don't worry too much, Commander; the eggheads also think that our time machine is "ripple-proof" or some such bullshit.  I guess what that means is that we're not going to spontaneously erase ourselves or the machine from the timeline by wiping out Pegasus before we ever got the machine to begin with.

They've also been able to spontaneously reproduce three or so of the Pegasus vehicle designs in the machine's vehicle factory.  If you're willing to take a chance with some unknown equipment, it might be helpful to acquire some of these for our force.

And now that we have the USS Iowa, it can help us in the siege.

Get out there and get the job done, commander.  Wipe Pegasus, his machine and his factories off the face of the planet.
