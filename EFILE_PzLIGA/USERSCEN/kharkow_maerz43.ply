Kharkov March 1943

In February 1943, the Red Army starts a substantial offensive for the reconquest of Kharkov, the third biggest city of the Soviet Union. Hitler demands the defender of the city and commander of the IIth SS Panzerkorps, Oberstgruppenfuehrer Paul Hausser, to hold Kharkov under all circumstances and to fight "up to the last cartridge". If this instruction is obeyed there is the menace of a second Stalingrad and the loss of irreplaceable armored elite divisions. Under these circumstances Hausser refuses the order and withdraws his troops from the city on February 15.
Incredible: an SS officer ignores his Supreme Commanders' order! Hitler gets furious but cannot make the "cowardly traitor" come to Berlin in that precarious situation. The decision to use the Pz.Korps in a defensive way outside Kharkov proves as correct. The Russian attack bursts at the persistent resistance of the Panzergrenadiere, and only 2 weeks, later Hausser's divisions are ready to attack the city again. The third battle for Kharkov begins!
