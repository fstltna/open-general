The First World War - Spring Offensive - The River Matz Riposte - June 10th, 1918 - TV

The victory is ours, mon Général! The enemy didn't expect our counter-attack and was demoralized by our overwhelming numbers of tanks. Their own A7V were too few and too cumbersome to make any significant impact on the battlefield. I wonder what a German army could do with a proper tank force. We hopefully will never find out...
