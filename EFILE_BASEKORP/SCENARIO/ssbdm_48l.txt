"Get ahold of the Carrier" Heydrich shouted.He was told it was going under,the Americans had converged to cut off the running ships.The SS Air Korps HO-229 Fighters had ruled the Skies for a few minutes but now out of ammunition their Pilots baled as the Jets went into the Sea.SS KM Pikar Wohr was now the Target for the Americans arsenal of weapons.American ships,subs and planes attacked with no mercy.The 'Wohr hit the Arizona with a few shells but took hits too from the West Virginia and the Nevada.As the Arizona limped off under a Smoke screen the subs 'Tang and 'Stingray sent a mass of torpedoes into the 'Wohr.It was over,this Madness of the SS 'Master Race had met It's Equal,actually It's Superior in the Forces of the United States of America.The First step in making things Right had been made.The Germans at home would take the Second step,all SS would be imprisoned on President Erwin Rommels orders.It would take a few years to make a better World Free from Oppression and all working to make Mankind better instead of trying to put some aloft above the others as the SS had.SS 1 Heydrichs body was never found.
