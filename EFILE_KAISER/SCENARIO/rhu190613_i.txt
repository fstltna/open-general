Defending Érsekújvár (Nové Zámky)

June 13, 1919

Ah, dear Comrade Commisar, have you got the dedicated copy of Lenin's The State and Revolution? Comrade Szamuely has just arrived from Moscow with the warmest greetings and this special present for you. Our international revolution is going well, our Slovakian comrades will declare their Soviet Republic within days. Unfortunately these pesky Czech marauders simply can't accept their defeat, and they launched a strong counterattack in the area of Nyitra (Nitra) - Vág (Váh) - Garam (Hron) rivers. Give these imperialist lapdogs a bloody nose again!

ORDER: Hold at least 3 VHs and keep your MSU alive.
