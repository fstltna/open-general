Brief to Anzac Commander.

With the 4-day artillery barrage coming to an end, a 20-minute pause preceeded the detonation of the mines.  The German troops rushed out of their dugouts to man the trenches -- only to be caught by the most massive man-made explosion in history.  The detonation of the mines - audible as far as Dublin - ensured early success.

Despite violent counter-attacks, your troops have routed the German defenders all along the ridge and have attained all of their objectives.
