I've needed the help of our fresh troops, but the Terek is in our hands. Some Soviet units have fled to the steppes of Astrakhan, where they'll hardly get any supplies, so they won't be able to bother us there.
Some Chechen and Ingush guerrillas still roam the mountains of the Caucasus, but they aren't very powerful. The local cossack garrisons will handle them. I wish there was a way to convince them to join our army, but I think it's unlikely to happen. Anyway, that isn't too important. Now I just have to think about reinforcing our Northern front.

My troops must go there as soon as possible. We'll rest a couple of days in Novorossiysk and then we'll march to the Manych. The Soviets have launched a very dangerous counterattack there, that might split our forces in two.
