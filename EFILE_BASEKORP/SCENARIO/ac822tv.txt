Marshall!

The people celebrate your rescue!

Your forces gave the Germans a rough handling as they withdrew.  Thankfully we captured enough Germans to make a large trade of POWs - bringing many of our men home.

This operation has proven to the world that Italia is NOT a bunch of Mussilinni drones, but a nation of men.

Thank you - my son was among the POWs.  Although he looks awful, he is alive.
