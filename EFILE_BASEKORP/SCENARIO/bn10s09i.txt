
MERSA MATRUH - 26 APR 1941

Sollum, Egyptian/Libyan border

An interesting development - in secret negotiations we managed to pull the Egyptians on our site. Now an Egyptian Brigade at Mersa Matruh blocked the harbor and depots and denied supplies for the Commonwealth troops. This bad news forces the Commonwealth's to withdrew from the Egyptian/Libyan border - they rely on the supplies at Mersa Matruh and will try to get this harbor back. Take advantage of the situation and advance to Mersa Matruh, as long as the Egyptians will be able to hold out!

GOAL: Take all VH's!
