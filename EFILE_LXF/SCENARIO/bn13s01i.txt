
SAAR II - 16 OCT 1939

Our strategic situation is not as good as it was a few weeks ago. Poland has collapsed and soon the bulk of the German Army will be concentrated in the West. For this reason our bridgehead over the Saar River is useless and we will retreat back into our Maginot Line.

We have about nine divisions in the Saar region, mon General. To let them safely retreat, your force will act as rearguard. You must stop possible German attacks and improve your current positions, if needed by counterattacks. Then wait for the order to retreat as well!

GOAL: Take all VH's!
