Herr General,
OKW has finally given orders for the annihilation of the BEF beachhead. The expected points of departure are around Dunkirk.

XIX Corps Battleplan:-

1. In conjunction with the rest of Army Group A you will advance from the south and west towards Dunkirk.

2. Army Group B will advance from the east. (Not on map)

3. Embarkation points around Dunkirk must be taken before the BEF can escape.

Player Note: In addition to capturing all Victory Hexes, all retreat hexes should be taken to prevent the escape of 15 enemy units in order to win the scenario. This is the original SSI scenario with a few little modifications.
Recomended purchase:- Air Defence, upgrades and overstrengthening.
Suggested Core:- 3x Tank, 1x Anti-Tank, 3x Infantry, 2x Recon, 2x Artillery, 1x Air Defence, 1x Fighter, 1x Tac Bomber (Including Protos).

Good luck.
