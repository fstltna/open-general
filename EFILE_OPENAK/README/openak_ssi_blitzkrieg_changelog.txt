2.1
- Fixed bonus unit not behaving as free core.
- Cleaned up the campaign flow - I hope...
- Fixed prototype time frame screw ups...
- Turned off prototypes for Volokolamsk because the only prototype that falls in the time frame sucks...
- Tweaked Allied unit experience and overstrength for Windsor 1940.

- Halved the prototype time frames, changed the early Windsor trigger prototype to match the appropriate prototype frame.
- Tweaked Allied unit experience and overstrength for Lillehammer.
- Took a bar of experience off the Republican armoured unit in the Madrid scenario.
- The scenarios that had base experience set to 100 (Windsor 1940, Savannah, Oak Ridge) for the Axis have had base experience set to 150 to represent the average of the random experience added to all a.i. and auxillary units.
- Scenarios where the Allies had a base experience of 100 have had that changed to 50.
- The a.i. for several of the late game scenarios has been set to aggressive.  This will make them more challenging.
- Savannah has been reworked to for playability and plausibility.
- This campaign now requires Open AK 0.314b or later.
- Additional units inside zone of control will make it more difficult to evade for units that have that ability.

- Made all the core forces match the main campaign character's nationality.
- Enabled upgrade and overstrength on supply hexes.
- Extensive a.i. tweaks, including recent a.i. features such as objective hexes.
- Although it is untested, it should be theoretically possible to play player 2 in scenarios against the a.i.

2.0
- The old SSI Blitzkrieg background music will now play for some of the scenarios.
- Open General version 0.90.33.0 or newer is now necessary for this campaign to play as intended.
- Version 0.306 or newer of the Open AK efile is now necessary for this campaign to play as intended.
- Introduced some historical elements to the Caen scenario.
- In scenarios with ports and/or naval units all ocean hexes within two of land have been changed to shallow sea.
- Ciechanow Polish airfield anomaly fixed.
- Parachute units now drop during the return to base phase for air units.
- Parachute units can no longer operate during bad weather.
- Enabled critical hits for naval units.
- Reinforcements arrive at the start of the player's turn, as opposed to at the start of the global turn.
- Ice cream and cake for taking brilliant victory in Race to Dunkirk.
- Enabled and added attachments.
- Added significant strategic hints and information to the campaign README file, as well as in specific scenario introductions.
- Changed victory condition time frames for campaign track decision scenarios to a tolerance of one turn per level.
- Adjusted end of scenario prestige awards.
- Adjusted prestige caps.
- Both the standalone scenarios and the campaign have now been tested at 100/100 difficulty ratings - previously I had tested the campaign at what I normally played the original modified version by Kristjan Ambroz, which was 50/200.  So the difficulty levels should now be much more sensible.
- New major version number due to the extent of the changes.
- A few text files no longer in use have been removed.
- Fuel, ammo and remaining move fixes for units which have changed.
- Fixes to settings which affect a.i., such as entrenchment and hold status, especially for air units and armoured/mechanized units.
- Changed the added mission range from 12 to 16 to account for greater distance between airfields in previously untested scenarios.
- I don't like the number five.
- Made most of the overstrength units consistent with overstrength unit rules.
- Made the turns per day consistent throughout the campaign.
- Adjusted prototype time frames.
- Set "punishment" scenarios as "no prototype" and removed the chance for a brilliant victory.  Brilliant victories become victories, etc.  This makes those scenarios more challenging.
- All of the scenarios for every campaign track have now been converted and tested.
- Many more scenario changes to adjust balance and difficulty for the campaign as well as standalone scenario gameplay.
- More map road and bridge fixes.
- Extensive standalone scenario testing, and similarly extensive standalone and head to head scenario adjustments.

Known Issues:
- Most ground units have not been checked for remaining move.
- Some research has been done but for the most and some attention has been payed to historical accuracy but a great deal more work could be done.  Note also that fun and playability always trump historical accuracy.
- While there has been a lot of play testing, changes have been made to scenarios that have not been thoroughly tested - especially the standalone scenarios.  None of the scenarios have been tested as head to head scenarios.  I did not play Konrad through to the end.  I like surprises too...

1.2
- Minor changes to compensate for map changes that increased difficulty.
- Fixed/changed miscellaneous map road errors/interpretations.

1.1
- Added more missing text files and renamed some text files that were missed in 1.0.
- Made fronts and factions much more specific.
- Edited almost every scenario to clean up details such as unit facing and for balance and variety in units, as well as cleaned up many more anachronistic units and fixed issues such as mismatched transports and units with incorrect nationality.  The campaign now passes the check units functionality of Open Suite.
- Updated to version 0.297 of the Open AK efile.
- More changes to make the scenarios playable as standalone scenarios.

Known Issues:
- Scenarios on campaign tracks not commonly taken have not been given as much attention, or tested, nor have standalone scenarios been tested either against the a.i. or in head to head human play.
