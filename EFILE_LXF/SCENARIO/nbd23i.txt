Our next target is the Japanese airstrips at Biak.  There should be little resistance to you assault as the garrison is reportedly quite small.  However, radio intercepts confirm that the Japanese are preparing a relief mission dubbed "Operation Kon" to relieve Biak in the event of an invasion. We must strike now before Truk can ship in reinforcements.
