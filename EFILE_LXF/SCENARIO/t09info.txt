We have quickly advanced through the plains of Georgia and have reached the Caucasus mountains in the north and are close to capture Tblisi, the centre of the Caucasus and of huge importance to both parties. Your forces might be exhausted, but this is not the time to delay. You must advance even further and take Tblisi and the mountain passes going north to Grozny and east to Baku. Reinforcements are underway. The Russians have not much fighting power left and use their last resources in the area to stop you. Prevail, General!
