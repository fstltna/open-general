Congratulations on your successful escape from Finland, Herr General.  Rapid developments over the past few months have caused the General Staff to forget your failure there.  You are given one last chance - to play an important role in our invasion of France.  Their army is said to be the world's finest.  We shall see!  Now, we believe the Allies plan to push into Belgium in response to our offensive.  Your task is to lead your forces through the Ardennes and emerge behind the enemy.  Our victory at Sedan in 1870 made Germany a Great Power.  Your victory at Sedan will return us to that status.
