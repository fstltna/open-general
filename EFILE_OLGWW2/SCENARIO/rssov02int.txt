Trans-Siberian Railroad Attack

August, 1944

Finally, those officers from Tokyo will be happy knowing we are going to strike the Soviets in Far East Siberia.  Your command, as well as some troops from Manchukuo, will take part in the Vladivostok operation.  The plan is to cut the Trans-Siberian Railway and any surrounding communications to isolate the port city of Vladivostok.  Then your units will drive to the South towards Vladivostok.

As you know, since you have some experience against the soviets in 1938, they will be a rough enemy.  Their use of heavy artillery units will again be a major problem. 

We also hope to find anti-soviet elements in the population of the conquered areas or even in the enemy army units.  Our plan is to set up of an anti-soviet ''independent'' republic there, the Primurski Republic, like in the 20s.
