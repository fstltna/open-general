Szolnok-Mezöhegyes Offensive

July 19, 1919

The imperialists fooled us. They promised the Romanian troops would withdraw behind the demarcation line declared on March 20 in exchange for our withdrawal from the Fölvidék (Upper Hungary). But the enemies of our communist revolution broke their words, and their Romanian mercenaries are still staying behind the Tisza. It's time to teach these truce-breakers a hard lesson and liberate our proletarian sisters and brothers by force! Lead our troops to victory, Comrade Commisar!
