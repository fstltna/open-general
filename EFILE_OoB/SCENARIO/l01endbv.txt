BRILLIANT VICTORY

You have lead your men bravely in a battle that was never in our favour. In the midst of chaos you have prevailed in preventing the destruction of your units, in which the enemy was near. The Netherlands have resigned and contact has been made with 9. Panzer Division.


AFTERMATH

Your division gets rest and refitting as part of the occupation force in Belgium and Holland. January 1941 the division is back in Germany but in April already the division is brought to Rumania as part of the German military mission to that country.
