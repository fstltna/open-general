TACTICAL VICTORY

On the Ethiopian side the expectations of a second Adowa were beginning to fade. These Italians unlike their fathers were brave men, "gobos", their artillery was powerful, and their planes piloted by "Mussolini Lijj" flew low and boldly. 

Badoglio remained at Makalle, weighing up the lessons of the battle. He concluded that though the Ethiopian army had been modernized, the progress made had been "superficial rather than profound". The leadership was still in the hands of the Rases, of "churchmen" like Ras Kassa and "irresolute leaders" like Ras Seyum. The tactics were the traditional Ethiopian mass attack, not the most dangerous guerrilla warfare for which Ras Imru alone had shown the slightest aptitude.

Neither side took many prisoners. In the whole campaign the Ethiopians took only five, four of them at the Pass of Dembeguina. They were well enough treated, sent to Dessie where the Emperor used them as gardeners. But five was an unbelievably small total.

There were no half-regrets on either side at shedding the blood of fellow-Christians.
