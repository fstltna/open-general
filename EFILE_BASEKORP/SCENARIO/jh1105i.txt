Our objective is Alexandria, the great port of Egypt.  With Alexandria in our possession supply will cease to be a problem.  The British are present in great strength and strongly entrenched, but your past performance indicates that you should be able to overcome them.  They will be supported by the remnants of the British armor, and resupplied British aviation.  The Russians have begun a major offensive in the Kursk region so you must achieve your objectives quickly.
