Good to see you, Majuri!  
This morning the expected soviet all-out offensive in the Summa area has begun.
Situation report: After massive artillery bombardments the Soviets are assaulting our fortifications at Summa.
Enemy: The 24th, 123rd, 90th, 138th and 100th Rifle divisions have been identified. There appears to be massive Soviet armor and their air force is very active. To their advantage the weather is improving and I was told that the Soviets threw soldiers out of planes. Hmm...
Our forces: Your group, 3rd and 1st Divisions. We must trust in the quality of our local fortifications.

Hold the fronts and counterattack as soon as possible. Your opponent is supposed to be Timoshenko. Rumors! Anyway, your rival is no rookie.
