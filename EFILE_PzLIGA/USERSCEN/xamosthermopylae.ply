Xamos Thermopylae 

Greece, 14th of april 1941    19 turns

After a unstoppable seeming advance the german tank divisions are not far away from their victory in Greece.
But to be able to advance to Athen, the heavy fortified positions in the Thermopylen must be taken first.
This last naturell fortification is defended by experienced and rugged fighting australian/newzealand troops.
But will their will stand successful against the german storm?

This scenario is a historical more correct alternative for the known SSI-original. The used units, its strength and equipment as well as the names are  - as usual - 95% equal to then conditions. Now it is entirely up to you!
