TACTICAL VICTORY

Brilliant, comrade. Simply brilliant! You have chased those fascists dogs in front of you. Large parts of the Caucasus region have been liberated. And the fascists in Stalingrad should be close to surrender. We have destroyed many Rumanian, Hungarian and Italian units in battles near the Don River. Our winter offensive is already a triumph. Simply keep advancing until you receive new orders, comrade!
