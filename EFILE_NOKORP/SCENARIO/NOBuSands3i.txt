Generalleutnant, it's good you came that quickly. We have bad news from down south. 
We did expect the Italians wouldn't be able to withstand the British counterattack in Egypt. What we didn't expect though is that they would get totally overrun: Their whole 10th Army was destroyed, and the British have not only forced them out of Egypt, regaining all the terrain you had conquered, they are now chasing them out of Libya!
We can neither allow the British to capture Libya, nor can we let them annilhilate the Italians, who are already in trouble in the Balcans due to their bungled invasion of Greece. Our duty is to help our allies.

Fortunately that Africa Force we were talking about is ready at last. Now where do you fit in might you ask. Well, initially that force was supposed to be commanded by Hans von Funck, but he is in disgrace right now; Erwin Rommel was suggested instead, but you have ample experience dealing with both the difficult terrain and the Italians, and have shown great promise so far. So we settled on you to command that force, congratulations! We're sending you back, you have to stop the British and push them back, all the way to Egypt and beyond. Failure is not an option. 

Those new troops will be already there when you arrive, as are still your old troops. You also get one Italian Auto-Saharan Company, they are specialised in long range patrols of the desert and will come handy for scouting and raiding.
Beware, the British have a strong and mobile tank force, and the Italian troops left are worn out and won't be much of a help.


Instructions: Capture all VHs. As before, you command the Italians and your own troops. You get several new core units for free, including some Italian ones.
