"But Sir,the SS has a new tank"."Look Commander,what options have We got.The fuel trucks are burning from that 'Stuka attack.The bridge behind us has been blown by the Enemy.We got enough in Our fuel tanks for what,another 20 or 25 kilometers?What do You want to do,jump out of the tanks and have a picnik with these SS Girls?You want to sit there as they reach for the knife to butter your roll?They'll stick that Dam knife in Your eye then cut Your throat with it.I know some Guys have cut out figuring the War is lost and maybe it is,I don't know.But I know when those Guys get back to the Life as what they knew before it is going to be gone and replaced by suffering,misery and depression.Our Country is destroyed,People have been displaced in horrendous numbers.You saw it in Paris the thousands begging for nothing but a chunk of bread.And anytime the People heard a plane the terror in their eyes whether Ours or the SS/BdM's cos odds were it was the later.And No I don't blame the Brits  for holding onto their 'Spits but I believe they have made a grave mistake.With them here in large numbers We might have stood up to these 'Frau Whores but with Us folding the Brits will soon be getting all the Nazi's attention.We had the Finest Armee in the World.The Brits do not compare to Us.Bad decisions from the Top has destroyed Us,not this Incessant SS/BdM but now I would say They,the 'Fraus are the Finest Armee.Especially with that Air Korps.
