03. DNJESTR RIVER (16 July 1941)

To the commanding officer of 22. ID (LL):

Your division has reached the Dnjestr river near the town of Arionesti. On the other side of the river the enemy is known to be supported by fortifications of their so called Stalin Line. Your orders are to cross the river and advance to and capture Piscanka, an important center of communications. Again you will have to co-operate with a Rumanian division. Previous battles have shown that you are most excellent in doing so with our ally.


RULES: 
- Do not upgrade, sell or buy units - nor upgrading transports.
- Replacing lost units by buying new units is allowed. Replacements should be the exact same unit as the lost unit.
