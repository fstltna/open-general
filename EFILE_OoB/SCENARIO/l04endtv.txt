TACTICAL VICTORY

The crossing was a stunning success! The enemy threw in elements of at least six divisions supported by artillery to drive you back - in which they failed. Even more you drove the enemy army back in disarray. The crossing of the Dnjepr river is already one of the most glorious moments of the division! You are ordered to advance across the steppes towards the Perekop peninsula.
