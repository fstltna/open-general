Rheingold - May 1945

After the crushing blow that we dealt to the Western Allies in the Ardennes, our troops have been slowly pushed back behind the Rhein. 

After your stunning successes in the East, your division is getting some rest. It is broken up in Kampfgruppen and forms the mobile reserve of II FschJgr Korps that has taken position on the Eastern bank of the river Rhein. Monty's troops are on the other side of the river. 

Last week we were able to blow the bridge at Remagen after no more than a few hundred GI's had crossed it.  By doing so, we averted a crossing of the Rhein into mainland Germany. But now the Allies have launched two new offensives across the Rhein. The first 100 miles South of here by General Patton and an airborne and amphibious assault in your sector by mainly British forces.

Your task is to wipe out the paratroopers and to stop more troops from crossing the Rhein.
