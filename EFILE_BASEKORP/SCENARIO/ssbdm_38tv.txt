"What the Hell was that,Sdygnee"? "I believe General Collen that was one of those 'Horten Girls Batts"."Well if the Dam thing had crashed here We all would be dead,must of had a shitload of bombs on it.Let's get the Car and go see the wreckage".At the site 'Batt 104 was nothing but pieces and flames.A moment later showed up the Pilot and Co-pilot. Everyone had got out alive though Mylinda's chute had failed to open killing Her."I told You Kriss (the Co-pilot) these Dam things still got a long way to go before We work the Kinks out"."This makes what Hannah,4 out of the 12. I think the Project is too advanced,those Motors simply cannot stand the heat,not at full throttle just too much pressure generated.That's 2 out of the 4,Command is going to have to let Us Fly them the way We know not the Way some Dam Paper says.If they don't then We are all going to be Dead before it is over with".Frau General Collen walked Up to the Girls."I guess You were in that"? "Yes General,I'm Darla and this is Kriss.We were on a Bombing Mission over at Belegorod but the Bombs wouldn't release.On Our journey back to base the Engines cut out,no warning,no nothing.Just Kaput and We were lucky to be flying High enough to get the Hell out.SS/BdM Command is pushing Us too Hard.If they slack Up this Weapon will win the War and if they don't We will lose the War". "Oh I think the Frau's on the Ground might argue with You on that" Collen stated.Darla responded, "Not here General,against Amerika".
