We have achieved some intial success but it will not last.  The Russians have begun a counter-attack and we are once again back on the defensive.  For our failure we have been ordered to hand in our armbands which signify us as elite soldiers.....Dietrich has refused to carry out the order saying he would sooner shoot himself.

We must now face the inevitable - the war is over.
