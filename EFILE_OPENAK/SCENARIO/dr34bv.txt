Königsberg - January 1945 BV

Congratulations General. The SS panzer divisions, transported to the Eastern front after achieving great successes on the Western front, were able to stop the attack on Königsberg. Contact with Heeresgruppe Kurland is restored. Casualties amongst the attacking Soviet armies are enormous.
