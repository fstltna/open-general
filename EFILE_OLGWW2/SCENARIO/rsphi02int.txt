Luzon

December, 1941

Manila has fallen, the enemy didn't want to fight in the city, probably they were scared of our samurais, and they escaped running like rabbits!. To complete the clearing of Luzon island, you should drive to the South and take the enemy bases there. We think the Americans and their Philippine slaves won't be a problem, but you will have good air support anyway to achieve your goals quickly.

Kitto-Katsu!.
