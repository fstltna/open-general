LOSS
------------------------
What a disgrace, General! Allenby's plan was brilliant, but you completely ruined it.
I must inform you that you have been instantly relieved of your command. You are called back to London to give a full report of this operation. The Prime Minister has called you an "example of unbearable military incompetence", so don't expect to see further action in this war...
