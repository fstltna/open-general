
WINDSOR - 28 AUG 1940

Southwest of London, England

God is with us! The advance of the British Home Fleet into the English Channel was rejected by our Luftwaffe. After heavy losses the Royal Navy retreated to Scapa Flow and probably prepares a new attempt to disturbing our supplies.

But also at the invasion front decide successes were achieved. After the collapse of the important GHQ defense line further resistance is actually hopeless, but the Brits do not want to give up and retreated behind the so-called A-Stop-Line on the outskirts of London. The General Staff has decided to break this defense line at Windsor. There is the weakest point and there is our gateway to London. Heavy artillery is already assembled at this point and also our Luftwaffe is ready. Your battle group will form the spearhead of the attack. Repair at last one bridge to make the way free for the following divisions.

The General Staff gave the order to transform your force into a fully-motorized unit.

GOAL: Take all VH's!

Main reinforcements:
5th turn - west, 8th Infantry-Division
