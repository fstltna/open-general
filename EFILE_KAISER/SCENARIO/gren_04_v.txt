Our defective maps could have cost us most of the Guards brigade, but my soldiers gave a perfect example of why the British Army is renowned for its determination and courage. Although with some casualties, we took our objectives. The Boer could retreat to Graspan, where they would still harass other units of our division two days later. However, they couldn't stop our advance to Kimberley.

I soon developed a great deal of respect for the simple, but highly efficient tactics of those Dutch farmers. When they had to defend themselves, they dug trenches or took the nearby hills, and fired on our troops with remarkable accuracy. When we came too close to their positions, they retreated to secondary lines of defence, where they could keep on resisting our advance. If they had to attack, they were masters of the fire-and-movement technique. Excellent riders and shooters, they could move at great speed on the South African terrain, which they knew perfectly and used to their advantage. The lessons that I learnt in South Africa would be very useful to me during the Great War.
