General.

Your maneuver around the Polish right was a disaster!  Panzer Division Kempf was forced to produce your breakthrough, and they must halt to prepare to march on Warsaw.  OKW has shifted our Luftwaffe priority to other more successful sectors.

It is a pity we did not discuss your Spanish experiences.  Perhaps it could have helped to put them in todays perspective, but we will not get the chance.  Hitler himself has ordered that all non-German forces be withrawn from battle and sent home immediately.

I do not think it wise to return with your troops..........
