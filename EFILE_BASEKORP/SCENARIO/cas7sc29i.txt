Gibraltar is impossible to occupy, or so they say. We'll see about that. We were originally going to make this an operation starting from the Spanish mainland but we have found that the soil over there is too soft for our artillery. So you must land by sea. Our Kriegsmarine and the Italian Navy will support you, as well as some of the Fallschirmjaeger which you saved on Crete. They think they owe you this one!
