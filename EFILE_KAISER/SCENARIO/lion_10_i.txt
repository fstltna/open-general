Shire - Dec 8th, 1916

"I, in turn, will laugh at your calamity. I will mock when terror strikes you, when terror strikes you like a storm and your calamity comes like a whirlwind, when trouble and stress overcome you"
Prov. 1, 26- 27

We had reacted much faster than the Italians had expected, and the colonial battalions had left Ethiopia, but the menace was far from over. The best enemy units, composed exclusively of European soldiers, were still heading south, towards Shire and Gondar. They knew that it was unlikely that we could outflank them, since we didn't have been able to mobilize large numbers of warriors.

Initially, I thought about giving battle on the shore of the Uri River, but I soon rejected the idea. My forces could easily get trapped between the river and the three Italian columns that I knew that were approaching from the west, the north and the east. Instead, I ordered my troops to deploy near Shire, where they surely would have more mobility.

Victory conditions: 
Take all the VHs.
