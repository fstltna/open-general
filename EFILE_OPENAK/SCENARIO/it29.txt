PORT SAID May11 1943

After the fall of Alexandria and Cairo, British and American forces lead by Ike opened a second front in North Africa - Operation Torch. It took von Arnim many months to stabilize that front in Algeria and Tunisia using mainly German forces. 

The last few weeks more and more supplies have been diverted to Egypt, allowing our XX Corps to launch an offensive to capture Port Said at one end of the Suez Canal and allowing DAK to attack Suez at the other end. X and XXI Corps are moving South into the Sudan to recapture our lost colonies Ethiopia, Somaliland and Eritrea.

Notes: 
- There are 3 deployment hexes in the SW corner of the map.

News: 
- Operation Mars - Zhukov's attempt to eliminate the Rzhev salient and to encircle the German 9th Army near Moscow - has resulted in a complete Russian defeat.
- The Soviet Operation Little Saturn has - with the exception of our elite Alpini Corps - virtualy whiped out our VIII Army on the Eastern Front.
- The German Fourth Panzer Army's Stalingrad relief attempt gets stuck 16 miles of the city.
- General Giulio Martinat, chief-of-staff of our Alpini Corps in Russia was killed while personally leading a successful attack to break through Russian blocking positions at Nikolajevka, an attack which opened a path for our encircled troops, Germans and Hungarians to escape and regain Axis lines. A victory against all odds, with no artillery and no air support and on foot.
