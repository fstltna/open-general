
HAINAN - 9 FEB 1939

East off Hainan Island, South China
CO Admiral Nobutake Kondo

Our formidable supply blockade all along the coast of south, central and north China has a loophole via the Port of Samah on the southern end and makes the occupation of Hainan Island necessary. The island is only weakly defended and with the support of our Taiwan brigade, it should be no problem to take control of this island within a short time!

BACKGROUND

Escorting a convoy, the South China Naval Force (Fifth Fleet) commanded by Vice Admiral Kondo Nobutake entered and anchored in Tsinghai Bay on the northern shore of Hainan Island at midnight on 9 February 1939 and carried out a successful landing. In addition, Navy land combat units affected a landing at Haikou at 1200 on 10 February. Thereafter, the Army and Navy forces acted in concert to mop up the northern zone. On 11 February the land combat units landed at Samah (Sanya) at the southern extremity of Hainan Island and occupied the key positions of Yulin and Yai-Hsien. Thereafter, the units engaged in the occupation and subjugation of the entire island.
