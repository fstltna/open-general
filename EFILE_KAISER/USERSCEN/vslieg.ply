The fortresses of Liege  

August 4, 1914

Our First, Second and Third Armies must move through Belgium to reach Paris. The Belgian King Albert has rejected our ultimatum for free passage, so now the city of Liege, its fortresses and the Belgian 3rd Infantry Division that is sent to bolster the Liege defences are blocking our way West. 

Six strengthened infantry brigades are taken from the First, Second and Third Armies to form Armeegruppe Meuse and are instructed to take the city. They are accompanied by 3 cavalry divisions that are to sweep around Liege and cut it off from the main body of the Belgian Army.
