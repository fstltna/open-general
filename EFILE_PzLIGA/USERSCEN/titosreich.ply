In Tito's Territory

Colonel,
we have detected some partisans on both sides of the railway line.
Your mission is to destroy these bandit groups. Do not show mercy and disperse these elements.
For this mission I put all troops in this sector under your command. Our troops are better equiped and trained. But the 'Abwehr' (intelligence) says the partisans are under the brutal command of Tito himself. Consequently they won't retreat.
It's your duty to fulfill the mission in any case.

Have a good chase, Colonel!
---------------------------------------------------
Commander,
our scouts report that the Germans prepare for a new offensive against our troops on both sides of the railway line.
Their new commander, a certain Colonel von ..., is said to be very resolute. But we are well prepared. And our biggest trump is the knowledge of the terrain.
So, take all the troops and charge your attack before the German one. Interrupt the railway line and take the objects before the german hounds and their traitorous auxiliaries can reach their goals.

Kill them all!
