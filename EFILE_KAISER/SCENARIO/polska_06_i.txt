Germans flee!

November 11th, 1918

By the summer of 1918, the Germans had failed to conquer France. In autumn, the Entente army under General Frenchet d'Esperey overran the Balkans. This took Bulgaria, Turkey, Hungary and Austria out of the war. Also, the Germans had to sign a ceasefire agreement. The Great War was over.
 
The Polish government broke their bonds with Germany in October but were afraid that Polska Sila Zbrojna would be too weak to stop the bolshevik revolutions in the German Army stationed in Poland. On November 10th, Józef Pi³sudski returned from Germany, where he was imprisoned, and started another uprising with his veterans and the POW conspiracy. It was the most succesful uprisnig ever! No one was shot! Although a few Germans were scared to death. On November 11th Warsaw was free!
 
The German Governor, General von Beseler, escaped on a river boat. You should stop him.

Victory conditions: Destroy the German HQ unit. Keep 1. pu³k piechoty alive. Keep the recon airplane alive. 

Intelligence report: Beseler's ship scuttled somwhere on the islands of the Vistula River. The plane will speed up the action. As the plane's fuel and ammo is limited, build an airfield with the pioneers for resupplying it. 

Good Luck!

Note: You got a recon-bomber, which doesn't count against the prestige cap! Take care of it.
