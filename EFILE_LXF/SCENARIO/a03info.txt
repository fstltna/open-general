03. LINZ 2 (29 March 1938)

Welcome back to the Linz sector, General. Although we have been able to hold the enemy at the Traun River Line, the pressure of the last few days has been too much. The divisions defending the line from north of Linz to the Salzach Valley have suffered heavy losses. The 1st, 2nd, 5th and most elements of 3rd Infantry Divisions are retreating to the Enns River where we hold the Germans at a new and last line before falling back to Vienna. The Germans seem to have an endless reserve of men - which we clearly do not possess.

Elements of 3rd Infantry Division and your force will cover the retreat of the other divisions. The fortifications of the Traun Line have been heavily bombarded by artillery and bombers. They will not be able to hold out long. Nor will you. You have orders to at least hold out two days, and then fully retreat yourself.

NOTE: HOLD OUT FOR 10 TURNS AND YOU WILL CONTINUE TO THE NEXT SCENARIO. GOAL IS TO HOLD YOUR CORE UNITS ALIVE.
