You're far behind the Polish defense! Coil back to the lines of contact and attack the rear of the enemy!  Air recon says that the Poles are holding the bridge! You must capture it intact, understand?! Once you secure the bridge, follow further south, still further south! Poles are retreating towards you! You must clear the whole area!
