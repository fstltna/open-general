Construction began in 1936 and she was almost finished by the start of WWII, but due to shifting priorities remained unfinished.
Initially Graf Zeppelin was to be the lead ship in a class of 4 carriers, but after WWII started the last two were cancelled, and of the first two, which were already under construction, the second was broken up in the slipway. Only Graf Zeppelin survived as a floating work in progress till the end of the war, when she was scuttled near Stettin.

Unlike most carriers, the Graf Zeppelin had a cruiser type armament (150 mm guns)  and could fight on her own.
