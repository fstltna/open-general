Campaign Introduction by Jan Hedström for version 3.1
December 2010

1. Campaign introduction
This is an update of my conversion of Maarten Folker's campaign November 42 to the LatinGenerals efile.

2. Special requirements for playing this campaign
2.1 If this is your first user-made campaign
Please start with reading Whoopy-Cat's excellent PGII for Dummies first. 
This document is to be found at the Steve's clearing-house: hhttp://www.wargamer.com/pg2campaigns/steve/clearinghouse/pg2-mods_n_stuff.htm
(see at the Document section). This document will save you from a lot of aggravations and troubles that might arise 
when playing a user-made campaign for the first time. Please note that some of the instructions are 
not up-to-date (especially the part that deals with the datup, so use the instructions in this read-me 
instead in that area)..It's especially important that you read the section that deals with user-made maps
(see also 2.6) since this is the area where most new players make mistakes.

2.2 E-file requirements
This version is made for LatinGeneral's 4000/4000 e-file The latest official version at the time of
the conversion was beta 7.57, but later versions are now available. The latest versions of the 
LatinGenerals e-file are to be found at http://gilestiel.nerim.net/lg/

2.3 PGII version requirement
You will have to use the PG2 2.20 exe in order to play this campaign.

Please note that this campaign is NOT compatible with the standard PGII 1.02 version, and the game is likely to 
crash should you try playing with the standard PGII 1.02 version. 


2.4 Icon upgrades (dat-files)
In order to play the campaign you need to ensure yourself that you are playing with a fairly recent datfile,
otherwise you will risk having WRONG units in the games (minefield that moves, units from strange
countries etc..) It is highly recommendable that you use the latest datup, which is to be found at Steve's clearing-house
http://www.wargamer.com/pg2campaigns/steve/clearinghouse/pg2-mods_n_stuff.htm 
(see under Tools and Utilities, and look for "new Panzer2.dat by von Adler"

2.5 User-made maps (.map-files AND .shp-files)
Most of the troubles in playing a user-made campaign seem to arise from missing user-made maps. 
Please note that a map consists of two types of files (one *.map-file and a number of *.shp-files)
Please read the Dummies document written by Whoopy-Cat first and MAKE SURE you install 
BOTH the *.map file and the *.shp files in the correct folders. The *.map file should go in your
SCENARIO folder, while the *.shp files should go into a MAP folder (which you need to create
yourself if you haven't done that)

3. Naming of the files
All files in this version except this file have their original names, please don't mix files from this version with files from the BP version
or the AK version.

4. Further information about the conversion
4.1 Changes in scenarios
The BV limits in several scenarios have been adjusted (some have been tightened, some have been relaxed)
Some enemy towed ADs have been anchored to keep them from wandering off in aggressive scenarios.
Other than that no changes have been done to the scenarios.

4.2 Changes in prestige
The cap levels have been adjusted to reflect the different pricing in the LatinGenerals efile, 
and to allow a player to replace some original core losses (see also 6)

5. Files in this campaign.zip
This file campaign.zip contains the following files:
A number of files starting with nov42
The relevant .map files for the campaign (please note that you will need to download the corresponding
shp files yourself (se 2.6)
A documentation folder containing this text file and a scenario list file

To use, copy all files that begin with Nov42 into the Scenario Subfolder of your Panzer General 2 Folder. 

6. Important playing information
This is a campaign where you're supposed to be playing with a set core. In addition to the
core units already present on the map at the first scenario you should buy:

2 tanks (NEW requirement compared to the first version of the campaign)
3 towed AT with horse tpt 
2 towed Artillery with horse tpt 
2 recon units
2 towed AD with horse tpt 
3 reg Infanty w/o tpt 
3 Gebirgsjæger w/o tpt 

During the play you will  receive prestige that will allow you 
to upgrade these units and the original core units. Please note that an upgrade of all purchased
units will increase your core army value, and this will bring you closer to the so-called CAP,
that determines how much after-scenario prestige you will receive after a scenario. If you upgrade
'wrong' units early on you might risk receiving little or none after-scenario prestige, something
that will make it very difficult (if not impossible) for you to end the campaign, since you won't
have enough prestige for necessary upgrades. It is therefore advisable that you upgrade your
original core units (esp. the two tanks, the SPAT and your fighters) early on. It's also NOT 
advisable to buy any NEW additional units during the campaign, since this will also increase 
your core army value. However buying units to replace lost units is a different matter. If you 
play with the PG2 2.00 you will be able to buy experienced replacements to make up for 
any unit losses along the way, so you don't need to reload just to avoid a single unit loss..
The caps will also make it possible to replace some of the original core losses (with a value
of around 1000)...So you can replace one of the original tanks or two original infantry, 
but you can't replace more heavy losses to your original core... (If you for instance lose 
both your tanks early on, I advise you to restart the scenario instead of continuing to play)

This is a campaign with medium to hard difficulty level. Veterans should play this at 50-75,
Experienced players at 75-100, while newbies should play this campaign at 125 or higher.
Some scenarios don't give out much in-scenario prestige so there is not a huge difference
in playing levels, but you will need some prestige to refit units especially early on in the
campaign, and such prestige will be very difficult to obtain if you play at a lower prestige setting.

8. Playtesting, credits and contact information
This campaign has been playtested at 100% by myself after converting the campaing.

9, Version history
Version 3.0 was released as CC22 in 2004
Version 3.1 was released in December 2010 and contained a substantial rework of the campaign, where especially
the latter part of the campaign had been redesigned - and many of the scenarios had been moved to new maps


Credits are also due to Luiz Guzman for his wonderful suite, and Carl'Programmer' Ankerstjerne
for his Campaign editor.This work would have been a lot more arduous without these great toys

Many thanks to Maarten Folkers for letting me convert his enjoyable campaign. 
Any blame/criticism on this conversion should be addressed to myself and not to Maarten. 
Any problems/comments connected with this version can be addressed directly to myself at 
pzmaniac@yahoo.no or you can post your questions either at JP's panzers 
(The PG2 main section preferably) or at Builder's Paradise (the Scenario, campaign section). 
Please mark them ATT: PzManiac.

I hope you enjoy the campaign
Regards
Jan Hedström (aka PzManiac)
