Well done, Colonel, although some more speed would have been neccasary in real warfare. You have been promoted to General! You broke through, exploiting your mobility to move through the gap and finally you broke through the mountain passes and captured the objective! Our experiment with tanks and motorized infantry has been a great succes!
