DELAY AT ROVNO (1 July 1920)

No, comrade, you do have to worry about your food supply.  Take anything from the country as you go.  The people will help you and if they do not it is because they are still terrified of repressions by the capitalist pigs.  Now let us go back to our plan of operations, comrade. 


After our success at Kiev, the entire front in the Ukraine is moving west.  And still is! The Polish armies are far from defeated but they lack the power to stop our people's army for once and for all.  While our strategic goal will be Lwow, or Lemberg as the old imperialists from Germany would name it.  However the Poles seem to everything to stop them from liberating the people they are oppressing!

You are near Rovno.  As always you know what to do.  Capture all vital communication centers and push as far west as possible.  Most of all let nothing stop you!  Like a tornado you must use your mobility.  After all it is the symbol for cavalry!
