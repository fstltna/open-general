Estaires

Apr 9th, 1918

The Treaty of Brest-Litowsk has finally been signed, ending the war with Russia. That will allow thousands of German troops to head west. Even better, the opening of Russian resources to Germany, particularly those from the Ukraine, will alleviate the worst effects of the British blockade. So we'll have the opportunity to plan our next move thoroughly.

Many officers want to attack our enemies in France immediately, before they can react, but that's too risky. If anything goes wrong we'll go nowhere, just like in 1914. No, if we want to have real chances of winning we have to plan our final offensive down to the last detail. And that needs time and patience. I don't think we'll be ready before next year. 

That doesn't mean that we've been sitting on our hands at the Western front. We have made our defences stronger and deeper, knowing that France and Britain need  to regain the initiative and will attack very soon, before we can complete the deployment of our "Russian" divisions. They'll try to replicate the tactics devised at Cambrai, but at a much larger scale. The problem for them is that it's impossible to keep such a huge offenssive a secret, so this time they won't achieve surprise. We know that one of the places that has been chosen for a combined British-Portuguese assault is the sector that you're defending. After years of bombs and mines the once fertile fields have become a barren wasteland, one of the most horrible places on Earth. Soon you'll have to fight there. Be strong, General, you'll still have to fight many more battles before the war is over.

Victory conditions:
- After 12 turns you must hold 5 VHs for a BV, 4 VHs for a V or 2 VH for a TacV.
