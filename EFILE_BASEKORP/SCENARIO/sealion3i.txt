Historical Info:

After a long and successful raid against allied merchant ships "Admiral Graf Spee" fought with allied light cruisers "Exeter", "Ajax" and "Achilles" off Montevideo on 13 December 1939 . After the battle the germans decided to put into Montevideo for repairs while the allied ships took position in the Rio de la Plata estuary. With fake radio messages they conviced the germans that a large allied force will reach the scene soon. Hans Langsdorff, the commander of "Admiral Graf Spee" decided to scuttle the ship and save the lives of his crew. In the evening of 18 December 1939 the ship was destroyed by several explosions and burned for days in the shallow waters off Montevideo. Langsdorff commited suicide 2 days after and his crew got interned in Argentina until the war was over.
