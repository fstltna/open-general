General Kurt Student

Very good, Colonel! Despite hard resistance you fulfilled your mission. Without your brave efforts the operation would have failed. The commander of the 7th Air Division was killed in action. You are being promoted and will take over his command immediately. My congratulations, General Major! Your division will be transferred to Germany for some well earned rest.
