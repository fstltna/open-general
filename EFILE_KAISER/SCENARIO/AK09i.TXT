Épehy - September 17th, 1918

Liebe Anna,

I don't think that I will ever get used to life in the trenches. We lost Herbert yesterday. Earlier this week part of his cheek got eaten by a rat while he was sleeping. We put a bandage on it and he went to the doctor first thing in the morning. But it was too late. The rat's poison turned his face and neck all black and he died two days later. If only the time would come when I could see you again and take you in my arms, if only this misery would have an end. 

But it is not supposed to be. Rumour is that we will be relieved before the end of the month and will be sent back to where it all started for us: the Balkans.

Für immer dein,
Hugo

ORDERS: Oberst Bauernschmitt, our spring offensives have failed and we are back on the defence. The positions around Epéhy on the heights in front of the river Scheldt need to be held until the Hindenburg line behind us is in good enough shape to fall back to to resist Entente attacks.

OBJECTIVES: Hold all Victory Hexes for each of the 20 turns of the scenario. Move the reinforcement unit that appears in the last turn (turn 20).
