Herr General,

Near Belgorod the largest tank battle ever has been won by us! Four Russian tank corps have been completely destroyed. Though our Panzer corps were also quite battered and now incapable of doing very much we remain in possession of the battlefield, will be able to rebuild these,  and will tow away the loot. Though the papers will probably not mention it, the general staff has certainly noticed your contribution in defending our flank.

On the downside of the affair: The Soviets have breached the Donets line near Vorosilovgrad, it will probably not be long before we have to retreat to the Ostwall.
