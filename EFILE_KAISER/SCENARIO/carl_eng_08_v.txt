Once again you have proven to be the most brilliant general of the war. You have pushed the liberals back, although that will only delay them for a few months. Sooner or later they will launch their final offensive, and we will not have anything with which to cope with them.
But I have no doubt that, regardless of what our destiny will be, you will go down in history as one of the greatest European military officers of this century.
