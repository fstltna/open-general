SITUATION:

Comandante, our great victory at Alexandria enables us to proceed further east and gives us the chance to capture the northern end of the Suez Canal at Port Said. We also need to secure important Canal port and city of Ismailia, deep in the desert. After most of the enemies units got crushed at Alexandria, we expect only local resistance.

ORDERS: 

Take all VHs in 14/18/22 turns for a BV/V/TV.

NOTES:

You can buy up to 3 new units in this scenario.
