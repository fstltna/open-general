Jesus.  I can't believe you just won a war on the fucking Moon.  A+ work, Commander!  What's next, are we going to have to fight a war against mer-people?

Time to come home.  We need to track what those damn Reds have been doing in your absence.  The lunar corps can take care of covering up the battle and securing the site.

Carter out.
