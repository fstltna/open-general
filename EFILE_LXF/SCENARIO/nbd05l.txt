Well, we are a bit disappointed with this outcome. If you can't drive the Japanese off a lightly defended Island, how can we expect you to cope with their island bastions in the Pacific? I am afraid that you are suffering from combat fatigue. You are being sent back to the States for a good long rest, at least until this war is over.
