Washington D.C. and Surrounding Environs
August 10th, 1959

Commander!  ...Commander?

Commander, this is Carter.  You're not going to believe this.  

The eggheads have figured out what the machine does.  It's sent us through time and space...and if they've discovered how to read the data correctly, we're about five years in the future.  

They also say that this machine is capable of healing injuries and mending metal; and that it even comes equipped with a micro-factory that can build for us any equipment we need near-instanteously.  All assuming of course, that we have the raw materials to fuel it.  Still, some of the equipment blueprints I have on me might come in handy now.

I'm not positive, but the scenery looks familiar; I'd be willing to bet we're just a little ways outside D.C.

We need to investigate the nature of the situation.  Mobilize your men and secure the surrounding area.  In all likelihood, we're in safe hands, but there's no reason not to play it safe.

Carter out.
