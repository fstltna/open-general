18. OSLO (10 June 1945)

TO: Grossadmiral
SUBJECT: Last heroic stand!

---Germany has surrendered. In all of Europe, there is no German resistance anymore, except at Oslo, Festung Oslo. Here you are in command of all ground, air and naval forces. These troops do not think of surrendering: they will fight to their deaths. Their world is no more...

Your flotilla is locked in the Oslofjord and your Marine Corps is in Oslo. After the German surrender, Allied forces have swept into Norway to disarm our forces. This means, from all sides, Norwegian, British, American and Swedish forces are advancing on Oslo now.

We have no illusion of putting up a long fight. There is little ammunition, food and other supplies. But we will die here and go down like officers are supposed to! It was good knowing you, Grossadmiral. I could not have wished for a better person to serve under.---

NOTE: This scenario can only be lost. Goal is to play as many turns as possible. Losing core units is likely to happen...
