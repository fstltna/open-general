BATTLE OF SCIRE

March 2nd, 1936 (Scire Region, Tigray Province, Northern Ethiopia)

Ras Imru had known very little of what was going on at the main battlefields to his east. He had a marked tendency to obey orders and so he confined himself to sending out raiding parties behind the Italian lines and building up his defenses around the Coletza Heights.

Badoglio was confident of success not only because some reports put Ras Imru's total strenght at only 25,000 men, "in a poor moral and material state", but also because of the attitude of Dejaz Ayalew Birru who had shown in various ways that he was not adverse to submitting to Italian rules.

Nevertheless Ras Imru had been Italy's most dangerous opponent, the only Ethiopian commander who had attempted to maneuver, to cut communications, to threaten a counter-invasion, and to raise revolts in the Italian rear. Badoglio was taking no risks.

On 2 March, Maravigna's 2nd Corps advanced in an ENORMOUS LONG COLUMN that moved forward on both sides of the road.

The advance guard of the Gavinana and the artillery group was ambushed and almost surrounded by Ras Imru's men who had crept up over broken ground.

TE'RU AEDELE (Good Luck!)
