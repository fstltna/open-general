Dear Friend,
I have only time for a short letter.... The recent days saw only minor skirmishes. We don't know what is going on, and it seems our maneuvers were unsuccessful... 
Now we are on our way to Manasas Junction and were marching all day long....
I have only few minutes because we can hear some battle noise from far ahead of us. Will it be a minor skirmish again?


ORDERS:
The Confederates are attacking the II corps but it seems they are not aware your corps is close behind. Repell the attack and continue your way to Manassas Junction. Reports from our scouts suggest that the enemy will attack from the north only.

Retreat 30 core and/or auxilliary units. (There is a total of 22 auxilliary units + some reinforements)


ADVICE FROM YOUR OLDEST SERGEANT:
Sir, may I suggest to stay near the railroad and keep the troops together?
