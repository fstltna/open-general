Valga
February 2, 1919

Brigaadikindral, victory at Narva has brought stability to the whole eastern frontier... for the moment.  Using a rapidly-growing railroad capability, we have been able to transfer your battle-hardened troops to the southern sector of fighting.  The situation here has been difficult for the 2nd and 3rd regiments, the Kuperjanow Brigade, and the Pohjan Poikain Finnish regiment.  With rapid Bolshevik political and military gains in neighboring Latvia, the Red Army has found an ally among many of them:  enough for a full standing division and another in formation!  Defensively, Valga is an important railroad hub, and its capture will tear a large gap in the Soviet Latvian Army's northern flank.

The Red Latvians have fortified within the city.  They are keeping 2 regiments in reserve, and intelligence warns of an unknown number of armored trains present.  On both sides of the Latvians are regular Soviet divisions.  The 85th regiment of the 10th, has partially deserted.  We have no way of knowing the full extent of the Latvians' reinforcements, so expect the worst after you capture Valga...
