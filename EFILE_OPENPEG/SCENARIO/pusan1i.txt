Pusan, South Korea
It has been three long years since our declaration of war. In that time we have seen many disasters, Irkutsk, Volgograd, and Southeast Asia. Now, after a fierce battle down the Korean Peninsula, we have finally stopped the Chinese and their North Korean allies outside the Korean city of Pusan. You have been selected to strike the blow that will liberate Asia from the Chinese Red Banner.

You are to strike from the port city of Pusan, and take the cities of Masan, Ulsan, and Miryang, as a stepping stone to freeing the South Korean capital of Seoul. What is left of the South Korean Army is there to provide assistance. Good Luck.
