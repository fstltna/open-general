Orders:

Our Advance got stuck at the German Gustave Line. You and your men will carry out a seaborne landing near Anzio while the 5th Army will launch an attack in the Cassino area.

After out landing in the Anzio area the germans might rush troops to fight our beachhead, but that will weaken ther positions at the Gustav Line. In the first phase of the landings we don't expect much resistance. But reports indicate strong Luftwaffe forces and even submarines in this area.

You Orders are to hold the beachhead and resist any german attack.

Hold 6 Victory Hex for a Brilliant Victory, 4 VH for a Victory and 2 VH for a tactical Victory.
