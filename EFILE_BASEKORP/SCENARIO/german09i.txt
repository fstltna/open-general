Second part of the "Defending the Reich" minicampaign.

With the invasion of Sicily, Allied forces got a footing on European threshold, soon to be followed with major landing in Italy proper.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

You are garrisoned in the small Sicilian town not far away from the seashore. Since the early morning you hear the cannonade of naval guns, and now your town, a former Greek colony of the Ancient times, is assaulted by daring Canadian and British onslaught.

The local militiamen hold their positions. There's also a regiment of Italian paratroopers undergoing the mountain training and they are surrounded in their garrison. Our combined airforce is on par with the enemy.

The opposing forces are strong, well equipped, highly motivated, and experienced. We face a tank brigade and a full infantry division, including the medium artillery and lots of other supporting elements.

There are some of our men who were assigned a guarding duty in the vicinity of southern river crossing. Don't let them alone, they need every possible backup, especially the mighty 88's, lest they fall prey to the enemy armour.

Tip: Infantry is best suited for street-to-street fights... and the local men know their streets.
