Commander, the Japanese  really handed us a brutal thumping. It will be a long 
time before we will consider attacking Lae again. Perhaps you are not quite 
ready for the New Guinea Theater just yet. Since we can't spare any combat 
officer at this time, we will have to give you a new assignment.  The president 
has suggested you take a position as liason officer to the Dominican Republic, 
but we have a better idea. We have a little mission for you far out in the Pacific 
. . . .
