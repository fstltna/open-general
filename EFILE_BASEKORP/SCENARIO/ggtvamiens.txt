Herr General OKW have expressed doubts about your abilities in the new type of warfare. Make haste to your next mission! 

On the evening of May 19th Guderian was given complete freedom of action and decided that he would take not only Amiens but Abbeville also the next day. They were to throw bridgeheads across the River Somme and await the enemy coming down from the north. By 9am 1st Panzer with Guderian at the front had captured Amiens. The Corps then pushed on along the north bank of the river, when 2nd Panzer arrived at Abbeville in the afternoon they were out of fuel and the tanks were left in front of the town while Riflemen, Sappers and Artillerymen took the objective. A British Artillery battery was captured on a parade ground armed only with blanks as no-one expected the Germans to arrive so quickly. An hour after the capture of Abbeville a battalion from 2nd Panzer commanded by Major Spitta reached the Channel coast at Noyelles and the great nation of France was severed in two.
