August 25, 1943

After the annihilation of the 2nd Army, only a few occupation troops remained in Russia. The German offensive failed at Kursk, we should retreat to the area of the Pripyaty marshes, the border between Ukraine and Belorussia. We have to face strong partisan activity here. The Polish partisans are arch enemies of the Germans, but we have an unofficial cease-fire with them. Moreover, they hate Bolsheviks more than us, and inform us of any Red activity they detect. Your task is to secure Kovel, which is an important junction on the rail line running from Kiev to Warsaw.

NOTE: You have 11 DHs. Kill 7 "must survive" partisans! 

RULES: Old spotting rules represent the help of the Polish resistance. Supply lines are used by Wehrmacht, the High Command cannot send you reinforcement (cannot purchase new units).
