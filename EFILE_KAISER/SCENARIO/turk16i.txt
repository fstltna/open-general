Transjordan Attack - April 30th, 1918

After the fall of Jerusalem, we were able to stop the British forces in the Valley of the Jordan. The German generals decided to dig us in, in a "Western Front" style, with big trench-systems, MG-nests and entrenchend artillery. Theorically, that would force the British to attack on free ground against our defence system, suffering heavy losses.

Knowing that, the High Command of the Egyptian Expeditionary Forces decided to try a different strategy. They concentrated the British attacks at one point: at the north of the Dead Sea. They were successful, and they managed to break trough our lines. Now, all their cavalry units, some infantry and the Imperial Camel Corps of the EEF stand deep behind our lines. They've just reached El Salt.

General, you and your brave men must destroy the invaders.... Close the gap and throw them back again to the other shore of the Jordan.
The Germans will send us strong air support, but there will be many hostile airplanes, too.....
