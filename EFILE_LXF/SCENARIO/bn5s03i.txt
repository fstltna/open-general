
HIT & RUN - 28 APR 1942

HQ Soviet Partisans, Lithuania
CO General Karotamm

Comrade, its time to strike the invaders where it hurts. You'll attack a weak defended German supply depot and raise the Red Banner on its ruins! The Germans did not expect large partisan forces in this area and need some time to react. Take advantage of surprise, but be fast! It's a dangerous mission, speed is everything here!

Order: Reach the EH (red-border hex) and retreat 3 units.
