Battle of the lake Khasanen (the Zhanggufeng Incident)

A row of border crossings and provocations at the russian-japanese border near Vladivostok has caused hostilities. The russians crossed the border and were attacked by the 19th japanese division.

This scenario contains the first 14 days, where the japanese were attacking. At august the 11th the russians counterattacked with two divisions and a tank brigade with heavy artillery support. This forced the japanese back and they agreed to a armistice with the old borders.
