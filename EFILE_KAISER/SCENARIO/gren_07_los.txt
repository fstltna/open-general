Diamond Hill was one of the last true battles of the war. Our división remained in the area surrounding Pretoria for nearly a month, and later we were again given secondary tasks, pursuing small Boer commandos.

In September I discovered the inhuman conditions that the Boer civilians had to endure in our concentration camps, where they were dying of starvation and disease by the hundreds. I tried to talk to General Kitchener about the matter, but he wouldn't listen to me. His refusal to deal with this terrible problem was the final blow to my poor health, and some days later I fell victim to typhoid fever. I was sent to a hospital in Cape Town, where I spent ten days between life and death. Although I survived, my convalescence was long, but at least I received the best of surprises when Evelyn and Christine came by my side to take care of me. 

I eventually recovered my strength, but the High Command decided that the war was over for me. I was sent back to England, where we arrived in July 1900. Miss Hobhouse had already sent the Government her well-known report on the concentration camps in South Africa, the British public was well aware of the situation, and the Fawcett Commision was being created to investigate Hobhouse's claims. So I decided to remain silent about what I knew. Nothing that I could have said would have provided any additional help to those poor people, and it would have contributed to sully the reputation of my beloved Army. 

However, my South African experiences had affected me deeply. They were the start of a spiritual journey that would end with my conversion in 1904, following the path that Evelyn had taken ten years before. Some friends said that it would be the end of my career, but they were wrong. The Relief Act was already old when I was born, and in the XX century these kind of decisions were not scandals any more. In 1909 I was finally appointed as a Major-General.
