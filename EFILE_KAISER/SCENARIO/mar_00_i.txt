1909 Crisis at Melilla

July, 12th, 1909

Message from General Marina Vega's HQ:

General, starting in 1908 some Riffian "kabilas" near Melilla have been revolting.  They have built up their irregular army by purchasing foreign weapons, and now they have attacked the Spanish workers in the area.  Some tribal leaders are claiming a holy war against Spain and the Riffian harkas (the Moroccan irregular forces) have put Melilla in great danger. 

Your troops will have to stop the Moroccans at the gates of Melilla and save Spain's honor and its men.  You can expect reinforcements from Spain.  First save Melilla and the unarmed colonists, then counterattack and crush the rebel Riffians.


Victory conditions: Take all VHs.
Three "colonos" (Spanish civilians) units must survive.
