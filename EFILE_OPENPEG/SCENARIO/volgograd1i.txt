Volgograd, Russia
You must avenge a past defeat. It was at Volgograd that a defeated Russian nation sued for peace. It is to be here that we launch the re-conquest of Siberia and the Russian Far East.  A humiliated Russia, ready for vengeance, needs only a spark of hope to rejoin the effort to free Asia.

Your mission is to recapture the city of Volgograd, destroying all Chinese forces in the area. This city is significant not only for its industrial infrastructure and strategic location, but for what it symbolizes to the world: freedom from Chinese oppression. Again one more critical battle must be fought in its streets. The free nations of the world are watching this battle. Failure is not an option.
