THE BENGHAZI HANDICAP April 1941 - TV

Most of the 2nd Armored division and the 3rd Motorized Indian Brigade were destroyed or surrendered. But a lot of the corps troops and the 9th Australian Division escaped. Reconnaisance reports indicate that some of these troops are at Tobruk and that others are fleeing further East. 

This is no time to rest. Move your troops East and capture Tobruk.

Note: Only 5 ground units can be deployed in the next scenario.
