Operation Marita April1941 TV
 
We heared these messages were received on the radio:
During the night the 8th Panzer Division drove into Belgrade, occupied the center of the city, and hoisted the Swastika flag.
With General von Kleist at the head, the 11th Panzer Division has been rolling into the capital since 0632.
Most important is Belgrade is captured, but we hoped your SS forces would be able to accomplish this task on their own, without the help from 2 Panzer divisions.
