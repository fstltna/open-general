Brief to Anzac Commander.

Intelligence tells us that the Turks are about to launch a massive offensive with the aim of driving us back into the sea!! It is imperitive that you hold all your positions!! Good Luck. (There is only 2 possible outcomes:- Brilliant Victory for holding your 3 Vic Hexs OR Loss for not holding them)
