You surpassed my wildest dreams, Kapteeni!  
The 139th Rifle Division was wiped out. Now we can really think about expanding our actions in this sector.
I think it became clear why the Soviets on our flank didn't advanced further. Our sausages and soup tasted too good. Ha Ha.  
Your troops must remain on the alert. Decisive battles may happen over the next few days.
