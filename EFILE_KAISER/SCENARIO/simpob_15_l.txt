Those were the last lines that my beloved uncle wrote before engaging in battle, one last time, with the Red Army. As you already know, he was killed in that action, so he didn't live to see the Bolshevik Revolution defeated and Russia freed.

However, his sacrifice hasn't been forgotten, and today his relatives have joined here, in Samara, to pay tribute to this true Russian hero. Uncle, you have made our lives possible. We owe you everything, and we want you to be sure that we'll remember you until the day we die. Za pobedu, hura!!!
