12. MOSIGETTA (1 February 1945)

On 23 January 7th Brigade has taken over operations in southern Bougainville from 29th Brigade. Our advance will now not only be at the coastal area but also inland using the mountain trails.

Inland, your forces must, using the mountain trail to get there, first capture Kupon, and next advance to and conquer the town of Mosigetta. Mosigetta is an important communication center through which the Japanese are using to maintain communication with various garden areas in the west. Little resistance is expected according to 2/8 Commando Squadron's reports.

At the coast you must advance to a crossroads known as Anderson's Junction. On the coastal track, opposition is feared to be heavy and a frontal attack will cost us too much time and casualties. Therefore you are ordered to embark a company from Motopena and land at behind the Japanese positions near the settlement of Toko, close to Anderson's Junction. Perform as much damage to the enemy's rear and the advance by coast will become much easier. Headquarters hopes to cut off some Japanese troops as well. Good luck, General!
