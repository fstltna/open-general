"Is this the Fuhress,can You hear Me? I can barely hear You.Yes this is Savannah.We captured it finally.It was costly though.Yes the Air Korps payed a heavy price too,We got planes littered all over the area.Nah the Dam Soviet Big Guns are still firing that's why I can barely hear.We're setting up Our own and moving some Stu's to fire across the Volga.I'm sending some dingey's across with Assault Fraus.We're also building a bridge to get a few Tigers over there,let's see the Guns do something then when they are on top of the Soviet Bastards.They will be silenced,but still going to cost Us.The Air Korps is pounding the Forces trying to encircle Us,they finally do have Air-Superiority in this area anyway.Those Dam Hexxens layed waste when they arrived,doubt if We could of won this battle without their involvement.Frau Stercghassman get a fleet of those flying this War will be over a lot faster.Why,they could win the War.You mean those loons the 'Hortens design is better,that's something I got to see.Well I'm moving back My HQ for the moment,better safe then sorry.A few Days I guess the Eradication squads will arrive,they really got their job cut out for here.Must be 200,000 civilians around and We took about 90,000 soldiers prisoner.We're herding them towards the outskirts so We can get things in order.Yes I know My Fuhress,a Great Moment in Our time.We have them now".
