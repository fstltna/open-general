Battle of El Hani and Bu Meliana - Tactical Victory

Congratulations. Although the Italian Navy makes it impossible for us to hold on to our gains, we gave the Italians a bloody nose and took away their hopes of an easy conquest of Trablusgarp. Our victory has reached foreign newspapers. Now it is up to the diplomats to make an end to this war.

Historical outcome
The Italians were dealt a crushing defeat by the more maneuverable Ottoman forces. The 11th Bersaglieri Regiment effectively seized as a fighting force and the Italians had to send many more troops to Tripoli. It took them many more weeks and troops to quell the civil unrest and to restore the perimeter around the city. Thousands of civilians got publicly executed or displaced. Houses were burned down and cattle was confiscated.
