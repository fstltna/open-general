Operation White Sword - Gatchina
October 14, 1919

Kindralleitnant, stretched to its limits, our offensive is drowning in the blood of its soldiers.  Wave after wave of Bolshevik troops is thrown at our valiant warriors.  Not only Petrograd, even Gatchina seem to be beyond the limits of the Northwestern Army.

Trotsky has formed the Udarnaya (Shock) Group to counter-attack our positions at Vyritsa.  You must maintain cohesion of the front, Kindralleitnant!
