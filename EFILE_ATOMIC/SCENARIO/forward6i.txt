Pocket of Brjansk
The situation at the Brjansker front is very grave. The XXIV. Motorized Army Corps could brake through your lines south of Brjansk. It may be expected that they will turn northwards and try to encircle your troops. Try to evacuate your troops slowly but do not miss to defend Brjansk and your other targets.
Your troops:
The 50. Army is reported to you. Altogether 50 troops will help you. They are still inexperienced, but they should be strong enough to slow the German advance a little bit. 
Enemy troops:
The Germans have many tank divisions, infantry divisions and bomber squadrons. You should calculate with heavy attacks from the west and the south. The strongest German troops are deployed in the southwest.
