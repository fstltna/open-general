1939-45 FRENCH CAMPAIGN

In September 1939 war breaks out in Europe. Germany faces three enemies: Poland, Great Britain and France. The French forces fought many battles before they surrendered in June 1940. In 1939 they will skirmish into Germany but retreat when the Polish case is lost. Then, in May 1940 Germany attacks on a huge front. The Allied armies, most of them being French, resist the enemy. However the German Army proved to be superior. And in June 1940 France resists but will have to surrender. Also in June 1940 Italy attacks France. You will command French forces in almost all battles where French forces fought in France, Belgium and Holland during 1939 and 1940! If you escape the fall of France you move to North Africa where you join the Free French; you then participate in battles in Libya, Tunisia, Italy and come back to France in 1944!

This campaign is a union of two classic campaigns - BATTLE OF FRANCE, 1939-1940 by Dennis Felling and FRENCH CAMPAIGN, 1940-45 by Steve Brown!
