Well, our counteroffensive has been a failure after all. It doesn't matter. The Germans have just taken Riga, in the Baltic. I wouldn't be surprised if, in the following months, Russia fell into chaos and the Bolsheviks took power. In the short term that would be good for us. The war at the Eastern front would be over, and we could send more troops to the west, where we need them desperately.

But, right now, we need to talk, General. The future of the Empire is at stake. We need commanders who don't make serious mistakes. Your performance at Marasesti has been far from optimal. Given your service record, you'll be assigned to a prestigious position in Wien. Well paid, but far from the front line. I'm afraid that those days are over for you.
