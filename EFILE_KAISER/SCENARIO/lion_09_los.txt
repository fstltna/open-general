I couldn't repel the first wave of Italian invaders, but with the help of reinforcements from Shewa and Harar we could finally stop the enemy offensive, at least for a while.

I was saddened when I saw how many Tigrayans were serving in the Italian colonial army. One of Menelik's aims had always been to limit the political and military power of Tigray, so that their inhabitants could never be a challenge for his authority. 

The consequence of this great mistake was now clear: detached from the Ethiopian Empire, now the majority of the Eritrean Tigrayans viewed themselves as a different nation. If they ever got rid of the Italians, they would fight for an independent Eritrea, but they didn't wish to rejoin their Ethiopian brethren.
