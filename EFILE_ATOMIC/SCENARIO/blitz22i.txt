General, as you know the Kursk Salient poses a serious threat to us. To reduce this salient and restore the integrity of our line, we will attack from the north and south, pocket, and then crush the enemy trapped inside. You and your command will lead the southern thrust of our offensive. You must penetrate as far as the town of Prokhorovka. Good Luck.
