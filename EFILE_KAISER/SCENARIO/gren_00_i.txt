First blood: the Zulu war

June 3rd, 1879

In 1878, not long after my 22nd birthday, I was finally commissioned as second lieutenant. Less than a month after I had joined my regiment we were ordered to travel to Southern Africa, where a war had erupted against the local Zulu tribes. Amazingly, those native warriors had managed to defeat two of our battalions at Isandlwana in January 1879, and Lord Chelmsford, the British commander, had been forced to ask for reinforcements.

However, the journey was long, so when we arrived our troops had already retaken the initiative. I couldn't take part in any of the big battles of this peculiar war, but at least I had my first real combat experience.

Despite all the years that have passed, I still remember it as if it was yesterday; our scouts had spotted a small enemy impi (armed force) raiding a fertile valley. My battalion was sent to put an end to that menace and destroy the Zulu camp.
