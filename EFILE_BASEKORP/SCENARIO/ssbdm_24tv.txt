SS Air Fuhress Inga Kohler Stercghassmann finally got Her chance to speak in the meeting of the War Cabinet." I told You all along Ilse that if You did not let Me build up the Bomber Fleets this would happen.Stalin has too many People and He will use every last one to save Russia.He still has Forces in Siberia He hasn't even tapped into yet.He's got Factories going up as I speak.Attrition is on His side,It will always be,We have to make sure it is not too lopsided in His favor.You can kill all You want on the Fronts but this War will be Won 100's of kilometers behind the Fronts.If We don't have 500 Heavy Bombers flying to cities obliterating eveything underneath them We cannot Win this War.And that has to start soon before Stalin goes underground,then even 500 bombers will not be enough.My sending 50 or a 100 is a joke.Yes We destroy stuff and the Soviets build it back over night.Yes We destroy a 100 tanks and the next day a 150 arrive to take their place.Only through total Destruction of Areas can We hope to acheive Victory.I need  400 Heavy bombers in 3 Months to get to those oilfields East of Stalingrad. I only have 286 at the moment and half are wore Out".Ilse was pissed,talked to in this tone.Everyone was thinking any second Her Luger would be pulled,Inga would be dead.Ilse stood up "Okay Frau Stercghassmann,You will have those Bombers".
