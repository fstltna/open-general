
GROZNY - 22 APR 1942

South of Grozny, Caucasus

Since the beginning of year the Japanese could achieve grandiose successes against the Allies in Southeast Asia and Pacific. The Philippines, Dutch East Indies, Malaya, Burma and Singapore were conquered in recent months and the Japanese Kwantung Army in the Far East has opened the awaited second front against the Soviets.

But also our Spring Offensive in South Russia and the Caucasus makes good progress - a Soviet tank corps is threatened with encirclement near Grozny. The enemy, however, has recognized the danger and tried to break away in northeast direction to escape destruction. Your order is to cut off the path of the enemy forces, prevent their escape and crush the trapped divisions together with the forces moving up from the West! 

GOAL: Take all VH's and prevent the escape of more than 4 enemy ground units via Exit Point!

NOTE: All axis nations auxiliaries are under your command.

Main reinforcements:
4th turn - southwest, Romanian 4th Mountain-Division
7th turn - northwest, Brigade-size combat group
8th turn - west, Regiment-size combat group
