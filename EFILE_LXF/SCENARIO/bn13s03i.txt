
LAON - 17 MAY 1940

The strategic situation is critical. The German Armies are rumbling into the Netherlands and Belgium and are being faced with our Armies. However in the center of the front in the West the Germans have crossed the Meuse River in force. A giant gap of 80 km from Dinant to Sedan exists. As we speak, the enemy is pouring in troops. 

We are doing everything we can to plug the gap but the speed of the German armoured troops is impressive. They keep on advancing before we are able to entrench and face the enemy.

Your troops are located south of the German armoured trust into northern France near Reims. You have been ordered to attack the German Panzer Divisions in their flank and create havoc in the Laon vicinity. Beware that the Germans are west of you but also still coming in from the east. And there is always the superior Luftwaffe. However you must succeed and buy time. Vive la France!

GOAL: Take all VH's!
