Laos Counteroffensive


February, 1971

Welcome back to the front commander. Once again we need you to re-start the offensive against the enemy. The southern capitalist forces have invaded Laos.  They are trying to cut our supply lines in that country's jungle. By the way Hanoi wants to expunge the south Vietnamese troops from there to preserve our supply lines in Laos.  They also want to show our Laotian allies we can defeat their invaders. Your task is to free the entire Ye Pon river valley from the enemy.

Remember, for the past year we have been receiving a large surplus of weapons from our comrade allies from China and the USSR. You may now re-equip your units with new equipment.
