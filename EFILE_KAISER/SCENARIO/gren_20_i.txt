Arras

March 24th, 1918

The war was a terrible burden for Britain, but it was still worse for Germany. It had taken away most of our enemies' reserves, and without any replacements for their lost men and equipment, their army would die out before the end of the year. Their only chance was a final, decisive blow with everything they had left, so that they could outflank our army and defeat us. After acheiving that, they thought that France would ask for an armistice, and I believe that they were right.

So in the spring of 1918 Germany launched a most vicious attack. They used all the knowledge thay had acquired on trench warfare during these years, and I must confess that, initially, the execution of their plan was close to perfection. They advanced deeply behind our lines, disrupting our communications and menacing Arras and Amiens. Just as it had happened at Cambrai, some of our units were on the verge of panic, and if we did not stop the German advance inmediately, there was a real danger of being trapped between our enemies and the sea. Again, it was my duty to hold our lines and save my country from a most embarrasing defeat.
