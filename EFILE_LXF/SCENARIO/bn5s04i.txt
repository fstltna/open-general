
RESCUE MISSION - 12 SEP 1943

HQ Soviet Partisans, Estonia
CO General Karotamm

A plane loaded with a important U.S. politician, on his way to Moscow, was forced to make an emergency landing in our area. This gentleman must be saved, and Moscow has developed an daring plan, just right for you!
A British submarine, ready to take our guest is waiting off the coast. You must carry the VIP by air or by sea to the rendezvous-point, a little island lying off the coast.
But first you have to conquer the port or airfield of Kuressaare in a coup. Split you force in two groups. With the southern group perform a mock attack against the German positions, while the second group together with the VIP, past the busy Germans in the north and perform an fast attack against Kuressaare. Capture a plane or a vessel and carry this sporty Cowboy to the rendezvous-point. Good luck, Comrade!

Order: Reach the EH (red-border hex) and retreat the VIP MSU unit.
