
PLAYER CHOICE SCENARIO

After your fighting in the battle in May, the frontline has been stabilized at the Somme and Aisne Rivers, onto the Maginot Line. Soon the fighting will start again! You may choose where to be deployed and fight the Germans in the second phase of the Battle for France.

You can choose for 10th Army under General Altmeyer which deployed at the western end of the Weygand Line at the Somme River in the vicinity of Amiens and Abbeville. Or you can choose for the 5th Army under General Bourret which is deployed in the Saar region in Lorraine at the Maginot Line. Both assignments will offer action once the war regains its active nature.

THE EASTERN PATHS CONTAINS THE NEXT BATTLES: MARHANGE AND ALTKIRCH.

THE WESTERN PATH CONTAINS THE NEXT BATTLES: AMIENS III AND ST. VALERY-EN-CAUX.

AFTER EITHER ALTKIRCH OR ST. VALERY-EN-CAUX BOTH PATHS WILL JOIN AGAIN. BOTH PATHS ARE EQUAL IN DIFFICULTY AND FUN.
