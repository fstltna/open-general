Marienburg - Aluksne
February 10, 1919

Brigaadikindral, Kolonel Kalm of the Finnish Pohjan Poikain regiment has presented the following plan to you in confidence:  he wishes to continue to pursue the retreating Soviet forces into Latvia proper.  With the political sitation still unstable in Latvia (there had been an official announcement of the formation of a Bolshevik Latvian government), you are certain that such a move will not be approved by the Estonian military command.  However, such a daring move will deal a severe tactical and strategic blow to the Red Army in this region.

Accepting Kalm's plan, you will have neither the time nor the HQ support to outfit your troops properly for the attack:  only 9 battalions (including a maximum of 4 Soomusrong units) can participate.  Furthermore, this is a hunt-and-destroy mission.  You must eliminate all Soviet forces in the region.
