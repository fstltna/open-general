General, this was nothing less than a disaster! The Turkish machine-guns mowed down our men. Whole Battalions have been wiped out. This failure has broken the fighting spirit of our brave men. There are hardly enough men left to hold our positions, let alone for another attack. The government is considering an evacuation. There are a lot of people back home who would like to see you court-martialed for this unique example of military incompetence. You are relieved of your command, Sir!

HISTORICAL OUTCOME:
Following an extended preliminary bombardment, but yet again advancing in broad daylight,  the Allies mades some progress, but a spirited Turkish counter-attack drove the French from the trenches they had gained. The Royal Naval Division was caught in enfilade fire from the right where the French advance had failed and was forced to retreat, causing the whole attack to crumble. By the end of the battle the new front line was a mere 200 to 250 yards in front of the start line, passing through a patch of vines that earned the area the name of 'The Vineyard'. The British alone lost 4,000 casualties in this costly failure.
