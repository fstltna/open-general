D-Day II

Gentlemen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee!

D-Day has come and first of our troops have landed in Normandy.
The weather is not really good, but good enough for our air forces to smash the enemy's strongholds.

While our British troops are doing well at 'Sword', 'Juno', and 'Gold', our U.S. 1st Infantry Division has run into trouble at 'Omaha'. There is a new German division we did not know about which is slaughtering our men. Maybe we need some assistance by the Royal Navy and the R.A.F. there.

However, we must not neglect the other landing zones! Caen has to be conquered within 2 days, and the Germans are said to prepare counter-attacks by one or more Panzer divisions.

Needless to say that we must hold all landing zones! If we lose those footholds, 'Overlord' will fail and we won't have no more chance to win the war!

Good day, General!

As I had always supposed, the enemy has landed in Normandy!
And no doubt, this is the one and only invasion!

Unfortunately, the Wehrmacht High Command and some of my colleagues in France do not believe that and refuse to dispatch our Panzer divisions. So the only way to throw the enemy back into the sea is this:

1. The 352nd I.D. must hold their sector at any rate to prevent an American break-through into the hinterland. We have absolutely no reserves in the west!

2. In the east, near Caen, the 21st Panzer division is ready for combat.
However, it is probably too weak. So I authorize you to collect a strong combat group of any units gradually arriving south of Caen.
In order to prevent blocked roads, select only the best units - particularly much Flak; you will need it!
And do not listen to local generals or even higher ranked commanders which may tell you to wait, to split up these units etc.

Just throw the Allies back into the sea!
If you succeed the paratroopers in the hinterland will be isolated and can easily be defeated later.

Good luck, Herr General!
