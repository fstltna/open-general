Citoyen General, this victory is worthy of great praise! You have liberated our capital in style. Your service for our country will remain unforgotten. The imperials tried to bombard the young city, Pest, but the heroism of the dismounted hussars has saved the eastern bank of the Danube. I hope this war has now come to a glorious end.

NOTE: You have got notable prestige award last time. Spend it carefully. 22-23 core units should be enough to win the campaign. The rest of the campaign consists of defensive scenarios, the prestige awards are limited, and even the cap will decrease.
