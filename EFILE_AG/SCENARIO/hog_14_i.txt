50 B.C. : ROMA! 

The heart of the enemy ...... Rome!
We should encircle the city and prepare for a relief attack from the southeast; because our spies have reported the landing of enemy veteran forces from Greece .....

But even in the Heart of Rome, our enslaved tribe brothers have taken up arms....!

[The Supreme druid approaches towards you:] 
Latest by now we should get a hold on Etruscan siege equipment.
..... May the gods be with you ....
