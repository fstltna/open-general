When we finally stopped to rest and regroup, the First and the Fith Soviet Armies had been virtually destroyed. In the north, the Siberians had met moderate success, too. However, we were exhausted, and the heavy rains had turned the roads into streams of mud. We couldn't  continue our race to the Volga. 

Besides, in the south, the cossacks, outnumbered, without adequate equipment, and isolated from the rest of our army, hadn't been able to take Orenburg. From that stronghold the Soviets now threatened our left flank. Unable to advance, we relized that our enemies would counterattack very soon. We knew that we'd have to resist, or we'd be forced to retreat to Siberia, this time permanently.
