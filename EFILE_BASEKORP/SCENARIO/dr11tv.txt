Kiev encirclement - Konotop September1941 TV

600,000 Bolsjeviks are trapped in the Kiev pocket, but we lost valuable time. Send your troops back North for the final assault on Moscow. And don't give me any excuses, I know the raspoetitsa - the dreaded Fall rains - have set in. This will disrupt mobility but we do need to reach Moscow before the winter.
