Ah! Welcome, Commander! Let me brief you on the tactical situation: Russia is pushing Allied troops into western Germany. As our troops are bottled up in this region, you will lead advance elements of a covert invasion force into Poland.Take the surrounding area and eliminate Soviet resistance. Some bombers are on the way for support. Good luck!
