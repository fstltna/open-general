A DANCE WITH THE QUEEN December12 1940

You are now in command of the complete 63rd Cyrene Division that is stationed in Camp Sofafi. Main units in the division are the 157 and 158 infantry regiments and the 45th artillery regiment.

With our fleet crippled by an aerial torpedo attack at Taranto and vital reinforcements and supplies siphoned off to the Greek campaign, there is little more that we can do than sit and wait in our ring of fortresses near Sidi Barrani. 

In the last 3 days, the British 7th Armoured Division and the Indian 4th Division have captured all but our Sofafi and Rabia camps. We have lost the 2 Libica Divisions, the Maletti Group, the fourth Camicie Nere Division and the 64th Catanzaro division.

Player notes: 
- Four camps in your hands at the end of the scenario will give you a BV, three a V, two a TV and one or zero will result in a loss.
- Please do not reassign (sell) the defensive units that you get. Deploy them on the map.
