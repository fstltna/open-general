52 B.C. : Alesia

Vercingetorix is a brilliant commander-in-chief: instead of leading us into grueling open field battles, whose outcome would be rather uncertain, and which would weaken us substantially; We destroy the Roman supply routes and burn all the grain that we can not bring to safety ....

The supply shortage has already considerably weakened the Romans .... and in this situation Caesar comes with an unexpected move:
He is risking everything, and has pulled together all his legions around the strong fortress Alesia .

[The Supreme druid approaches towards you:] 
.... these crazy Romans have actually built a pallisade towards the city, and a pallisade towards our relief army .....!
Vercingetorix couldn`t manage to escape from Alesia .... He gave the supreme command over the entire Gallic relief army to you!

Young Prince ...! This is a great honor!
If Vercingetorix gives the sign, he attacks with his men from inside; we must attack the Roman fortifications frontally With all our warriors from outside ...!

This will be the hardest struggle we have ever had to make .... if we win here and destroy a large part of the Roman troops, we will win back all Gaul in one move!
Then even the way to Rome is open to us ....

In the name of all our gods, let us swear a holy oath:
Freedom or death!

May the gods be with us ....
