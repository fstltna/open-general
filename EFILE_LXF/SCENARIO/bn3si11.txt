
SUI HSIEN FRONT
27 Nov 1940

Part of Operations in Central Hupei
Late November - Early December 1940

Subsequent to the Battle of Tsao-Yi in the summer of 1940, though the Japanese occupied Ichang and Shashih, Chinese forces controlled the area east and west of the Hsiang River. Hence, the Japanese forces in Ichang and Shashih were greatly threatened on the flanks, finding themselves in a most awkward situation. To rid it self of this thorn, the Japanese launched a series of attacks against the Chinese in late November, 1940.
