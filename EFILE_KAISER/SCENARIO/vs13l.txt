Antwerp - The second exit - September 9th 1914 - L

The Belgian Army succeeded in severing communications with our army at the Marne and drew substantial forces away from that army. Our advance on Paris has failed. The Allies won the battle of the Marne and our army had to retreat to the Aisne. 

Only the arrival of more German divisions forced the Belgian Army to retreat to their starting positions around Antwerp. With hopes of a capture of Paris gone and your 6.Reserve Division reunited with 5.Reserve Division, it is time to deal with Antwerp.
