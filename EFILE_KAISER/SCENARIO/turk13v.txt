Supporting the allies: Galicia  - victory

A fine victory, General. The Russians won't dare to threaten our sector for a long time. The winter will be cold, but at least it will be calm, too.

Historical outcome
The Russian attacks were finally repulsed, but the Ottomans paid a very high price for their victory.  In Galicia, during 1916 and 1917, the Turkish XV Army Corps suffered nearly 25,000 casualties, and the Russians took 10,000 Turkish prisoners of war. Finally, in 1917, between June and July, most of the XV Army Corps left Galicia and returned to Turkey.

The Ottoman effort, sending so many divisions to help Germany, Austria and Bulgaria, was extremely generous and helped to achieve the final victory of the Central Powers in the Eastern Front, but overall it was a strategical mistake. Turkey deployed some of its best soldiers far from home, so they couldn't be used to protect the Empire when the British invasions of Mesopotamia and Palestine started, or when the Arab Revolt began. The Ottomans contributed to destroy the Russian Empire, but they left their borders undefended as a consequence. In 1917 many of those soldiers retuned, but it was too late. The British were already at the gates of Gaza.
