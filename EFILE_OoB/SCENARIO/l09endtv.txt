TACTICAL VICTORY

Under your command the Dodecenasos are in safe hands. The division will be honoured as the conquerors of Leros! The British have already begun their evacuation of the few other islands they still laid claim on. 


AFTERMATH

After the Aegian campaign the division quietly continues occupying Crete and a number of other Aegian islands. 

In the autumn of 1944 the Soviets reach the Balkan and threaten the lines of communication and supply with Germany. During August and September 1944 the division is flown to Saloniki in the northern Greece to prevent the division from being cut off in the Aegian. The division assembled itself near Lake Doiran at the Macedonian border.
