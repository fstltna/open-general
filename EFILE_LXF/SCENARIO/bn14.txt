The campaign uses the "elite/green replacements" feature. Units which had suffered losses in battle, have experience points to pay if you use green replacement, depending on the amount of the losses. Your core units are not automatically refreshed after a scenario, so avoid wasteful or unnecessary attacks. Furthermore, you can add so-called attachments to your units that increase their effectiveness, but cost some prestige.

Enjoy!
