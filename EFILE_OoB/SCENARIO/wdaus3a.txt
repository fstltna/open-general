Situation report: As you know, the French have not been very cooperative since their surrender. They have refused our offer to oversee their interests in Syria and have vowed to fight any effort on our part to seize control. However, the arrival of Luftwaffe units in Syria has increased the possibility of the Germans affecting a takeover of their own. This cannot be tolerated.

Operational orders: You are charged with leading our invasion of Vichy held Syria. The code name for this operation is "Exporter." Any and all resistance from the French or German forces must be dealt with swiftly. Free French forces are also assigned to this mission, be especiallty careful not to mistake them for our Vichy foes.
