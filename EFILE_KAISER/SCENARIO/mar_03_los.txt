Telephonic conversation from General Fernández Silvestre's HQ:

Yes, mister President. The attack on Kesiva was carefully planned, but unfortunately the General who led the troops was badly wounded by an enemy sniper at the beginning of the combat. Without his leadership, his troops couldn't achieve the planned objectives.

Dead? No, the General will survive, but he has had one of his legs amputated. It will take many months for him to recover and even then he'll only be able to take administrative tasks in Spain. I regret to say that his career as a battlefield officer is over.
