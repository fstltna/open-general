General, coordinating with Guerrilla Forces in the southeast, enemy forces have repeatedly attacked our Forces in I-chang.  This has put us in a very awkward position.  These attacks have threatened the flanks of our troops in I-chang and Shashih.  You must alleviate this pressure by launching a series of attacks against the enemy.  Take Tanghsienchen and destroy all enemy forces!

ORDER - Capture all VHs!
