
MARHANGE - 18 JUN 1940

After our defeat at Dunkirk, the Germans have broken through our Weygand Line which ran from the frontlines at the Somme and Aisne Rivers to the Maginot Line. Paris has fallen and northern France is falling prey to the instoppable Germans. Even the Maginot Line is now under attack...

Your force is deployed in the Marhange area of the Maginot Line. It is one of the weakest sectors of the Line. The Germans have massed troops and artillery for an attack on this sector, defended by the 52e Division d'Infanterie and the Polish 1st Infantry Division. Together with your force and the Maginot Line bunkers and defenses you must hold out.

Your objective will be to hold to line and make some local counterattacks to remove the enemy from vital points in the field. Good luck, mon General, let the world show why we build our Maginot Line!

GOAL: Take all VH's!
