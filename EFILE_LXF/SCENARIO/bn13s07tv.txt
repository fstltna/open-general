TACTICAL VICTORY

Good job, mon General, although many French and British troops had to surrender. The forces are being shipped to Britain from where they will be transported back to France. Brest was the first option, but northern France will be under German control within days. Instead Toulon has been chosen. You will be reinforcing our Army of the Alps!
