[The Supreme druid approaches towards you:] 

Well, my prince!
Now collect your troops, and give your men some rest.... for the last full moon before the summer solstice, Vercingetorix has invited to a large all-Gallic state parliament in Alesia; all the princes of war shall appear there with all their men....
