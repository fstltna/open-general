Königgrätz was the decisive battle of the Austro-Prussian War. Although the Austrians and her allies, especially the Bavarians, still fought for nearly a month, it was obvious that it was an useless resistance. The Prussians were going to win the war. In the last days of July both sides signed an armistice and the peace treaty was approved in Prague on August 23, 1866.

As a result of the treaty, Central Europe changed completely. The German Confederation was dissolved, Prussia annexed many of Austria’s allies, and Austria herself was excluded from German affairs. Prussia created the North German Confederation, with all the German states except Austria, Bavaria, Baden, Württemberg and part of the Grand Duchy of Hesse. Austria lost the province of Venetia and, in order to survive, transformed into Austria-Hungary in 1867.

But Bismarck wasn't satisfied yet. He wished to incorporate Bavaria and the other remaining independent German states into an unified German Empire. France wouldn't tolerate that, but that wasn't a problem for the Prussian chancellor. He was ready for war, if necessary, and once again he started to look for excuses that would lead to it.
