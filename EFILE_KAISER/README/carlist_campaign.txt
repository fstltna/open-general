Mini carlist campaign, 1.872-1.87???

Made by Urica, 2013

1. Requirements for playing:

- The latest version of OpenGen
- The latest version of Kaiser efile General
- The 8 following maps:
Bilbao 1874 (1096), Eraul (1094), Estella (1098), Guadalajara (780), Montejurra (1095), Prut River (728), Santander 1874 (1097), Segre (808)

2. Mini campaign information:

There are 10 scenarios in total. The first four are linear. In Bilbao a TV or a defeat will lead to a historical path of three scenarios, ending in a Carlist defeat. A V or a BV will take you to a fictional path, also with three scenarios, ending in a Carlist victory. Any loss in the fictional path will take you to the historical one.

3. Acknowledgements:

To Luis Guzman and Juan Calos Preciado, without whom neither the game OpenGen nor the efile KG would be possible.
To Paqueo, Guille, Pzmaniac and JML, for testing this campaign and making more suggestions to improve it than I can remember.
