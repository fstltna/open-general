Gospodin General,
A British reporter, embedded in a unit of the Kavkaz Army, has prepared the text of his report for your review:  "The road to the West was open to the Turks, and those who could escape fled along it, quickly pursued by the Russian cavalry. The first report that reached Europe was that 100,000 men and 1,000 guns had been captured. This was an exaggeration. According to the official statement, the Russians captured 235 officers and 12,753 uninjured men, besides sick and wounded; 323 guns, nine standards, a vast supply of stores, and a very considerable quantity of ammunition."

The Kavkaz campaign of 1916 continued with two more major operations:  the capture of the port of Trapezond on the Black Sea coast in April and the defeat of a Turkish attempt to recapture Erzerum in August.  With the British Mesopotamian army surrendering at Kut, our operations in Persia and Mesopotamia ceased.  Your command will transfer to the European theater.

By 1917 the once mighty Kavkaz Army was reduced to a series of garrisons, totaling several tens of thousands of men:  the European fronts of the war continued to devour our troops.  In the summer of 1917 Turkey resumed the offensive:  only to be halted by an emerging Armenian army in 1919.
