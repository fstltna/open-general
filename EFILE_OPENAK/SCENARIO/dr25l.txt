Battle of the Hedgerows - August 1944 L

You did not succeed in eliminating the US beachhead. US forces have outflanked us by breaking through our lines near Coutance. Your mission is to push West to the shore in order to restore the front line and cut off the US divisions that have broken through. Do not fail us again!
