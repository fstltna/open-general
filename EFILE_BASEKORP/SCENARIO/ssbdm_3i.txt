   "Pfil the French 2nd is coming"  
  As anticipated the tanks of the French moved to attack the 11th SS 'Granna on the flanks.How could the French sit idle while the SS was trying to get around behind the Maginot line or cut loose and run thru French soil.Belgium Forces joined the French.The French 12th wing Fighters and Bombers were also ordered to attack.So far the women pilots of the SS had surprised not only the French but the Brits as well.In London Air Marshal Downing believed this to be a 'Fluke' so He anticipated the results in the skies over Namur to be lop-sided in favor of the French Air Force.In Berlin the Fuhress got info to Commander Pfil Kohler at Her Command post in the 'Rewand Forest on the movement of the 2nd and Her reply was "Good let them come,the Girls are ready.This will be one less Armee the French will have and the Girls do need more experience if they are to tangle later with the Bolshevik Menace.Also thanks for releasing Your Fighter Wing from Munich".The French 'Le Grande Armee was thought to be the finest in the World and still was in the minds of many.Panzers of the SS had caught them offguard,time would reticfy that and send the 'Dear Frau's back running to the Frauland.
