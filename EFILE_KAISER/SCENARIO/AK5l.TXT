Marasesti- August, 1917 - L

Oberstleutnant, you’ve wasted a great amount of precious lives, resources and time in a useless attack. We simply can’t afford that. We’re fighting a desperate war against some of the greatest powers in the world. If we give them the slightest chance, they’ll destroy Germany without hesitation. We can’t allow performances like yours at Marasesti.

Well, I guess it doesn’t matter. Russia is in the middle of a revolution, and seems determined to destroy herself. We’ll gladly help her to do that. Sooner or later the Russian revolutionaries will have to ask for peace, and Romania will follow. It will take longer than we desired, but finally, after so many sacrifices, the victory in the Eastern front will be a reality. However, we’ll find a new commander for the future operations of the Alpenkorps.
