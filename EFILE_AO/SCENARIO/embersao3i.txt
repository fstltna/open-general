INVERSION

Ryburn's Diary - May 20th, 2053

"It's been a while, I guess..."

"But some essential things have changed.  I couldn't even look at myself in the mirror without having it all flash before my eyes again.  We butchered women, children...burned the houses to the ground..."

"I left the same day the op ended.  There was no way I could face the men again.  I was no hero.  Neither were they.  We were all murderers, criminals!  In what just world and for what just cause did we exist?"

"I spent a while laying low.  I kept this to myself hoping I would find the strength to write again."

"One day a man in a trenchcoat approached me.  He knew my name; that was reason enough to follow him.  But before I could put the barrel to his head he had slipped me a note.  A chance to redeem myself, as it turned out."

"I'm here, with the rebels now...who would've thought.  And their leader, Phoenix, he's a nice guy.  I've met him and he seems to care about his men."

"It's time to strike a blow and reclaim hope.   One attack, near enough to the Arm bases to cause dismay and in a large enough city to mobilize the populace."
