SUWON (30 June 1950)

I see that you are eager to pursue the capitalist forces and destroy them, now we have the chance.  And we will!  They have concentrated just outside Seoul on the southern bank of the Han River and have blown the bridges.  We are certain that you will find a way to cross the river and liberate more of our beautiful peninsula!

The United Nations has passed a resolution in which we would have to stop our activities and retreat back behind the 38th Parallel.  Naturally, the capitalistic nations of the world are behind this.  There is a possibility that America and other nations will provide forces in support of the South.  Make speed so that we can liberate all of Korea before any decisive action can take place.  Once liberated the people in the South will show their gratitude and be happy to be reunited!
