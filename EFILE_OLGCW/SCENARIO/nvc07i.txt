Tet Offensive - Hue and Da Nang

February, 1968

Hanoi thinks we can take advantage of the two-day ceasefire announced for the Tet by striking now while the enemy is celebrating the holiday.  They should be in no position to quickly respond.

Your command will be split into two groups. One will take Hue, where the enemy 2nd ARVN Division's HQ and the MACV compound are located.  The other one must attack Da Nang wherea yankee marine infantry base is located. Some chinese-made rocket launcher batteries will be put under your command. Select your best troops for the offensive and take advantage of the surprise.

I suggest you to be quick, take up good positions before the enemy can react and then counterattack if you can.
