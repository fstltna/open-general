Herr General, I must congratulate you on this brilliant success. Gibraltar is ours.  Of course, our ally Spain will be given nominal soverignty over Gibraltar, but it will serve us as our base.  You handled this difficult assignment well.  After some well-earned rest and recuperation you and your men will undoubtedly be called upon to play a key role in our 1941 spring campaign.
