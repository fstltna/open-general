In 1923 the Government of India, then still under British rule, issued a specification for a basic but rugged goods vehicle with a cargo capacity of 30 cwt (1500kg).

To meet this Crossley designed a vehicle that they designated as the Indian Government Lorry or IGL. (After further versions appeared, the original became known as the IGL1.)

As well as India, the IGL was also sold on the home market and to South Africa and Canada. The chassis was also used to carry an armoured car body and when used for this purpose was designated as the IGA.

The engine used was the 4531 cc unit from the 25/30.
