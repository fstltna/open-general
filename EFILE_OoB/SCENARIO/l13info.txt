13. ZVORNIK (26 January 1945)

To the commanding officer of 22. ID (LL):

Belgrade has fallen under the combined assault of the Soviet and Yugoslav armies. The Yugoslav Army is now directing the divisions that fought at Belgrade west, into Bosnia and Croatia. There now is a real front against the Yugoslav Army instead of the partisan warfare, which though still continues behind our lines. 

The Yugoslav formations need the communications center of Zvornik with its roads and its bridge over the Drina River. Zvornik is the key to the large city of Tuzla which must be an objective for the enemy.

Your division must march and fight your way from the area of Sarajevo towards Zvornik and reinforce the garrison currently consist of the 41. Infanterie Division. Once Zvornik is reached and secured you must advance north and relief the 117. Jager Division at Janja and Bijeljina  which are important positions for holding the enemy at the other side of the Drina River.
