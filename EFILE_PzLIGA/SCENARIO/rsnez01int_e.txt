Auckland - New Zealand Invasion

December, 1942

The quick defeat of Australia will allow us to continue the conquest of the South Pacific. Now it's New Zealand's turn, where some Australian and American troops have escaped to.  They must not have another base here, New Zealand is like a big carrier, and it eventually could support an allied invasion of our new possessions in Australia.  From Tokyo, your orders are to assault the Auckland sector from two sides.  Special Naval Landing Forces (2nd and 3rd Yokosuka with paratrooper training) will support your mission.  Also seize the key island of Waiheke and its airstrip.   Like other battles we must capture all the enemy airbases because they have relative air superiority.   At the beginning of this battle I advice you to keep your air units in a defensive role.
