Ramnicu Sarat - December, 1916 - V

My congratulations, Oberstleutnant. Your determined attack in the Carpathians was of invaluable help for our offensive on Ramnicu Sarat. Romanian and Russian troops were tied down by your forces, and the enemy was not able to shift troops to the south, where they were desperately needed. Our breakthrough would not have been possible without you.

The campaign in Romania is far from over, since Russian reinforcements are pouring in day by day. But now it's time for you and your troops to take a well-deserved rest. You should celebrate New Year's eve and raise a toast to the New Year. Let's hope that 1917 will bring victory to our side and this was the last Christmas that we had to spend far from home!
