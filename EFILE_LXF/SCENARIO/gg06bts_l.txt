Totally appalling work by your XIX corps Herr General, for you the war is over.

The French General Staff considered the hilly and densely forested Ardennes region as "impassable" so it only lightly defended. This proved no hindrance to the German tracked vehicles with many road blocks undefended while the French had refused block the forest trails by felling thousands of trees because it would impede the advance of their cavalry! By evening on May 10th the French 2nd Light cavalry came up against the 10th Panzer Division and was thrown back. The following day the remainder of the cavalry screen was attacked by German armour and scattered into the woods where they were sprayed with machine gun fire. On May the 12th Guderian's forces captured Bouillon, emerged from the Ardennes and crossed the French frontier just north of Sedan. The French delaying action had lasted just two days- instead of the nine or ten that Gamelin thought he would have in hand to move up the slow moving French forces.
