Gospodin General-Leitenant, you have held the Gnila Lipa line long enough to allow the 8th Army to disengage from the Carpathian Mountains.  Joining the rest of the South-Western front, the 8th made a fighting retreat back across Galicia through the still fresh battlefields of the Autumn of 1914.

Securing the southern flank at Tarnopol by September, the 8th Army held the front.  To the north, the 3rd Army, continued its withdrawal under heavy German and Austrian fire.  Crossing the battlefields of Komarov-Tomashov and Rava Russka, the army approached a line along the Wierpz River at Kholm - once the Front headquarters during the Russian Galicia offensive in 1914.
