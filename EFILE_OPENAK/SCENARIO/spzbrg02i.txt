Galician Campaign

Part 3/4 of the "Blitzkrieg" minicampaign


"Morning Hauptmann! Nice to see you! And your men, of course! And last but not least their tanks! Follow me, please...

Service! Binoculars!

Now, do you see that bridge? We must cross it. I've heard that the last time the Poles were fast enough to blow it, but now we'll be faster than they. The road beyond it is blocked by some infantry and MGs. The village... nein, you can't see it from here, it's beyond the horizon, but take a look at the map... the village is also defended by some infantrymen. Problem is that the Poles know very well that we must finally turn back to north and that this road is our only path through the quagmire. They've collected some armour and wait for us to come... What? Nein, Herr Hauptmann, the only airplane I've seen during last 24 hours was a downed Stuka in the swamp. So it looks like... pardon! What? Oh, good news, thanks!

Hauptmann, it looks we've got a company. Elements of Slovak light division will reach our position in an hour. Come on, lets talk about details. The strength of both ours and the enemy armoured forces will be even, but with our superior tactics, we'll surely break through!"


Victory conditions: Capture the VH.

Hint: Poles have withdrawn across the river, leaving the whole clearway unoccupied, thus making their defense very strong.
