1939,  Austria, Czech and Moravia have been occupied. Now we test our Wermacht forces agianst the massive Polish military.

This campaign is 25 scenarios long and has very limited aux units. You fight with your core. Poland, France, Russia and more need to be comquered.
Build a combined core of approx 30 units. There are no special rules or tricks in the campaign, just lots of combat.
Knowing when to hold, retreat or advance will be your greatest ally.
Prestige is captured so you need to be mobile.
Expect most 2,3 & 4 engined bombers and forts to blow hexes when destroyed so be careful.
