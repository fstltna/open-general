Hungnam Pocket [Korean War]

11-12-1950, Hungnam, North Korea.

Again, your smashing attack has left the enemy forces on the ground isolated.  This is the situation at Hungnam.  The UN forces are surrounded from the North and South by us while the North Korean units will attack from the East.  However, the Hungnam port continues to be their main lifeline, supported by their overwhelming naval power.

Your mission is to reach the port of Hungnam while destroying all enemy forces along your way.  You must stop any UN evacuation as soon as possible.  A successful evacuation will be a victory for them.  The 2nd, 6th and 10th North Korean divisions (the 2nd Korean People's Army) will be under your direct command and the 20th PLA will arrive from the South as reinforcements.
