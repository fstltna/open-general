Unfortunately, the German Wehrmacht has proven itself much tougher than we thought. Somehow you managed to get our men ashore, but most of them died in the subsequent fighting. Luckily the Brits had a virtual cakewalk in their sector, so the invasion is a success in spite of your dubious efforts. Hopefully we can find some sector of the war to transfer you to that will spare us any further embaressment.
