May, 10., 1861 The St. Luis Arsenal


Dear Friend,
since I have been here I spent many years as Teacher and Editor of a "german" Journal....  
Me and my former Comrades have foundeed many gymnastics Clubs, Pubs, Factories... and Families...

For a long Time I have not thought about War and Battles.... but now our new freedom is threatened again. 
I will never admit that a Man will be another Man´s Slave!

...So again I move into Battle...


----{secret telegraph depeche to general}-----
THE WHITE HOUSE; WASHINGTON,

General,
with Excitement we hear that our german Friends have formed four volunteer Regiments.
We regret that we must inform you that we will not be able to send you Support because at the moment all Connections are in the Hand of our Enemy.

Recommend requisition of Weapons out of St.Luis Arsenal...!

Further orders to follow......

THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
-----{end of secret telegraph depeche}----



ORDERS:
what shall we do? Forward !!

TAKE ALL VH's

ADVICE FROM YOUR OLDEST SERGEANT:
nor purchase, nor upgrade possible....we need at first the St. Luis Arsenal and supply Connections to the North....
