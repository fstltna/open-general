Congratulations, Herr General! The siege was a complete success, most conspirators are under arrest and will be executed soon. Only the ringleader Polish General, Józef Bem managed to escape. You have also driven the Hungarians beyond the River Leithe. Now we can prepare a large scale attack against the Hungarians from three directions.
