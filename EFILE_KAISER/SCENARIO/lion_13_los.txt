Despite their heroic deeds the British soldiers, without any hope of receiving reinforcements, had to retire, and went back to the East Africa Protectorate. So, finally, we secured our southern border. Eritrea was safe for the moment, and the Mad Mullah, unwittingly, was helping us in Somalia, blocking all the Entente columns in the desert. So I was finally free to help in Gondar.

Our battles against the African Rifles were a relief for General Von Lettow-Vorbeck and his men, who were fighting a guerrilla war in German East Africa. During some months, the number of enemies that were chasing him decreased significantly.

Europeans tend to overlook the importance of the Ethiopian contribution to the war effort of the Central Powers. It's a mistake. We were relevant, not only in the African Front. Italy had to send four infantry brigades from Albania to Eritrea. That's nearly half of the Italian troops that had been deployed there. Do you see? Our sacrifice weakened the Entente in the Balkans, and that became extremely important just a few months later, when the Germans launched the Operation Teutoburg in June. We were absolutely relevant!
