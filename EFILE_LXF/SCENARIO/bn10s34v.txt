After your troops have reached the Gulf of Mexico at Apalachee Bay, you will turn to the north and advance to Columbus, Georgia. We leave the blockade of Florida and the destruction of the enemy troops standing there to our infantry. Meanwhile strong enemy forces from Alabama and West-Georgia advance east to the Atlantic Coast. Our plan is to trap, encirclement and destroy these forces!
