Good morning, Feldmarschall. A beautiful day, isn't it? This is at last the day we will take care of the British problem, and you will lead the way.

Now that we have drawn the attention of the USA it is quite urgent we clean up our neighborhood: Since the British refuse to form an alliance with us, it is imperative we force them into submission before summer. The British isles are a perfect base from which to invade us, and we need to make sure they won't be used by the Americans against us.

Now, according to our intelligence, they have turned their island into a fortress. There is absolutely no way we can land an invasion force there, the whole coast is fortified.
That's where you come into the picture: Your highly experienced troops will carve the beachhead we need to land our invasion forces. Don't fret, you will have help from inside: Our best spy in Great Britain will be there, guiding you, telling you what the enemi is doing in real time. Don't get him killed!

For our invasion to succeed we will need a port, and High Command considers Dover to be the best choice, given its proximity to the French mainland. Try to capture Dover and the neighboring ports, and clear the inland deep enough to prevent any counter-attack. Our army will take it from there.



Instructions: Capture the VHs. You control the spy and a first line assault force. An additional supply vessel is permanently added to your task force.
Note you obviously won't be able to upgrade or buy stuff while you're sailing the seas, so this might be your last chance to do so for some time.
