SITUATION:

Herr General, your victory in Norway allows us an opportunity to crush our old enemy, France. Their army is said to be the world's finest. We shall see! Now, we believe the Allies plan to push into Belgium in response to our offensive. Your task is to lead your forces through the Ardennes and emerge behind the enemy. Our victory at Sedan in 1870 made Germany a Great Power. Your victory at Sedan will return us to that status.  

ORDERS: 

Take all VHs in 11/14/18 turns for a BV/V/TV.

NOTES:

One air-transport is available.
