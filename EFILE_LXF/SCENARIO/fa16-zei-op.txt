03/07/1940   Time Runs Out

Time is running out, Everstiluutnantti.
The Soviets have encircled Viipuri and several enemy divisions are marching across the frozen bay of Viipuri. We have never suffered casualties this high. In fact we defend a front twice as long as at the beginning of the war with only half of the troops we had in the beginning.
Situation report: Grim. Russians are everywhere.
Enemy: Countless enemy divisions, several tank-battalions and a strong air force. More or less the whole 7th army. 
Our forces: Your group has to hold the shores. 

We are getting extremely short on supplies. It may become necessary for you to disband some units.

Attack the Russian bridgeheads and wipe them out. Viipuri (hex 31, 03) has to be held! It's our pledge in the upcoming peace negotiations. If possible lead a counterattack at Kaislahti (hex 27, 12) and hold at all costs. The longer you hold out the better is our bargaining position at the ceasefire and peace negotiations. Every minute counts.
