VICTORY

This time the Emperor Haile Selassie's lion-maned chieftains and uniformed captains moved forward together. Hand to hand fighting raged all along the line, particularly between the two Eritrean divisions and on the far edge of the Italian right, held by the Alpini.

It must have been with despair that in the confusion of the battlefield Haile Selassie watched the camel men of the Azebo Galla moving forward from over on his right, not as he was surely hoping to roll up the 1st Eritreans and sweep the whole Italian line in confusion, but instead to fall upon his own embattled warriors.

The Azebo Galla had betrayed them. There were many dead and more wounded.

The rains fell all the next day.  Amidst the wailing of their women and the chanting of their priests the Ethiopians collected their dead and buried them on the plain of Lake Ashangi.
