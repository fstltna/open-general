Herr General,

YOU HAVE DESTROYED EIGHT ARMY !!!!!!. This is a victory the axis needed this year. Mussolini is screaming his longs out at the Piaza Venezia. Hear this: 

"Oh sons of Ceasar, descendants of Scipio ! For years the Imperialist 8th army has twarthed us in the desert with huge amounts of superior arms ! Now just as they were as arrogant as Hannibal and invaded our homeland, you have shown them our Roman heroism !"  


Well you know the rest ! Though not all of it was employed the propaganda value alone of 8th army's defeat is a strategic victory for us. Now destroy the Americans and the Marshall wand wil most certainly be yours !
