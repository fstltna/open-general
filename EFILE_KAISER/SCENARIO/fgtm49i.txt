Riga
September 2, 1917

Gospodin General, we are witnessing the disentigration of the 12th Army (Klembovsky)!  At dawn on September 1st, the entire German 8th Army (Hutier) has gone on the offensive with the aim of surrounding our 12th Army at Riga.  Klembovsky, expecting a direct assault on the city, concentrated his best troops (the II and VI Siberian Corps) in fortifications around the city.  Hutier, however, deployed the bulk of his army at Friedrichstadt with the aim of crossing the Dvina River and breaking through toward Hiazenburg and assaulting Riga from behind.  The Germans have formed elite stormtrooper detachments for their breakthrough divisions.  In fact, entire divisions appear to have trained in advanced assault and infiltration tactics.

During the war, the Russian Empire has raised several native divisions:  Finnish divisions have been fighting with the Army since 1915.  The Czech Legion, raised out of Austro-Hungarian army's POWs, has been active since 1916.  The Estonian division is in training at Revel.  Finally, the Latvian division had been employed during the failed Mitau Offensive in January of 1919; they have deployed at Ropazhi.  The bulk of our regular army has become but a shadow of its might:  political instability has thrown the army into a state of disobedience at best and criminal desertion at its worst.  Whole regiments refuse to go into line.  So-called "soldier committees" have assumed command of entire divisions, stripping their officers of their rank or summarily executing them.

It is on the native divisions and on your formation, Gospodin General, that the North-Western Front depends in this hour.
