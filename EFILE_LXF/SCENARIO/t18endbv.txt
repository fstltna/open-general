An excellent performance, Marshall! You drove the Allied forces in front of you back to east and south. The Allied forces in Iraq have been dealt with: after your bold strike there are only very small contigents of Allied forces still in Iraq. Another Dunkirk! 

The war for Turkey is over. We succeeded in winning this war. You and your men were the key of our success. Special medals have been made for all those who fought in your force. Congratulations!

Turkey is once again a super power once again ruling the Middle-East from Palestine to western Persia, and from Trace to Iraq!
