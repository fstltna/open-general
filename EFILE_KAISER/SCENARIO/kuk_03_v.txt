Our lines have resisted. The Italians haven't been able to occupy the Isonzo valley, and we'll be safe for a while. Congratulations, General.

However, I'm afraid that the Italians won't give up. They will try again, and they have more men than us. We won't be able to hold them forever, especially if we keep on fighting on three fronts at the same time.

This needs to stop. We must defeat Serbia once and for all, before they receive reinforcements from France and Britain. But we can't do it alone. The Germans are willing to help, but if we could convince Bulgaria to join our side, too, things would be much easier. Let's hope our diplomats succeed in their negotiations with Czar Ferdinand I and His government.
