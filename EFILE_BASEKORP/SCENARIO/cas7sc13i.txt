Italy invaded Greece late last year without informing us beforehand. The Italians only managed to penetrate about 20km into the country, and were then thrown back by the Greeks! For a while, Albania was in danger of falling. Now the English have landed and that has made things worse. The situation is intolerable. General, after securing Yugoslavia, you have been chosen to lead the attack through the Thermopylae Pass, where the Greeks and British have entrenched themselves.
