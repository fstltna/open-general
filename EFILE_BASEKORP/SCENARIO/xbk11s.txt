Operation Marita, the plan to capture Greece has been complicated after a coup d'etat in Yugoslavia. 
This coup has ousted the government we signed a protocol with 2 days earlier - which is 2 weeks ago now - a protocol that brought Yugoslavia in the Tripartite Pact. 
The new government has canceled the protocol and Hitler thinks they will sooner or later join the Allies. He has ordered our troops to not only invade Greece as planned, but Yugoslavia as well.
