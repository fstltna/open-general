Dodge had been the United States military's primary supplier of light wheeled vehicles, since before the U.S. joined the First World War. After starting business in 1900, producing precision engine and chassis components for other car builders in Detroit - Ford and Oldsmobile chief among these - Dodge introduced their first car, the Model 30/35 tourer, in 1914. It was stronger and more high quality than the ubiquitous Ford Model T, and in 1916, Dodge cars proved their durability, both in the 1910s U.S. Mexico Border War- the U.S. military’s first operation to use truck convoys, as well as in World War I, when some 12,800 Dodge cars and light trucks were used, primarily as ambulances and repair trucks., but also as staff and reconnaissance vehicles. All the while, Dodge maintained its reputation for high quality truck, transmission, and motor parts they made for other successful manufacturers.

Dodge light trucks were initially based largely on their passenger cars, but later specific truck chassis and bodies were designed. Light- and medium-duty models were offered first, then a heavy-duty range was added during the 1930s and 1940s. Dodge developed its first four-wheel drive truck in 1934 - an experimental 1?1/2 ton for the U.S. Army, designated K-39-X-4(USA), of which 796 units were built in several configurations. Timken supplied driven front axles and transfer-cases, which were added to a militarized commercial truck. The Timken transfer case was the first part-time design, that allowed the driver to engage or disengage four-wheel drive using a lever inside the cabin. In spite of the limited 1930s U.S. military budgets, the ’34 truck was liked well-enough that the 1?1/2 tonners were further developed. Dodge built the U.S. Army further batches of 4WD 1?1/2-ton cargo trucks in 1938, 1939 and 1940. 1,700 RF-40-X-4(USA) trucks were procured in 1938, and 292 TF-40-X-4(USA) in 1939. All of these 1?1/2-ton Army 4x4s rode on a 143 in (363 cm) wheelbase, and the 1938 RF-40 and 1939 TF-40 trucks were the first to receive a Dodge engineering code in the 200 range (T-200 and T-201 respectively).

However, Dodge also eagerly pursued military contracts for half-ton four-by-fours at the same time. The smaller size had outperformed the 1?1/2-ton 4x4 during testing in 1938, and Dodge had invested greatly in half- to one-ton trucks in prior years. In 1936, Dodge's light, car-based trucks had been crucially redesigned — dropping the old car frames and for the first time using modern, truck-style chassis, with side rails welded to the cross members on their half-ton to one-ton rated trucks. Additionally, Dodge had built the all new, very large Warren Truck Assembly plant in Michigan for its light and medium trucks, opened in 1938. In 1939 again, Dodge presented a completely redesigned line of pickups and trucks. The modern looking, "Job-Rated" trucks aimed to fit every job.
