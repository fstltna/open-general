Mombasa

May 26th, 1943

This is the last strategic point controlled by the British on the African coast, once we will take it, the allies will be unable to counterattack because we will have in our hands all the important ports. The configuration of Mombasa City makes the assault very tough plus the presence of the Royal Navy will push your command to the extreme, but we trust you.
Good luck
