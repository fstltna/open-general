VICTORY

Thanks to your victory, the way to Vladivostok is open.  Our German allies are now very happy; these operations against the Bolsheviks have stopped the red offensive against the German positions in Eastern Europe.

Oh yes, some anti-Bolshevik elements we found have joined us against the soviet government, and they are now part of your command.
