Supporting the allies: Galicia - September 30th, 1916

Meanwhile, the XV Army Corps was deployed in Galicia, helping the Germans and Austro-Hungarians to cope with the new tactics that the Russians had developed during the Brusilov Offensive.The Ottoman divisions had initially been deployed on the west bank of the Zolota Lipa River. But just a few weeks later, on September 2nd, the Russians started an offensive against the  lines of the Central Powers on the Zolota Lipa Valley. 

The Ottomans and the Germans managed to hold their ground, although with heavy casualties, but the Austrian units were forced to retreat. Again, the poor Austrian performance in battle endangered her allies, who now were in risk of being encircled by the Russians. General Bothmer, the commander of the South Army, had no choice but to order a general retreat on September 5th. Most of the Turkish units went to the west, to Verkhnya Lypytsya and the surrounding villages. However, the Russians kept on trying to break the Ottoman lines, and they launched several assaults in the following days. The last one, and maybe the fiercest, took place on September 30th, when the 3rd Caucasian Corps attacked on the Turkish line.

Orders: 
- At the end of the scenario, holding 3 victory hexes gives you a brilliant victory. Hold 2 for victory and 1 for a tactical victory.

Intelligence report: The enemy air force is significantly stronger than in previous battles, so be careful.
