Message from General Primo de Rivera's HQ:

You've done it again, General. Your mission was extremely difficult, but with your heroic march you managed to save most of our Army. Our men are behind safe positions now and the losses have been minimal.

By the way, did you know that our old enemy El Raisuli has been taken prisoner by Abd el-Krim? It seems that he hates Abd el-Krim and in the end he wanted to make a deal with us, but he came too late. El Raisuli's health is poor so I don't think he will survive for long in prison.

Now I have to think about our next move. Spain is almost bankrupt and we lack the resources to continue this war without some support from France, so it's important to get along with the French authorities. Otherwise we will be forced into some kind of peace treaty with Abd el-Krim.
