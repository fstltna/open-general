Pyongyang

Sep 15th, 1894

In the following nine years things improved greatly. It was a extremely difficult task, though, because each and every tiny reform had to overcome the indolence, corruption and fear of innovation that, unfortunately, were too common among the Chinese bureaucracy. But in the end we could create some excellent infantry units, equipped with modern rifles and supported by good artillery pieces.

We had to make use of them before I had thought. For some time Japan had expanded its influence in Korea, which was a tributary state of China. Naturally, that caused tensions and incidents between both countries since even before I came to live in Asia.

But finally the tension exploded. In June 1894, the Qing government sent troops to Korea, in order to supress a rebellion against King Gojong. Infuriated, the Japanese sent troops to Korea, too, and they acted extremely quickly. Before the end of the month they captured King Gojong, occupied the Royal Palace in Seoul and imposed a  pro-Japanese government. The Qing Empire declared that the new Korean government was illegitimate and on 1 August declared war on Japan.

The Japanese continued to make fast moves, and in September they had already occupied most of Korea. Then our best troops converged on Pyongyang, ready to defend the city for as long as they could, waiting for the chance to counterattack. They were facing the Japanese First Army, composed of the 5th and the 3rd Divisions.
