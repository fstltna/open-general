Ekaterinburg, Russia
Ekaterinburg stands as the gateway through the Urals where the Chinese continue to strip Russia of its precious resources. Your victory at Astrakhan has paid off as the Russians were able to field a force from Volgograd in time to join our assault through the mountain pass. The U.S. force is charged with the capture of Ekaterinburg and securing the rail lines running east into Siberia; the Russian force advancing toward Sysert’ from the south is to provide flanking support.
