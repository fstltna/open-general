SPRING OFFENSIVE SECOND PHASE (14 May 1951)

You must have heard it already at the Chinese headquarters Comrade General but let us go through the situation once more.  The offensive directed at Seoul has been halted in favor of a new offensive in the central and eastern sectors where the terrain is more to our advantage.  In the mountains the Americans cannot use their artillery and aircraft to full advantage.  Your Corps, along with major Chinese units, have been transferred to these sectors.  This offensive must succeed, Comrade General.  Do not let us down!
