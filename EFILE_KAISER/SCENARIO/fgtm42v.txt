The bloodletting of Narotch has stunned the Northern and Western fronts: over 100,000 Russian casualties accounted for no ground gained and roughly 20,000 German.  What looked like a 5:1 manpower advantage prior to the operation turned into a slaughter.  Having rushed the operation in response to a French plea for help, both fronts failed to prepare their artillery arms adequately: only 50% of alotted artillery pieces supported the attack, while the rest awaited deployment at railroad hubs and depots.  Wave after wave of our infantry were gunned down by murderous machine guns entrenched in casemates of concrete and steel.  Even after capturing an enemy trench, our troops perished in the counter-attacks that followed from the enemy's reserve.
This operation did, however, achieve the effect the French had hoped for:  the German OHL did not divert a single division from the Eastern Front, making use of their last reserves in repulsing our attacks.  Even knowing what this pyrrhic victory achieved for our allies at Verdun will not lay the perished souls to rest in the snows of Narotch.
This operation has effectively reduced our Northern and Western Fronts to a passive role for the remainer of 1916.
