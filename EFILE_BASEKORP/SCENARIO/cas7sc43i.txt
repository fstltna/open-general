General, there are alarming news coming from South East Asia. Evidently a certain Colonel S. Brown are leading a revolt against us. Rumour as it that Mr. Brown is a specialist in jungle warfare and stacked fortifications, so cut his forces off
before they manage to disappear into the interior of Malaya. Your orders are to defeat this Hr. Brown and his forces within ten weeks! You have a relatively simple task, though - land on the western coast of Malaya and cut off Singapore from the mainland!
