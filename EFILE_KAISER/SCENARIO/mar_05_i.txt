1920 Advance into Xauen

September, 20th, 1920

Message from General Berenguer Fusté's HQ:

Our alliance with El Raisuli has deteriorated beyond recovery. His demands in order to keep his friendship have grown immensely and have become unacceptable. 
I am determined to put an end to El Raisuli's insurgence. The time has come to take the Berber strongholds on the Djebala and Gomara mountains. You will command our troops in the field. 

Our main objective will be the holy town of Xauen, a religious center for the Moroccan people. The taking of Xauen by the Spanish army will be a great blow for the morale of the rebels and for El Raisuli's prestige and our victory in Morocco will be much closer.   


Victory conditions: Take all VHs.

Tip: On turn 5 you will receive reinforcements from the SW.
