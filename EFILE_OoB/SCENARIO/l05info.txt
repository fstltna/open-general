05. PEREKOP (18 October 1941)

To the commanding officer of 22. ID (LL):

While the other Armeen of Heeresgruppe Sud are advancing east, 11. Armee, that includes your division, is aiming at the Crimea. To gain access to that important peninsula, first control of the Perekop isthmus is required. The previous weeks attacks from both sides have resulted in a stalemate across the isthmus.

Most of your division will assault the enemy positions and not only gain control of the Perekop isthmus but also advance further whenever possible. Elements of 46. and 73. Infanterie Division will support you. Only brute force will gain us victory. One of your regiments supported by an artillery battalion of your artillery regiment, guards a small isthmus further east which has been found impossible to mount an offensive on.
