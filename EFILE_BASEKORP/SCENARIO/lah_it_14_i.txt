We have been ordered back to the Eastern Front after our rest in Italy.  We are back with the 4th Panzer Army, and we are going to launch a counter-attack to destroy the Soviet bridgehead on the Dnieper.  First we are going to advance on Zhitomir.  We are supported by the 1st and 9th Panzer Divisions.
