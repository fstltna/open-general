Brussilow-Offensive: Luzk

Jun 4th, 1916

Welcome back to the front, General. I wish we could have given you a warmer welcome, but as you see, we don't have time for that. If we don't react quickly, the Russians will destroy us.

This new Russian offensive took us by surprise. In fact, these past months had been really good. After our breakthrough in Görlitz, we had liberated all the lands that we had lost in 1914. The Germans took Warschau, and the Russians were forced to defend themselves into their own empire. The front had been quiet lately. The lines seemed stabilized. 

And then, all of a sudden... this. We didn't see it coming. They're storming our lines. We must do something to delay the Russian offensive, and give our men enough time to retreat in order. We couldn't endure another Premissel. The Empire would collapse. Save us, General, hold our lines against the assaults of the Russian 8th Army!
