00. FORTRESS HOLLAND (10 May 1940)

STRATEGIC SITUATION:
The world is at war. Germany has finally attacked in the West too and has invaded Belgium and our country as well, despite our wish to remain neutral. But now we have no choice. We must fight as brave and hard as we can, alongside our new allies, England and France. The Germans have invaded our country on the entire front. At the same time paratroopers have been dropped inside the economical, political and military heart of our country, Holland. Fortress Holland, as we call it in military terms, must be held. The German paratroopers expect their main force to join within days. Before that date you must have defeated them and retaken the lost important positions and prevent them from taking new strategic positions. Our army, navy and airforce are no match for the German might but we will die heroically!

TACTICAL ORDERS:
German paratroopers have landed at various airfields and have obtained strong positions but are isolated. They rely on their powerful airforce. Your men of 4th Infantry Regiment must take back the airfields of Ockenburg, Iepenburg and Valkenburg as well as prevent them from crossing the Maas river at Rotterdam and prevent them from taking our political capitol of The Hague.
