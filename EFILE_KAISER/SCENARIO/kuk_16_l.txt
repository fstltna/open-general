Although you've failed, the Germans have destroyed the Italian army in the north, taking thousands of prisoners. The Italians have fled to the outskirts of Venedig and won't dare to attack us for some time. For the first time in two years, the Empire is safe.

With Serbia defeated, Russia falling apart and Italy on the defensive, we don't have any real reason to remain in this war. It's a pity that France and the United Kingdom are so stubborn that they won't accept a negotiated peace. We'll have to keep on fighting until one side finds a winning strategy and the other collapses. 

Since the United States hasn't entered the war, the Germans think that they don't need any reinforcements in France and Belgium. That means that, if Russia finally surrenders, we'll be able to reinforce the secondary fronts, and destroy the Entente forces there. So prepare yourself, General. If Russia falls, our next goal will be winning the war at the Balkans.
