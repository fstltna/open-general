All right, time has come to finish off the exile British government and to build a bridgehead in North America: We are going to attack and conquer Canada.
Well, you are, Feldmarschall.

First things first, we need to secure our supply lines, so your first task will be to neutralize that annoying USAAF base in St Johns in Newfoundland. They have a lot of planes, a submarine base, and also some convoy escorts are based there, but it should all be but a mere formality for somebody who managed to capture Pearl Harbor. Your biggest problem will be the weather; We can't afford to wait till spring, the Americans have an incredible production capacity and will be totally unassailable in a couple months. It's now or never.

The good news is this is now our main project and will get our entire focus and resources. We have assembled our best troops into new structures which will progressively join your forces, along with the rest of our navy. You will wield a considerable power now.


Instructions: Capture all VHs. You get lots of new core units, including a new modern battlecruiser, an small escort carrier (with planes) and a second carrier/cruiser hybrid (with planes).
As usual, all capital ships you get are MSU, don't lose any!
Also, this might be the last occasion for upgrades and purchases, you won't be back for a while.
