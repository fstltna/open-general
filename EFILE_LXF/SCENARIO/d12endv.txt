VICTORY

Good job, commander. After very heavy battles you have succeeded in securing Tarakan, its airfield and its oil fields. The Japanese are no longer a threath to the Allied positions on Tarakan. Very well done.

AFTERMATH:
In August 1945 the Japanese ask for a truce. After the war in Europe, the war in the Pacific comes to an end too. You have fought bravely starting in those early desperate days in May 1940 when the Germans attacked our country. You faced the overwhelming Japanese in early 1942 as they attacked our colony of the East Indies. In 1943 you turned the Japanese threath on Merauke. But in 1944 the tide turned and you started with liberating our country in Europe from the Germans. And in 1945 you assisted the Allies in clearing the first parts of the Dutch East Indies as well. You and your force proved to be born for war and proved to be excellent fighters. Now go home and think of the battles you fought for your country!
