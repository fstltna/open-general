Invasion!

Orders:

Now it is the time to do what Napoleon wasn't able to do! Now is the time to throw everything at the enemy we have.
We mobilised thousands of landing crafts and moterboats, figthers and bombers, dozens of cruisers and battleships and we'll carry out the largest landing operation in history.
Your orders commander: Cross the Strait of Dover and make landfall at the coast of Kent. Establish a beachhead and make your way to your objectives. Since our operations against Portsmouth and Southampton we don't expect naval attacks in the south-west.

Historical Info:

Following the Fall of France, the Germans hoped the British government would seek a peace agreement and reluctantly considered invasion only as a last resort if all other options failed. As a precondition, they specified the achievement of both air and naval superiority over the English Channel and the proposed landing sites from around Ramsgate to beyond the Isle of Wight, but the German forces did not achieve both at any point during the war. The invasion was postponed indefinitely on 17 September 1940 and it was never put into action.
