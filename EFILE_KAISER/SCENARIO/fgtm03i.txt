Shakhe East, 29 Sept (12 Oct) 1904
Gospodin General-Major, having made contact with Japanese forces, the bulk of our army continues south toward the town of Lyaoyan.

The Japanese are attempting to regain the initiative and are advancing forward, intentsifying the battle in the center.  General Kuropatkin plans to outflank the advancing Japanese with the 1st Siberian Cossack Division (Samsonov) and the Zabaikal Cossack Division (Rennenkampf).  You are advised to maintain a defensive stance in the center, while strengthening your left (south-east) flank to assist Samsonov and Rennenkampf.

Do not plan on receiving many reinforcements for this battle:  Kuropatkin has refused to commit all of his troops, fearing a sudden break-through by the Japanese against one of his flanks.
