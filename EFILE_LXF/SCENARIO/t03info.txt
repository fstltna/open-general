20 September, 1941

The war has begun, General! The Germans attacked our sworn enemy, the Soviet Union, and asked us to join them. We agreed. It is clear that Britain will declare war on us too, but they did not yet. This gives us the time to conquer the Caucasus. Our Army is not entirely a modern army, but the Germans will give us more support with each day. We assembled troops, your division included, and most of our airforce in this area. We will attack Batumi, an important Russian harbor.  The Russians have a fortified bridgehead on the west bank of the Coruh river, but will be encircled when you accomplish your task quickly. And beware, General, the obvious way, is not always the easiest one! Good luck, General.
