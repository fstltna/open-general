HQ Army Group B, Germany
General Fedor von Bock

The storm in the west is approaching. For months your paratroopers have trained for the attack on the bridges over the Albert Canal and the fortress Eben-Emael. The occupation of these key positions is absolutely necessary for our further advance. I count on you. Good luck, Lieutenant Colonel!
