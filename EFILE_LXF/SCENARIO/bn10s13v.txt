You have achieved all objectives, the mission was a complete success. Good work!

Through our victory in Palestine, we are now able to support the pro-German nationalists in Iraq effectively. Despite our support in late May, the Commonwealth troops managed to defeat the Iraqi army and the government was forced to flee to Syria. The General Staff knows that the continuous struggle in the last months has led to tiredness of the troops and the equipment. However, it would be inexcusable not to take advantage of that prevailing chaos in Iraq and to wait until the Commonwealth's have established again. We could force Abdallah ibn al-Hussain, the Emir of Transjordan to agreed to a transit of our troops through its territory into Iraq. You have order to traverse the Nefud desert and attack the RAF base in Habbanyah east of Ramadi!
