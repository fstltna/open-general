What a disaster! After existing for more than six hundred years, the Ottoman Empire is about to be destroyed. You've tried, but you couldn't save it.

What will we do now? Soon, the British will threaten again our hegemony in eastern Europe, and the German offensive in France will be less likely to succeed. Actually, the British could just wait until the effects of their naval blockade become unbearable, and force us to surrender. No matter how many battles you've won, General, a single failure may be enough to knock us down. I expect you to resign immediately, and for the good of our Empire let's hope that your successor is luckier than you.
