03. BRNO 2 (30 October 1938)

Thanks to your victory some days ago, we have breached a hole in the Czech front.  The Czechs are doing everything to plug the gap. They have rushed forces from the area and reserves and are ready to counterattack.

All other armies are attacking Czech forces as best as possible to drain reserves to bind Czech forces. However intelligence reports that elements of four to six divisions are heading for Brno and Olomouc. You must stop them.

Also after you have succesfully stopped the Czech counterattack, you are ordered to advance west and capture the passes over the hills and mountains leading to Bohemia and Prague.
