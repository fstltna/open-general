17. MOBIAI RIVER (17 June 1945)

Today the advance towards Buin has resumed. The troops on the Commando Road in the north will advance on this road which will now go south to merge with the Buin Road in the south. From the south forces will attack north until both forces, from the north and south, have made contact. Furthermore, you have to keep advancing east and cross both the Mobiai and Mivo Rivers.

Earlier today, a leading tank of an armoured column has been disabled by enemy fire and is more or less blocking the Buin Road. There is nothing we can to remove it right away so your men and material will have to go around it. Good luck, commander!
