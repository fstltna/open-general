The war in China is over, although it hasn't been thanks to your effort or your skills. Our allies have done most of the job. Well, a victory is a victory, I guess. You've been very lucky.

Now we'll occupy Peking. The Chinese government will pay for all the crimes that they've committed and for all the destruction that they've carried out. We'll demand the Empire to pay an indemnity to all the coalition countries, and besides they'll have to punish severely all the officials who supported the Boxers. We'll not allow this madness to happen again.

We don't really need you in China anymore, so you'll return to America. One of our ships will take you in Taku in less than a week. You'll be in San Francisco before the end of the summer, and if you remain in the Army maybe you'll have a second chance to prove your value in the future.
