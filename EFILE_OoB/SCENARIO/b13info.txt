13. SLATER'S KNOLL 1 (3 March 1945)

Australian forces have advanced up to the Puriata River and patrols are indicating that there are large enemy concentrations on the other side. We will pause here and get supplies and reinforcements to the front. 7th Brigade has been stretched to the maximum.

You have orders to cross the Pariata River, though, and capture a hill known as Slater's Knoll. This position is known to be occupied by Japanese troops and serves as an ideal artillery position. It is vital that this hill is captured, furthermore as it could serve as bridgehead once the general advance resumes. 

Next to this assignment you have orders to patrol the mountains in your rear. Aircraft have reported enemy activity. Once this area is cleared, more troops will be free for active duty instead of garrisoning towns in our rear. Good luck, commander.
