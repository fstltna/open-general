Cantigny

May 28th, 1918

The moment of truth has come. We declared war on Germany more than one year ago, on April 4 1917, and just a few weeks later our first Doughboys landed in Europe. However, most of our regiments needed to be reequipped and properly trained, so actually most of our troops didn't arrive until the end of the year.

Now we're finally ready, and it's about time. A couple of months ago the Germans started a series of attacks along the Western Front, and although they've suffered heavy losses, this time it seems that they could finally break through the French or British lines at any time. That is, unless we intervene and give support to our allies.

But, before sending the bulk of the American Expeditionary Forces to the front, the French want to make sure that we're capable of beating the Germans. So we must make a test and prove our ability. Your mission is to retake the village of Cantigny. That's where the Krauts stopped their first spring drive, and reducing the salient will be a blow for their morale. Go ahead and teach the Germans a lesson. The French will provide aerial and artillery coverage.
