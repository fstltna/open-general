General,

I know the Germans have given you a hard stroke but you have received as reinforcements our elite troops and you should have performed much better. I am afraid you should look for new challenges.  

A new mission is waiting for you. Go to the canteen and let's hope you are able to cook "Hennepot".

Le Chef d'Etat-major général de l’armée (EMGA).

Historical note:

In reality, contrary to other German bridgeheads (e.g. Ronsele), Belgians were not able to recover the lost ground and could only temporary stop the German Army. Other attacks were repelled in the area and indeed heavy losses were inflicted to the Germans.
