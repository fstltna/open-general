" I counted 11 there, 3 more over there,and look 2 Red Army tanks.And I only see that MP 40 and that anti-tank rifle,no explosions of Stiks are any other aid". "She must a been a Hell of a Frau,lot Dam better than Me and You that is for sure"."Yes,I agreed on that.Shame that great a Frau has to pay the Price as steep as Life for the Fuhress".Slowly more Fraus climbed the Hill to see the scene.Minutes later Frau Leutenaunt Hessler showed up,"What's going on here"? "Shit Hessler open Up Your eyes" Tiche responded," can't You see someone who puts us all to shame has gave Her Dam Life to stop the Bolsheviks here.Take off one of those Dam Medals You got for kissing Ass and Pin It on Her Corpse.For once in Your Life Hessler do something Right,eveyone here knows how You got Your Medals"."Tiche Your going to go too far one of these Days and I'm going to have You thrown behind bars". "Promises, Promises.
