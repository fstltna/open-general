First battle of the Crna Bend

October 5th, 1916

Although you did a great job at Malka Nidzhe, the enemy offensive against Bitolya goes on, harder than ever. We haven't got enough soldiers to overcome the French pressure, so we'll evacuate Bitolya and build a strong defence line north of that town. However, that will take some time.
Meanwhile, you will have to face the main enemy blow at the bend of Crna River. There, two Serbian divisions and three French divisions are ready to cross the river and take positions on its left bank. You must stop them at all cost, thus giving us enough time to organize our defence strategy.

Intelligence report: Beware of the enemy air force.

Victory conditions: Take all VHs.
