VICTORY

Excellent, comrade. You have stopped the Rumanian fascists! Furious fights have shown the tenacity of the Red Army in war! However the bridgehead cannot be held. As you have noticed the enemy is close to cutting us off from the rear. You have orders to pull back to our side of the Prut River and await new orders.
