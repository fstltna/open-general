Herr General, you already know that the enemy has launched an amphibious operation south of Naples, near Salerno. The terrain in this part of Italy is hilly and rugged, and we have been able to contain the enemy beachhead thus far. It is of critical importance that the Americans and British are not allowed to gain a foothold on the continent. We are relying on you and your crack troops to throw the enemy into the sea. Failure here is not an option.

One complicating factor that you must be aware of is that the Allies are attacking us with air units based in Sicily.  Unfortunately there is nothing we can do to attack these air bases.  The Luftwaffe will have to defeat the Allied air forces in Italian air space to gain air supremacy over the battlefield.
