On May 10 1940 the German army invaded Belgium and the 5th & 7th Panzer Divisions started their race towards the Meuse river.
In that race towards the Meuse river through the Belgian Ardennen forest the 7th Pz Div under the command of Rommel took the lead, the 5th Pz Div under the command of Hartlieb was stuck in the roadblocks in Saint Vith.
On May 11 the Germans crossed the Ourthe river and on the afternoon of May 12 the recon unit of the 5th Pz Div (this time temporarly under the command of Rommel), Vorausabteilung Werner reached the Meuse in Yvoir were one Meuse bridge was still intact.
- Blitzkrieg! The Western allies never expected the German to move this fast, the French army was still deploying its troops.
The Belgian army managed to blow up the bridge when the first armoured vehicles were crossing it.
Another attempt to take the railroad bridge in Anhee also failed.
Now all the bridges on the Meuse were destroyed but not the locks, the allies didn't want to destroy the locks because if they did, then they would lose the control about the water level in the river, it turned out to be a fatal mistake.
During the night of May 12/13 the German recon troops used an island in the Meuse at Houx, the border between the French 18DI & 5DIM, to start their river crossing, the found the locks intact and crossed the river on the foot bridge.
So on May 13 the Germans had a bridgehead on the Meuse and they started to ferry their troops accros, now the battle for Anhee could begin.
