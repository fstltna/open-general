April 6th, 1954
Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Carter here.  I know you've missed me, Commander.  Not everyone gets to take six months off between operations.

Something unusual is going on with America's friend along our southern border.  The jungles of the Yucatan Peninsula are notoriously difficult to navigate and are home to little more than the local natives.  Yet, recently there have been stories of men in gray uniforms and of modern combat tanks rolling through the jungle and taking control of the villages there.  Not exactly an accurate description of the Mexican Army, which we've infiltrated with numerous plants, so the question begged is: who's running around in the Yucatan?  The Soviets?

Robert Blake and his A.O. company have been dispatched to perform recon and provide a report.  Provide an escort and investigate the matter yourself, but do not allow Blake to be killed; he's a favorite of the higher ups, and I'd hate to see you get demoted.

Move north to the designated rendevous cabin, but if things get hairy, move to secure the road to your north so that we can bring in your full A.O. unit.  You won't be able to handle a full strength enemy force with just your recon group.

Carter out.
