East off Haiphong, Gulf of Tonkin
CO Admiral Nobutake Kondo

We will take advantage of the weakness of France due to the war in Europe and occupy French Indochina to close this supply loophole to China. The 5th Division crossed the border in the north already on 22 September and march toward Hanoi. Landing your troops at Haiphong and occupy Hanoi before Army units reach the city. It is a question of honor for the Navy to reach Hanoi first. If necessary use air transport to get around quickly.

BACKGROUND

In September 1940, the Japanese occupied Vichy French Indochina in order to prevent the Republic of China from importing arms and fuel through French Indochina along the Sino-Vietnamese Railway, from the port of Haiphong through Hanoi to Kunming in Yunnan. The fighting, which lasted several days before the French authorities reached an agreement with the Japanese, took place in the context of the ongoing Sino-Japanese War and World War II. Japan was able to occupy northern Indochina, tighten the blockade of China and make a continuation of the drawn-out Battle of South Guangxi unnecessary.

The Roosevelt Administration responds to Japanese expansion in Indochina by citing the United States Export Control Act and places a ban on the export of steel, scrap metal and all oil exports, including aviation fuel, to Japan. The embargo hits the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) hard since the Navy depends on United States oil imports for 80-90 percent of its fuel. Great Britain and the Netherlands also embargo oil exports to Japan.

The IJN estimates that it has less than two years of bunker oil remaining. Therefore, the IJN lends its support to existing Japanese plans to seize oil resources in the Dutch East Indies.
