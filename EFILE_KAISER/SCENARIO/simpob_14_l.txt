After so many battles, fatigue had affected my mind and my body. I suffered a breakdown at the worst possible time, and I had to be relieved from command. Victory was finally ours, but to this day I still regret not having been able to participate in this heroic deed until te end. My family always tries to cheer me up when they see that I'm in a sad mood, but I can't help thinking that, somehow, at the moment of truth Glory avoided me and I failed my country.
