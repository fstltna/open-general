Good work, General. We already have a much improved access to the Aermelkanal [English Channel] and this might tip the scales if our advance into France proves to be indecisive - and the current plan is VERY indecisive despite Von Manstein's changes! Would you believe a plan consisting of "stop at the Meuse"?
