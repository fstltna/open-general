SITUATION:

We now have to advance further northeast trough the desert. The minarets of Alexandria will soon be in sight at the horizon. But be cautious, the British still have a considerable number of troops in this area.

ORDERS: 

Take all VHs in 18/22/28 turns to get a BV/V/TV.

NOTES:

Some of your Paratroopers have been equiped with captured british Bedford trucks.

You may buy some strength points or attachments for your two core units now.

Your army fields two supply/healer units in this scenario as well as a stationary hospital tent. Use them to heal and supply your adjacent units.
