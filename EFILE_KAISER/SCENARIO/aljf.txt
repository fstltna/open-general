In 1848 the ("2nd") german empire is a patchwork of more than 350 kingdoms, counties etc....

Striving for a united, free, democratic Germany is becoming stronger and stronger and finally ends in a revolution in the southwest of the empire.

Friedrich Hecker and many others proclaim the revolution march towards the capitals collecting men and weapons on their march.
The revolution is stopped bloodily by the prussian army. Being better trained and much more they force the revolutionists to flee. They go to Switzerland and from there most of them go to the just established USA where they hope to live in freedom.

After the break-out of the civil war they choose the side of freedom and because of their military experience in 1848 they are willingly recruited as officers by the Union. 
"German" Gymnastics and sportsclubs join the Unionarmy as Volunteer regiments.
In fact nearly 25 % of the Uniontroops have german origin and for the moral of these troops it is favorable to have "political" generals like Franz Sigel.
