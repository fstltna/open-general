HQ 1st Parachute Army, Spain
General Kurt Student

After the Allies landed in Spain and Portugal we could stop their advance at Valladolid in Spain. Now it is time to destroy the Allied armies. The Portuguese harbour Porto is the main supply basis of the Allies. You will take the port with your paratroopers and cut the Allied supply line. Also, in this area some Portuguese troops revolting against the Allied occupation and will support our attack. A second Dunkirk will not take place! Good luck, General!
