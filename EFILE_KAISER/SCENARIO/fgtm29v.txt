Gospodin General-Leitenant, you have once again displayed inspirational skill on the battlefield.  Holding the enemy at the San, you have provided cover for the entire South-Western Front to realign its supply structure and to redeploy the northern wing behind the San River line.  This time has also been valuable in the preparation of counter-offensive actions on the tactical level to delay the enemy advance further:  at the Prut' River the XXX Corps has been making preparations for such action.

The southern wing of the front has been deployed on the Carpathian mountain passes and has the exceedingly difficult task of disengaging from the enemy and maintaining cohesion, while it catches up to the rest of the front's retreat.
