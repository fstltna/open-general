My victory has been so absolute that the Bolsheviks have retreated from much of the Kuban and Denikin has changed his mind. We'll still retreat most of the civilians and some soldiers to Crimea, but we'll leave enough troops to defend the Taman and Novorossiysk. We'll build strong lines of trenches, fortifications, tunnels and bunkers, so when the communists decide to attack us again they'll be incapable of passing through them. This area will be safe for a long time.

However, we still have a weak point at the Perekop Isthmus. Should it fall, all of Crimea would be in danger. Denikin has ordered me to go there and command its defence, and I'll arrive as soon as possible. It's more that just my duty: my family's safety depends on it. Katya, the children and Olga, Anatoly's wife, who is expecting her first child, have been evacuated to Simferopol, so I must do my best in order to prevent the Reds from taking Crimea.
