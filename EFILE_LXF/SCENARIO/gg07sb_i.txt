Herr General,

Take advantage of the French confusion and break though the defences around Sedan, cross the river and execute a pincer movement to take all objectives and encircle any French forces caught straggling. Again time is of the essence.

XIX Corps Battleplan:

1. Split your Corps into 2 battlegroups and cross the Semois river.

2. KG East should capture Sedan and cross the Meuse where a bridgehead will be established. Divisional Artillery should be available later in the day to help destroy the fortifications from over the river.

3. KG West should be a small fast moving force and will wheel west and cross the Meuse at Charleville-Mezieres, taking the town and continuing on towards Liart.

3. Once KG East has formed a secure bridgehead it will be reinforced while the main KG heads south to take Stonne then west towards Rethel.

Player Note: Keep your MSU Bridging Tank alive.
