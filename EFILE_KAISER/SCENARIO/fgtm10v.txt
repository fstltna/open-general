Gospodin General-Major, you have forced the Austrian 3rd Army (Brudermann) to go into full retreat, exposing the fortress of Lemberg before us.  Strategically, this creates a critical opportunity for a counter-stroke.  The Austrian 4th Army (von Auffenberg) has pushed into Galicia and lost contact with the 3rd on its right.

No time is to be lost now:  with each new day the Austrian armies receive reinforcements from the Balkan 2nd Army.
