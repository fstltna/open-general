"Commander Karlle,look"."Yes I see Tarra,the same look on that bunch.We got replacements coming.These Girls got to be gotten out of the lines for a while or We are going to have them all go Mad.You go over there and tell them the Replacements will be here soon and I will watch their reaction".So Frau Sargent Tarra went over to the line of Zombies and gave them the Good News.Most showed no signs of interest at all,they had heard it before but it came to nothing.One Frau finally spoke up."Sargent,get the Hell out of My face before I take My Daggar out.Go on back over there with that Bitch Officer.You and Her have a Good Time while all of us here wait til Ivan shows up again.We've had enough,We won't survive any more against the numbers.We're numb now from dealing with the Soviet Bastards.Let them take Us,Rape Us,Torture Us and Kill Us.We don't give a Shit no more.They'll be in Berlin before it is over Raping and Killing there.Tell the Fuhress She and You and all the Rest of the SS Commanders have lost the Dam War and were Insane to think You could have ever beat Stalin.We should have quit after beating the French and British.We can not beat these Numbers,there's no way in Hell and that's where were all headed for.And all of Us here,We welcome it,it cannot be no worst then this Dam land of the Russians".
