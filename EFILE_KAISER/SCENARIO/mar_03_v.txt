Message from General Fernández Silvestre's HQ:

Your maneuver was very impressive, General! El Raisuli tried to resist your attack, but he finally had to flee from the battlefield to avoid being captured. He even left one of his best horses behind! Maybe his defeat will finally convince him that he'd better see Spain as an ally not an enemy. At least, I hope that. El Raisuli's cooperation would make our tasks in Morocco much easier.

I think you deserve a rest, General. A leave would do you good and I'm sure that we won't have much enemy activity for some time. We'll talk again once you are back. I will be glad to have you by my side in future operations.
