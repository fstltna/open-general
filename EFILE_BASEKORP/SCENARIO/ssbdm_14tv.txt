"Ah Patchey We just lost another Gruppe.That Heavy aa to the East is killing Us,We got to take it out no matter what.Our turn now,turn on My move maybe We can get it this time".The 45th SS/BdM Gruppe wing turned,7 JU 86's in the attack.Heading down the aa was all around.A shell came through the lead plane #175 of Commander Strouse blowing the Cockpit out the plane it spiralling into a burning building."Hell the Bastards got Ida and Freidrikka,they'll pay now".JU-86 #247 went into the Hell of shells,drops it's load of eggs.Pulling out of a dive it clipped a Radio antennae on a building."What the Hell was that,somebody get us"."No Krazy,You hit that antennae You noticed on the run before.I think were alright though".SS/BdM Pilot Patchey Volgell had finally silenced the aa and the Wings of the SS Air Korps now had a much easier time making their bomb runs and quit the stupid dives ordered by Commander Ida Strouse,now deceased.Paris was ablaze and the French Armies were on the run and being hounded by the SS Air Korps and Panzers of Gruppe 'Nohrfrau.There would still be fighting in and around the City for another two weeks and snipers of the French would be active for nearly a month after.The citizens of 'Pari would get well aquainted with the Eradication units a few months later.Too many People in dire health and all would meet a fate as others not of value to the Fuhress had.ILse would also order the Effiel Tower destroyed, "a worthless monument to glorify the French".
