OPERATION HUSKY
July 10th, 1943

With the defeat of the Afrika Korps and their Italian allies in Tunisia, we can now prepare for our return to Europe.  It has been concluded that an invasion of France is out of our reach at the present time, and thusly our focus is on Italy.  To begin with we will need to secure the island of Sicily, which will allow us to advance across the straits of Messinna into Italy itself.  The Italian defenders on the island have reportedly low morale and are considered inadequate to defend the coastline, however they have been reinforced by several German divisions.  Your main objective is the port of Syracuse.
