Your utter lack of initiative has cost the lives of countless marines.  Your inability to coordinate the fire of the fleet with troop movements on the ground has resulted in numerous casualties to firendly fire.  Perhaps wanton waste of men is the status quo on other fronts in this war, but the Kavkaz Front cannot afford a commander such as you among its ranks.  You have been relieved, Gospodin General.
