07. REVAL (10 October 1940)

TO: Vizeadmiral
SUBJECT: Reval

---As the Army further advances to Leningrad, the more bases of the Soviet Baltic Fleet become in German hands. The last major Soviet port before the Baltic Fleet's home port of Kronstadt near Leningrad, is Reval, or Tallin in Estonian. 

The Army has encircled Reval but the Soviet Army and Navy are executing a major evacuation. Many ships are busy taking on troops to evacuate them to Leningrad. We cannot allow this to happen. Your flotilla must steam up and prevent a full scale evacuation. Meanwhile the Army's divisions will close in towards Reval to take the city by land. Your Marines must support them. Watch out for the Soviet Baltic Sea: it has many ships in the area to evacuate troops, however a considerable of them are small, merchant ships capturing from the navies of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in 1940.---
