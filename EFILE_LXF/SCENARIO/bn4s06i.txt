
LAKE KASTORIA - 15 APR 1941

Lake Kastoria, West Macedonia

As expected, the Germans invaded our country in support of their unsuccessful allies, the Italians. Our East Macedonia Army capitulated already, our forces in Western Macedonia are destroyed and the Germans are close to Kozani. Thus our main forces in Albania threatens to cut off! We have no other choice but to immediate withdrawal from Albania. Advance with your troops immediately to Lake Kastoria and save our line of retreat!

GOAL: Retreat 6 ground units via Exit Point or hold after the ninth turn 4 VHs for BV! Hold after the ninth turn 3 VHs or 2 VHs for V or TV!

STORY: As the invading Germans advanced deep into Greek territory, the Hellenic Army Section of Epirus operating in Albania was reluctant to retreat. General Wilson described this unwillingness as "the fetishistic doctrine that not a yard of ground should be yielded to the Italians." It was not until 13 April that the first Greek elements began to withdraw toward the Pindus mountains. The Allies' retreat to Thermopylae uncovered a route across the Pindus mountains by which the Germans might flank the Hellenic army in a rearguard action. An elite SS formation - the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler brigade - was assigned the mission of cutting off the Greek Epirus Army's line of retreat from Albania by driving westward to the Metsovon pass and from there to Ioannina. On 14 April, heavy fighting took place at Kleisoura pass, where the Germans blocked the Greek withdrawal. The withdrawal extended across the entire Albanian front, with the Italians in hesitant pursuit. The Germans continued their advance, attacking elements of 13th division the next day, 15 April, in the Battle of Lake Kastoria.

General Papagos rushed Greek units to the Metsovon pass where the Germans were expected to attack. On 18 April a pitched battle between several Greek units and the LSSAH brigade - which had by then reached Grevena - erupted. The Greek units lacked the equipment necessary to fight against a motorised unit and were soon encircled and overwhelmed. The Germans advanced further and on 19 April captured Ioannina, the final supply route of the Greek Epirus Army.

On 20 April, the commander of Greek forces in Albania - General Georgios Tsolakoglou - accepted the hopelessness of the situation and offered to surrender his army, which then consisted of fourteen divisions.
