Convoy Battle

Hello, Admiral!

Winston Churchill himself has decided to send the New Zealand 1st division through the Mediterranean to Egypt. He knows it is an extremely dangerous enterprise, but there is no other way to defeat Rommel.

So try to get at least over 50% of our transport ships through the narrow passage between the Italian outpost and our own one. Transports may be damaged; the main point is they reach their destination at all! 

Own forces: 
We are supported by a US Navy CVE and a Free French destroyer flotilla (may arrive later).
Of course you should send some reinforcements from our naval base to the convoy - but don't leave our outpost unprotected!

Hostile forces:
The Italians are massively supported by the Jerries, particularly some wolfpacks!
Even worse; additionally to all those naval forces our convoy may be threatened from the air!

Good luck, Admiral - you will need it!                                                              
======================================
Buongiorno, ammiraglio!

Intelligence reports a major British convoy steaming in north-easterly direction.
Needless to say that you must intercept it and sink as many transports as possible!
Of course your units must defend against the escorts, but DO focus on the transports!

In order to prevent land-based support for this and upcoming convoys, you also have to occupy that British outpost in the south-east! Our first blow against their naval base will be dealt by some underwater demolition teams!

Own forces: 
We are massively supported by the Tedeschi who provide some of their famous wolfpacks and some airborne units.

Hostile forces:
The convoy escort is reported to be still weak. However, I'm afraid it will be reinforced before our navy and airforce can effectively attack it.

Buona fortuna, ammiraglio - you will need it!
