Autumn Harvest Uprising

7-9-1927, Changsha, Hunan, South-Central China.

The uprising at Guangzhou against the local warlords was successful and access by sea for Soviet aid was secured.  Now, comrade Mao from Hunan is planning an assault on the city fortress of Changsha against the local warlords and KMT troops placed at that city. The central Chinese Communist Party director dislikes this operation, but we are going to dispatch your troops there to help our comrades in the offensive.  Personally, I don't want the prestige of Mao Zedong to overly influence the ChCP.  He seems to gain more power each day.
