TO: Vizeadmiral
SUBJECT: Operation Beowulf

---Germany is once again in war with Russia - now known as the Soviet-Union. The Baltic Sea is once again a theatre where the Kriegsmarine can fully show its ability to wage war succesfully.

While the Army advances into Russia, the Kriegsmarine has been given orders to neutralize the Soviet Baltic Fleet and to support the Army's advances. Heeresgruppe Nord is advancing with great speed to Leningrad and this leaves the Estonian island archipel deeply behind our lines. You are ordered to conquer these islands lying at the entrance of the Gulf of Riga.

Your flotilla will once again be fully active. The Army has given support for the invasion. Aircraft have been assembled as well. Even the Finnish Navy has send two coastal cruisers. We doubt Soviet resistance on the islands will be heavy but beware of the Soviet flotilla near the islands.---
