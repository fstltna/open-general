   Winter '41  No place for a 'Frau !
 " Here's the report Meine Fuehress". "Well let's see,Yes this is Good.And that's alright.I can live with that move there.Frau SS General Deloris Sott,why the Hell didn't She move the 14th SS back to here,She's still vunerable to those Soviet Forces"."Meine Fuhress,the report from Her stated the Big Guns could not be moved,what motorized transport She had was breaking down trying and the horses had all done froze to death in this deplorable weather". "Yes no-one could of forseen this Weather,It has put a Damper on Our movements and the Soviet Numbers are going to make Us pay for It.Enough Breaks in the Air Cover and We should be able to hold out.Still 2 or 3 months of this and We are going to lose a lot of equipment and Frau's.A 'Necessity We must put up with.We have no choice but to give up some ground.We cannot hold positions and lose entire divisons.Things are in good order except for the 14th.Send a message to 'Sott,tell Her to sacrifice the Big Guns,pull back to Xensk.We'll move some light mobile batteries to meet up with Her".So the Soviets who could not stop the SS Frau's had an Allie that could,the Russian Winter.
