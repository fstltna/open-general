The Isonzo valley: a place to stay

Jun 23rd, 1915

Just as we feared, our Italian allies have betrayed us. Knowing that most of our army was deployed in two different fronts, they decided to stab us in the back.

I'd like to say that they'll pay for that, but the truth is that they outnumber us 2-to-1. Stopping them isn't going to be easy. At least we have some good defensive positions on the mountains. That should help.

We need you more than ever, General. If you fail, the Italians will annex Görz and Triest, and they won't stop there. Krain could fall, too, and then the gate to Österreich would be open. It could be easily the end of the Empire.


Victory conditions:
- After 14 turns you must hold 7 VHs for a BV, 6 VHs for a V and 4 VHs for a TV.

Special notes:
- A mountain brigade has beed added to your core.
- Don't forget that you can buy trucks for your light units.
