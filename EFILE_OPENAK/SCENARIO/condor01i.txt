The battle of Jarama - February 6th, 1937

Ah, Good day, Herr Oberstleutnant! Please sit down and allow me to explain the present situation. General Franco failed to take Madrid by storm last November and now request the Condor Legion - including Grupe Drohne as part of Gruppe Imker (all German ground forces in Spain) - to assist his attempt to cut off the city by crossing the Jarama to the south east and sever Madrid's communications with the Republican capital of Valencia.

ORDERS
At the end of the 18 turns, hold all 6 victory hexes for BV, 5 for V, 4 for TV. 3 or less results in  a loss. A Loss does not end the campaign.
