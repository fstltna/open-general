Xamos Huertgen Forest Version 1.07

The VIIth US corps tries to advance to the Rhine through the Huertgen Forest south of Aachen. One is confident to easily break through the available, however understaffed, Westwall fortifications. Yet the "green hell" turns out to be the graveyard for tenthousands of American GIs and German grenadeers. 
The focal point of the Huertgen Forest battle is the assault of the reinforced 28th US infantry in the area of Vossenack and Schmidt, also known as "All Souls' Day battle". After only 7 days the few leftovers of the 28th are detached from the front. Can you achieve better success?
