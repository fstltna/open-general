Good work, General. Your forces were the first to arrive in Nicosia, despite heavy British resistance at the beachheads. The Germans and Italians arrived several hours later! You landed, defeated the British and rushed north and west to capture your targets. All of Cyprus has been captured and our supplylines are safe once again. Well done.
