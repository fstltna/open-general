Drive on Alexandria
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Our objective is Alexandria, the great port of Egypt.  With Alexandria in our possession supply will cease to be a problem.  The British are present in great strength and strongly entrenched, but your past performance indicates that you should be able to overcome them.  They will be supported by the remnants of the British armor, and resupplied British aviation.  Our intelligence report that the Russians are planning a major offensive in the Kursk region so you must achieve your objectives quickly as we might need you elsewhere after we have dealt a final blow to the British.
