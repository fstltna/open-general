Final Collapse In Pomerania (30 Apr 1945)
Fourth part of the "Defending The Reich" minicampaign.

STRATEGIC SITUATION:
With the final war days approaching, and the definite loss inevitable, there's no strategy left. Germans are frantically holding the East Front to allow as many refugees to get into safety, and most of what can be achieved is simply a delay of few hours or days, before being overran by Soviets. 

TACTICAL ORDERS:
You are in a vacuum between the retreating Germans and attacking Soviets. With no orders from above, with nothing to gain, and with little hope in sight, you follow the general retreat. Joined by some infantrymen, similarly forlorn, but similarly determined to not give up easily, your only chance is to escape westwards.

RECONNAISSANCE:
Soviet guard's rifle division is moving in from the south. Infatrymen advance cautiously to avoid ambush, with tanks and SPATs following in their wake. Sky is filled with Soviet airplanes, and there's not a single Luftwaffe machine to oppose them. Enemy rear is firmly held, and there's no other chance than to break through, escape the noose of the approaching Soviet troops, and reach the British lines to avoid Siberia or worse.

NOTE:
Rush westwards, but use terrain and reconnassance wisely. You must not run into the enemy, but rather create traps for the Soviets to fall into.

VICTORY CONDITIONS:
Retreat eight units or at the end of the 16th turn or hold the required number of Victory Hexes to claim the corresponding victory.
