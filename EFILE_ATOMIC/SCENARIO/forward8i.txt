Closing the pocket
After your success at Tula we could also break through the German lines north of Moscow. You are now in the near of Smolensk. The Germans had not tried to escape. I believe they have the order to stay in the pocket. Your troops should now deploy northeast and southeast of the city and attacking the last German troops which hold the last position, in which German troops could escape. Close the pocket! Hold in any case the connection to the troops east of you (both victory hexes), so the Germans could not escape. Otherwise there is a risk that your troops will be encircled. 
Your troops:
We can provide only a few troops for your mission, because most of the soviet armies are needed to hold the pocket closed.
Enemy troops:
The Germans have left the city and have taken positions east of the town. The Germans in this area are really weak. However, the area of the bottleneck is surrounded with mine field and other blockings. We have reliable information that the Germans do big troop movements. They have removed troops from the Heeresgruppe Süd and Heeresgruppe Nord to relieve the pocket. Moreover, troops in the pocket try to meet these troops halfway. Be fast, because the enemy is outnumbered.
