Karfreit- November, 1917 - L

We tried really hard, but the Italian defences resisted. Your advance was minimal, and now that fresh enemy divisions are reinforcing their comrades, I’m afraid that we’ll have to retire to our starting positions.

Our plan was ambitious, but your execution was poor and unimaginative. Nothing has changed at the Alpine Front, and we’ve wasted lots of men, resources, and time. Soon, the Americans will be ready to fight in France, and we’ve achieved nothing in Italy. Nothing. We need some changes, herr Oberst. New commanders who can respond efficiently to these new challenges. Please resign and give way to them.
