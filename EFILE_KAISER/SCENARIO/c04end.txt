Do not apologize, comrade.  Although you were held up near Rovno, the advance is still under way.  Not even the people's army can win every skirmish.  But the war, comrade, the war is still going on, and it is going in our favor!

I have received more good news.  Comrade Tukhachevsky has started a grand offensive in Belarus and is also moving west!  Capitalist Poland will suffer dearly for their attack on the people of Russia!
