Gospodin General-Leitenant, facing entrenchments up to 9 layers deep, Linsingen's German regiments filled the outermost trenches to the brim with their dead, achieving little gain in the face of our murderous artillery.  Hofmann's second echelon -- the 1st Infantry Division (veterans of the Tannenberg campaign) -- were forced to deploy early, denying the Austro-German offensive any promise of a strategic success in this battle.  As the 4th Rifle Brigade fell upon the enemy's ranks, some retribution for our losses in far-away Prussia was exacted.

With the passing of February, the threat of an Austrian breakthrough waned, leaving Przemysl to its fate:  on March 30th the garrison capitulated.  This freed our 11th Army to redepoy to the mountains.  The fighting in April solidified along the established lines, with the Russians now failing in the face of firm Austro-German resistance.
