Battle of the Somme,  Flers-Courcelette - September 15th 1916

Two and a half months ago, British and French troops started their Somme Offensive to take the pressure off Verdun. At the same time, the Russians started the Brusilov Offensive.

Many of our divisions have been moved from the Verdun sector to the Somme, stopping the Entente attacks with heavy - specifically British - losses. But the Brits don't give up. After they captured our first line of defence, enemy activity has been noticed near Flers. Strengthen the defences and make sure the enemy does not break through our third line of defence.

Player orders: Hold all 3 victory hexes at the end of the scenario for brilliant victory, 2 for victory, 1 for tactical victory and 0 for loss.
