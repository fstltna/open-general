Vorstoss in den Kaukasus - Wehrmacht Equiptment

After taking the city of Rostov in July 1942, List's Army Group 'A' turned South in order to seize the Russian ports on the Black Sea and to capture the vital oilfields in the Caucasus. The initial German advance seemed unstoppable and within only a few days, lead elements of the German Army reached the Kuban River. Hastily, the retreating Red Army blew up the bridges and took defensive positions behind the Kuban.

The German objective is to cross the Kuban, secure key cities of enemy resistance, and quickly capture the vital oilfields.
The Russian objective is to defend the mountain passes at all cost, and await the opportunity for a massive counter attack.
