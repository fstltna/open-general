Herr General,

Your 22nd Pz has suceeded, but the 21st Pz has failed, the allies now have an uninterrupted bridgehead from Isigny to the Orne. It is quite clear they had hoped to have Cherbourg as a harbour, but your bold actions have prevented that. However, there is no chance whatsoever that we can drive hem back into the sea now.

It would be best to retreat across the Seine, but the Fuehrer has ordered that we have to take a stand here as long as possible.
