We didn't have much time to enjoy this new victory. We rested for less than one day, and then we had to board several trains that took us to the south. Denikin's staff had contacted Kolchak's, asking for a joint operation against Saratov. Kolchak had accepted, and had assigned that mission to us. We had to return to the Volga as soon as we could.

We left knowing that, without Vyatka, the Bolsheviks would not be able to defend Nizhni Novgorod and the roads that led to Arkhangelsk, which was occupied by our British allies. The distances that the Siberians would have to cover to get there were really long, so the marches would be very hard, especially in winter. However, I was sure that sooner or later they'd do it.
