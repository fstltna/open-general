The First World War - Chunuk Bair - August 1915 - Loss

Général, I guess this offensive has been doomed right from the start. Nothing went as planned, and our losses have been outrageous. All we can do now is cling to the few miles of soil that we could conquer and wait what HQ wil make out of this mess. I just received a message about the British landing at Suvla Bay. It has be an utter failure as well. What a disgrace! I can only hope that our military leaders are still sane enough to end this operation once and for all and evacuate us from this godforsaken shore.


HISTORICAL EVENTS:

Historically, the French didn't join the ANZAC troops at Chunuk Bair. They remained at Cape Helles and took part in a diversionary attack on Krithia that can be at best be described as "insignificant". Meanwhile, wave after wave of ANZAC soldiers branded against the Turkish defences along the Sari Bair range. Some Australian battalions were almost annihilated at Lone Pine and The Nek, as was the Wellington Battalion of the New Zealand Brigade, which conquered the heights of Chunuk Bair. When Mustafa Kemal launched his counter-attack on August 10th, the allied troops finally were overwhelmed, and even the brave and stubborn Gurkhas that were the last to hold out on the upper ridge, were forced to retreat.
