The XIX century is ending, and the United States of America has become one of the wealthiest countries in the world. This growing prosperity implies playing an increasingly important role in the international sphere. America has interests almost everywhere, and sometimes those interests can't be defended efficiently by peaceful means. When that happens, the small but highly motivated American Army must intervene. One way or another, the US will earn its rightful place among the greatest world powers.

From the island of Cuba to the exotic China, from the Philippine jungles to Mexico and the devastated French battlefields of the WWI, lead the American Army in this quest towards glory. Thanks to your effort, one day your country will be the most powerful in the world.
