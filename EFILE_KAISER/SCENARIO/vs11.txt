On to Paris or Observation of Antwerp - August 20th 1914

With the Belgian army retreating to Antwerp, Von Kluck's 1st Armee is now able to turn South in the direction of Paris. IIReserve Korps is left behind to protect our supply lines from further Belgian interference. 

You get the choice between:
- Keeping command of the 4th Kavalerie Division in von der Marwitz's [IIHKK], covering the flank of 1st Armee. Move [IIHKK] South to capture Mons in turn two, three or four.
- Taking command of 6.Reserve Division in von Beseler's IIReserve Korps. Move [IIR] towards Antwerp in turn one.
