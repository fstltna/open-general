Pskov
May 25, 1919

Kindralmajor, the Soomusrongide Diviis has concentrated outside of Pskov.  The capture of this city and its viscinity will be the first major co-operative operation with General Yudenich's White Russian forces.

Intelligence reports that the 10th Rifle Division has fortified at Pskov and will not be dislodged easily.  An armored train has also been spotted on the railway between Pskov and Novgorod.

You must allocate sufficient rapid forces for a second wing of your attack group to maneuver behind the Pskov garrison and to capture vital communication centers in the area.  To the south, the Bolsheviks have hastened to assemble a front out of regiments of the 4th Rifle Division.  Your break-through forces must exploit this weakness and capture all objectives quickly.  Speed is of essence!

We expect the deployment of Yudenich's troops from day to day;  however, we cannot delay the start of this operation.
