Novorossiysk is ours. Soon the first ships with supplies and reinforcement troops will arrive. I've been told that General Wrangel will be among them.
This town will be a good place for our families. Katya has decided that she'll travel here in January, so the family will be together again. Those news are almost better than my victory over the Reds.

The Reds. They've got good reasons to be worried. Most of the Taman Army Group has been destroyed or is trapped between the hills and the sea. In the next weeks we'll clean this area. The Bolsheviks will face surrender or extermination. It'll be a great blow for the Red Army of the Northern Caucasus. But not the last one. Denikin has informed me that the remaining Communist soldiers are heading south, to Armavir and Stavropol.
