Tartu
December 20, 1918

Kolonel, Brigaadikindral Kubbo welcomes you to his staff of the 1st brigade.  You are already familiar with the area:  just last month you trained your troops nearby on the shores of Lake Peipus...

The 1st brigade has been formed to combine all forces defending Tartu.  These include the 2nd and 3rd regiments and the Bulak-Bulakhovich brigade of the White Russian North Corps (which has been retreating from Pskov).  Due to a Bolshevik-orchestrated coup at Tartu, a batallion from the 2nd regiment has scattered, and Kubbo withdrew his forces toward Vortsjarv.

Your troops will join the 1st brigade in a counter-offensive aimed at recapturing Tartu and at stopping the Red Latvians at this frontier.  Beware of roadblocks that Soviet partisans have set up on the approaches to Tartu!  You will receive as reinforcement what little reserves the brigade posesses within days.

NOTE: although the Red Army sent a single (49th Red Latvian) regiment to capture Tartu, the numbers of the opposing forces were evenly matched.  This is due to wildly varying organization of troops for both sides at the time.
