Commander, you are unbelievable. Your men bothered the Nuns so badly, they have complained to everybody from Ike to the Pope. The church was turned into a gambling casino and some of your men built a still at the Juice bar!  Well, we hope that after the fun and games your men  will be ready for some actual combat with the enemy. We have a real tough one in mind for you this time.
