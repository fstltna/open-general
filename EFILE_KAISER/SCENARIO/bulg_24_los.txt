Although you did your best, this time victory was impossible. The French and Serbian armies are marching through all of Macedonia, and soon they'll be able to take Sofiya. We'll have to ask for an armistice.
I'm afraid that peace conditions will be very hard. We'll lose Macedonia and Southern Dobrudzha again, and Greece will probably take Western Thrace from us, too. We'll have to accommodate thousands of Bulgarian refugees from our lost territories, and pay huge war reparations to Serbia, Romania and Greece. Finally, Tsar Ferdinand I will have to abdicate in favour of his son Boris.
But the worst consequence of war will be the social unrest. Our people are hungry, and post-war will be terrible for them. I fear that communist revolutionaries will take advantage of this and will try to seize power.
