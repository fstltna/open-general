Bzura Counterattack

Urgent message from the 8. Armee HQ;

ACHTUNG!, the advance onwards to Warsaw must stop!, Units from the 30 Infanterie Division which were patroling the area have been completely surrounded by a large number of Polish forces which crossed the Bzura from the North.

Infanterie Divisions 17, 24, 213, and the 23 Panzer regiment will arrive in the next 24 hours to stop the Polish attack, and restablish the lines.
