08. MURMANSK (10 October 1941)

TO: Konteradmiral
SUBJECT: Advance on Murmansk

---Our concentration of the naval war effort against the Soviet Fleets has shifted from the Baltic to the Arctic Sea. The Army lays siege on Leningrad and the Baltic Fleet has safely been locked up at its home base of Kronstadt. In the Artic Sea we face a smaller Soviet Arctic Fleet. Most of its ships are even located at ports far away of the Army's front lines. 

The Army has its "Norwegen" Army deployed to capture Murmansk. Its advance has been stopped at the Litsa River. To consolidate this advance, while waiting for reinforcements, the Kriegsmarine will support a combined German-Finnish advance to capture an important peninsula. Beware of the rugged terrain of the peninsula. Your Marines will have to march across rough terrain for kilometers!

We do not expect an intervention of the Soviet Arctic Fleet so concentrate the guns of your ships to the Soviet positions instead. However your flotilla is in danger if it stays too long at the same place so the operation has to be executed with speed. After all the Arctic Fleet is a fordimable opponent if it steams out of its ports.---
