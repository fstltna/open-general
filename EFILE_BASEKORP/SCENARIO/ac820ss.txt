Come in General......close the door quickly!

The Russian cold winter still brings back memories of last year, does it not?

Our 6th Army is trapped in Stalingrad from another Soviet winter offensive.  Good news though, Manstein has already started an attack to open a corridor with 4th Panzer Army and our forces will attack here in a supporting effort.

The Russians are strung out, now is opportune to defeat them in detail.  I know you and your men are still getting used to this area, but be thankful the winter is not so harsh this far south.

STAFF INTEL: The Russian front lines are thin but have good troops.  In addition several Tank and Mech formations are in close reserve posing a considerable threat.
