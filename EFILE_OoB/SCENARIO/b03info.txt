03. TSIMBA RIDGE (21 January 1945)

From our forward base at Puto, you have been ordered to advance further north and take a hilly ridge known as Tsimba Ridge. Patrols have shown prepared Japanese positions so you might be in for a tough battle. Air support will be given. You must force your way through the central part of Tsimba Ridge and reach the Genga River! Good luck, General.
