Excellent. I think you'll be the first to arrive at the Kremlin!

Unfortunately the rest of the front isn't advancing as fast as you, and if we keep meeting the same level of resistance we might have to go to plan B.
High Command is adamant fighting has to be over before winter comes.

In the meantime, keep rushing forwards! We need to reach Moscow by summer!
