Barbarossa

Godday, general!

the "Fuehrer" was forced to decide on an attack on the Soviets.
With operation 'Barbarossa' we'll preempt an imminent sneak attack of the Bolshevists.

In this section of army group South you again can implement your proven Blitzkrieg tactics. 
Destroy the red air force early and use your motorized and Panzer divisions to quickly push into the Russian hinterland.

There is, however, one special point: 
It is essential to eliminate the Russian listening post in the mountains.
To that end a Romanian mountain division will join your corps, which is not advisable to waste on hot encounters near the front.

Of course, our own key positions (vic hexes) must be held!
-----------------------------------
Tovarishtsh General!
I just returned from Moscow, which is buzzing with weird rumors of a Fashist attack. Just like comrade Stalin I do not believe this.
After all, they can't afford a war on two fronts, and depend on our supply of raw materials.

Therefore no special action is required.
Quietly continue with the training of your border- and rapid deployment troops. Quite possibly the day will come when we can use experienced worker- and peasant soldiers to spread the blessings of bolshevism into other societies.
