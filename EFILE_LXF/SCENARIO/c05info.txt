05. PILSEN (20 November)

Prague has fallen. Moravia and Bohemia are largely ours and the Czechs still there are isolated in large and small Kessels. Slovakia remains beyond our control yet but the Slovakian nationalistic leaders are trying to contact us, perhaps they are ready to co-operate with us against the Czechs. 

One of those major Kessels in the one around Pilsen (or Plzen as the Czechs call it). Elements of 10th and 12th Army are trying to mop this Kessel up from the German-Czech border. Your force must attack from the direction of Prague. Your forces must join 10th and 12th Armies' and mop up the Kessel.

Your forward elements have captured the single heavy bridge over the Uhlava River. The Czechs are likely to counterattack and destroy the bridge and disrupt your attack. You must be quick and exploit the current situation and mop up the Kessel and capturing Pilsen.
