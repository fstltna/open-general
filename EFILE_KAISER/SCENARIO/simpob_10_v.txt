As we paraded in front of the Kazan Kremlin, I realised that the spring of 1919 would probably be the happiest of my life. We were recovering our homeland step by step. Siberia and the Urals were safe, and now it was time to consolidate our positions on the Volga.

A few days later we received excellent news from southern Russia. Denikin's forces had finally been able to advance into the lower Volga, and had taken Tsaritsyn. That meant that our two armies were separated by less than 150 Russian miles. If we managed to liberate Samara and Saratov, the two main clusters of anti-Bolshevik resistance would finally be united. Kolchak knew the importance of that goal, so he ordered us to plan a summer offensive against Samara.
