Battle of Loos - Hohenzollern Redoubt - September 25th 1915

After taking part in the attacks on Ypres, you are back in command of [VII] Korps. It's troops are still occupying the same sector of the front (13th Infantry Division around Neuve Chapelle, 14th Infantry Division South of it and the 6th Bavarian Reserve Division in reserve). 

British troops in your sector have just started their expected autumn offensive. The attacks seem to be concentrated around the main defensive position: the Hohenzollern Redoubt. Contain the British gains and use reinforcements to counterattack. 'The Dump', the slag heap near Fosse 8 (Mine Pit 8), offers excellent views on the enemy positions. 

Player orders: Hold all 6 victory hexes at the end of the scenario for brilliant victory, 4 or 5 for victory, 2 or 3 for tactical victory and 0 or 1 for loss.
