
PORT SAID - 18 MAY 1941

West of Port Said, Egypt

Our main target in North Africa, the Suez Canal is in range! With this strategic point in our hands, Gibraltar too, Malta and Cyprus loyal to the new British king, our main objectives in the Mediterranean are achieved. However, you must act quickly, agents report that the enemy prepare the scuttling of merchant ships to make the canal for a long time impassable. It can be assumed that the Commonwealth troops will defend Port Said - a French Brigade and parts of a Indian Division staying in this area.

GOAL: Take all Axis VH's and occupy and hold the Canal entrance (Canal port VH) at Port Said until the 10th turn, otherwise you lose!

NOTE: All axis nations auxiliaries are under your command. Keep some money to build an airfield!
