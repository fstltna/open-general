Stalluponen, 17th August, 1914

Gospodin General-Major, your division is now part of General Epanchin's III Corps, of the 1st Army (Rennenkampf).  With great speed, we have mobilized and concentrated our front-line divisions for an attack against Germany - surpassing the enemy's estimate by 4 weeks.  The opening engagement of the war is at Stalluponen, a town just inside German Eastern Prussia.

Your orders are to swiftly capture your objective and clear the way for the army's advance toward Koenigsberg.
