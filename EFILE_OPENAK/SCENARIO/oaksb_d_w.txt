Windsor

September 1, 1940

	Assuming the German forces could get across the English Channel, the Germans would have to isolate London from the British interior by taking control of the territory near Windsor.  The British could be expected to pour every possible reinforcement into the battle for London.

Note:  There is a leader available in the central city of Egham.  You will want to take the city with a unit that has no leader if you want to take advantage of this.
