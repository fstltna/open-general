Enhorabuena General!

Your brilliant defence of the island has made fail the yankee attempt to conquer a part of the Spanish Empire.

You should run back to the Phillipines where a new mission is waiting for you.

Historical background:

The American forces reached Guam on the morning of June 20, 1898. The protected cruiser USS Charleston shelled fort Santa Cruz but there was no response. The fort did not reply not only because it had no powder but also because the Spanish government did not notify that Spain had been in war with the United States for nearly two months.
 
Spain had made no effort to reinforce this remote post of its empire. Spanish garrison on the island consisted only of 54 Spanish soldiers and 54 native "Chamorros". The rumors that there was a Spanish gunboat at Guam were not correct, it was only the Japanese vessel Minatogawa, trading in copra. The US determined afterwords that the fort were of no military value and that the old cast iron guns were even unsafe for saluting purposes.

Being unable to resist US superior force (a heavily armed vessel and several transports loaded with troops), the Spanish Governor of Guam surrendered the island.

On June 22, 1898, the USS Charleston and the transports left Guam to continue on their way to Manila. 

The bloodless capture of the island of Guam gave the United States its first Spanish possession in the Pacific.
