Hs 293 was a German radio controlled anti-ship guided missile (actually a glide bomb with a rocket engine slung underneath it).
Unlike the Fritz X, the Hs 293 was intended to destroy unarmoured ships.
Much like the Fritz X, its length of almost 4 m and its weight of around one ton made that only bigger planes could deploy them, and even then only one at a time.
