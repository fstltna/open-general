The Hungarian word literally means “National Guard on Horse”.

It is a Militia Reconnaicanse Cavalry with weak attack and defense values, but it is faster than other Cavalry Recons. It has no special skill.

After the success of the revolution in March 1848, the Parliament and the king accepted and announced the “April Laws”, which became the first modern constitution of Hungary. It guaranteed almost a complete independence within a loose personal union with the Austrian Empire, but there were some unsolved questions, like the Hungarian Army responsible only to the Government, as the Hungarians demanded. Until this issue was arranged, the Government wanted some sort of armed forces, which could be used against the Serbian uprising in the southern regions (Bánát).

The National Guard was raised in April 1848. Very few of the Nemzetõrs (less than 5,000) were mounted, but there were two notable battallions consisting of former betyárs (outlaws, bandits) who pledged themselves to the revolution. These battallions didn’t participate in classic battles but fought successful guerilla warfare behind the Austrian lines.
