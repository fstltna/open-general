General Vittorio Ambrosio

General, your defeat  has consequences! In Italy unrests broke out, the industry is weakened and the military situation is precarious. An armistice with the Allies is the best solution! But the Italian Nation will always keep your heroic acts in memory.

Thanks for playing, hope you enjoyed the campaign!
