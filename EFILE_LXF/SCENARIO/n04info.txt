PUSAN PERIMETER 2 (30 August 1950)

Are you ready, Comrade General?  Good.  We expected nothing less.  We have increased your People's Army's strength as best we could.  Almost 100,000 eager troops are under your command.  Even some new T-34 tanks have been brought forward.  You will lead them in our liberation of the Pusan Perimeter!

The plan has not changed.  We will attack along the entire front and break the enemy line.  I will de-brief you in Pusan!
