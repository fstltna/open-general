We expected more of you, General. The British control the Hohenzollern Redoute, and we'll need many counterattacks, and the loss of many soldiers, to take it back.
Consider this battle as a warning. Eventually the enemy will find the way to surprise us. We must act before that happens, but what can we do? We have numerical inferiority and the front line is too long. For us, attempting a breakthrough is out of the question. The OHL is thinking about a possible solution, and maybe next year we'll know their decision. Whatever that decision is, when the moment comes you'll have to behave as a true German officer. Mediocrity won't be tolerated.
