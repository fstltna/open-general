....the senate requires from Caesar to return his command and to disband the ten legions being subordinated to him!
The political opponents of Caesar intrigue together with the followers of the Pompey to destroy Caesar!

The honour of Caesar can never admit this!

Long-standing followers like Titus Labienus have already deserted to the enemy! But Caesar can still count on loyal friends! In front of the whole army Caesar wants to praise the Legate of the Legio V !: 
"Companions! Fellow citizen! The senate has betrayed us, but I will lead you further to the victory!. . . "

Caesar is going to cross the Rubicon with his experienced legions!
