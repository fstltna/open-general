<THE PESTILENCE HAS NEARLY BEEN WIPED OFF OF OUR WORLD.   BUT THE TWO STRONGEST SPECIES HAVE PUT THEIR DIFFERENCES ASIDE AND HAVE GATHERED IN THE COLD WASTELAND OF THE NORTH, WHERE THEY EVEN NOW WORK WITH THEIR PECULIAR ADAPTABILITY ON A WAY TO STOP US.>

<DESTRUCTION OF THIS HIVE CLUSTER WILL ASSURE OUR FINAL VICTORY, BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL OBSTACLES IN OUR WAY.>

<BIPED FORCES HAVE SEEN US COMING AND BLOCKED OFF THE MAJOR ARTERIAL INTO THIS REGION WITH AN AVALANCHE OF BOULDERS AND AN EXCELLENT DEFENSIVE POSITION.  THE PATH TO THE EAST MUST BE SECURED FROM THIS ANGLE IN ORDER TO BRING IN THE MAIN WARRIOR GROUP.>

<THE BITTER COLD ALSO WEAKENS THE WARRIORS THAT REMAIN UNDER OUR COMMAND IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA.  IF ACTION IS NOT TAKEN QUICKLY, UNIT COHESIVENESS WILL QUICKLY COLLAPSE TO WEATHER CONDITIONS.>

<MOVE WITH HASTE. MOVE WITH PURPOSE.>

*Consider replacing your auxiliary forces.
*Auxiliary forces will slowly die out from frostbite, so be quick.
*Use the ants' mountain movement to your advantage.
