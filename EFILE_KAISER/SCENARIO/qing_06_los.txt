The Japanese invasion of Manchuria and the loss of Liushun weren't the last disasters for China in this war. Weihawei, Penghu and Taiwan were terrible blows, too. Our troops fought as well as they could, but it wasn't enough. Chinese reforms had been too slow, and despite all our efforts the Qing Army simply wasn't ready for a modern war. Not yet.

Peace negotiations started in March, and on 17 April 1895 both countries signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki. The Qing Empire was forced to accept a Japanese protectorate over Korea, lost Taiwan, Penghu and the Manchurian Liaodong Peninsula, and had to pay war reparations to Japan. The peace terms were so harsh, in fact, that Russia, France and Germany, fearing that the Japanese could become too powerful, forced Japan to give up the Liaodong Peninsula, which eventually ended under Russian control.

The terms of the treaty were devastating for the Chinese pride. Sorrow and resentment against foreigners, especially Westerners and Japanese, spread incredibly fast in all the country. Millions of voices cried for revenge, for the expulsion of the "white devils" and for the end of the foreign concessions. The Chinese government, which secretly supported those claims, did nothing to control the protesters, and as the century came to and end it was obvious that a new war would start soon. All that we could do was to go on with the modernization of the Chinese Army, and pray for being ready when the Empire needed us.
