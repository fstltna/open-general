General, despite your heroic efforts in these rearguard actions, the KuK troops are retreating without any order, complete regiments are deserting.

And not only has the Italian front collapsed, but also the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy has ceased to exist. All across the former empire, the various territories are declaring their independence. Protesters have gained control of Budapest, and King Charles IV has accepted the independence of Hungary. It's time to return to our homeland. I know your troops are demoralized, exhausted and eager for peace, but I'm afraid that Serbian, Romanian and Czech territorial demands have no limits, and we will face a new war sooner than we think...


Thanks for playing the campaign!
