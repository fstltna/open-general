Forgotten War

The Wehrmacht has broken through the borders and is advancing towards Warsaw. The Soviets break the nonaggression pact and attack the Polish eastern areas. The Polish army is in a hopeless situation. But perhaps there is a last chance? Perhaps the western allies will fulfill their obligations? Perhaps not everything is lost yet?
