Jasin

Although the German victory at Tanga had thwarted the British plans for a quick victory over German East Africa, Indian and K.A.R. troops managed to control some strategic positions on the German East African side of the border with British East Africa.  One of these positions was the Jasin plantation.  Von Lettow-Vorbeck knew that Jasin was weakly defended and decided to attack on 18 January 1915 in order to prevent further danger to Tanga.
