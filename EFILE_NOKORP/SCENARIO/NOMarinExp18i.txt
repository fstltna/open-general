Everything went so well High Command is considering attacking the main US base in the Pacific, Pearl Harbor. The Japanese have already bombed it some years ago, High Command is convinced you can do better, Feldmarschall.

A solid Japanese foothold on Hawai will put the US in danger and make sure they won't have neither the resources nor the time to bother us.

Unfortunately you're so far from Germany we can't send you any reinforcements, but the Japanese are sending troops to help. We don't know what they are worth, but they sure are motivated.


Instructions: Capture all VHs.
