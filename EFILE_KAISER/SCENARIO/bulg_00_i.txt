The Balkan War - Battle of Lozengrad

October 22th, 1912

Good morning, General. It seems that our alliance with the Serbs and the Greeks will make our old dream of liberating all the Bulgarian people that are still under the Turkish yoke come true. Our advance on Thrace has been so quick that we have caught the Turks off-guard. So far, they have only a few weak divisions in the area, and their reinforcements haven't been able to arrive in time.
However, our intelligence reports suggest that the enemy could try an enveloping manouver here, at our Third Army's left flank. Your mission is to crush any counterattack from the Turks and follow our advance to the town of Lozengrad.

Victory conditions: Take all VHs.
