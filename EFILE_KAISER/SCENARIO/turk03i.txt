Trenches at Janzour - June 8, 1912

We have been able to keep the Italians confined to the coastal cities for more than half a year now. But the enemy has received reinforcements and is trying to occupy more of Trablusgarp. Here near Trablus, they are about to attack the trench lines that we have been building at Janzour - 20 km to the West of the city.

Orders: 
- Do not at any time let the Italians take all three victory hexes. 
- Do not let them kill your command unit - Enver Bey. 
- At the end of the scenario, holding all three 3 victory hexes gives you a brilliant victory. Hold two for victory and one for tactical victory.

Intelligence report: Our cavalry was hidden on the left flank of the enemy, but has been spotted by Italian air ships.
