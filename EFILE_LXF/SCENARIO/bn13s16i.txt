
KUFRA - 15 FEB 1941

To coincide with the defeat of Italian forces in Libya and Egypt and the opening of an offensive in East Africa a series of attacks are made on Italian outposts in southern Libya. A major Italian outpost is Kufra, which sits on a possible supply route to Egypt. There is a large garrison at Kufra, plus a fort.

Your task is simple; attack Kufra and drive the Italians out. Despite the mistrust you have of the British, after their attack on the French navy at Oran, you have assistance of a number of British air units. French reinforcements are expected within a few days.

GOAL: Take all VH's!

IMPORTANT NOTE: The Italian defenders are on alert, so your assault will not be a surprise - expect attacks all along your line and protect your airfield.
