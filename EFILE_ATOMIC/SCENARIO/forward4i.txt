Battle of Odessa:
The Rumanian 4. Army has launched its attack on Odessa in the last days. They succeeded in pushing our troops back. Your mission is to launch a counterattack and put the Rumanians back to their starting position.
Your troops:
Again, you will nearly have your own troops to deal with your mission.
Enemy troops:
The Rumanian 4. Army is inexperienced. They have only a few tanks, but a lot of cavalry and infantry. We expect that some German troops will arrive in a few days to support the Rumanian attack.
