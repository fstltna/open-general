Our victory is complete! We have taken thousands of prisoners and  tons of Russian supplies. And in the east the enemy defences have been destroyed. In a few days we'll occupy Konstantia and all of Dobrudzha. Tsar Ferdinand is extremely pleased!
However I must inform you that, from now on, we'll decrease our level of engagement in the Romanian front. Apart from giving Southern Dobrudzha back to us, Germany and Austria-Hungary don't want to grant us any significative territorial compensations in the area, so why should we fight for nothing? Yes, we'll still launch minor operations at the Dunav Delta, and we'll flank the Germans on their final assault on Bukurest, but we won't take part in any major battles.
You deserve a rest after so much action. But don't get used to it. We'll need you soon on the Macedonian front. Things aren't going that well there. We haven't suffered any important defeat yet but, on the other hand, the French and British forces have taken the initiative since January, and we have only been able to defend our positions, without making any important advance.
