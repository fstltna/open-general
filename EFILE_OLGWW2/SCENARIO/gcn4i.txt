Bilbao Offensive

Orders from: Pamplona (Navarra) May 1936

Buenos dias General.  It is my pleasure to put you in command of the offensive at Bilbao. The newly created Brigadas Navarras are now under your direct command as well as the 2nd Italian Division that was deployed in Spain to defeat the Marxists.  A large number of artillery pieces and air recourses will support your storming the enemy lines.  I suggest you use the close support tactics of the Germans to eliminate the Republican battalions.

It's imperative you take Bilbao as soon as possible.  I know if the Vizcayan capital falls the Basque nationalist battalions will surrender.  The Republicans think they are safe behind those bunkers around Bilbao, the ''Cinturon de Hierro'', but that's just a myth!  The engineer who designed the fortified line, Alejandro Goicoechea, is now on our side. Thanks to him, we have all the blueprints of the bunkers.  Only about 40 percent of the lines were completed and the most important thing is we know where the weak points are.

Deploy your forces and begin the attack.  One more thing my General, In the near future I'm planning a personal meeting with General Franco.  We will discuss my role in the new government, so I will be gone for a couple of days.  Oh, one last thing.  Thanks to our Italian friends you can add some Italian units to your army.
