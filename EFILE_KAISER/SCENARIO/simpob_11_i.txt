Where it all began: Samara

July 14th, 1919

After securing Kazan, Simbirsk and Samara were our next obvious steps. I was confident that both cities would fall with relative ease. Unlike Kazan, their defenders had not built strong fortifications that could stop our assaults. We also knew that many Bolshevik regiments had fled to Saratov, and Kolchak had sent one cossack division to reinforce us. So I believed that nothing could stop our men.

Of course, I had heard the rumours about a surge of the partisan activity along the railroads, but to be honest, I had not paid much attention to them. After one year of war against the Red Army, the idea of worrying for a bunch of peasants with forks seemed hilarious to me.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.

Special notes:
- You can buy equipment from the Cossack Hosts in this scenario.
- Be careful with the possible partisan activity on your rear.
