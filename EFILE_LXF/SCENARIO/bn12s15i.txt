North off Viti Levu, South Pacific
CO Admiral Seiichi Ito

The attack on Fiji Islands will successfully finish Operation FS and cut off Australia and New Zealand from supplies. The Americans have stationed an infantry division on Viti Levu and the remnants of their 2nd Marine Division on Vanua Levu. Even some highly effective B-24 heavy bombers, as replacement for the unsuitable B-17 are stationed on the islands. Expect that enemy submarines and strong surface units will try to prevent your landing! Extensive reconnaissance is advisable.

BACKGROUND

New Zealand accepted responsibility for the defense of the Fiji Islands, a British Crown Colony, soon after the beginning of the war with Germany and Italy. On May 13, 1942, the United States prepared to take over the defense of Fiji under the joint Army and Navy plan for the relief of New Zealand in the Fiji Islands. At that time, New Zealand had some 10,000 troops stationed on Viti Levu, the largest of the 250 islands which make up the Fiji group. This group was an important link in the line of communications to the south and southwest Pacific areas.
