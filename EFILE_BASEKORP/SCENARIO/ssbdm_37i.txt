   "I'll believe it when I see It,My Fuhress" 
  Joseph Stalins new plan was making progress.No where better was the message delivered to the SS then at Stalingrad.Here the 6th SS 'Savannah had worked into the city but street fighting with support of heavy Soviet batteries from behind the Volga was taking its toll.Even the Mighty Tigers in the streets were being destroyed the Soviets taking out the protecting infantry with small groups of soldiers or the large caliber shells coming from across the Volga making the Heavy Panzer vunerable to magnetic mines and explosives.SS Frau General Savannah Michelle Armstack sent a message to Berlin. Stalingrad was a 'Rat War' and She would not have enough Fraus to man a Mobile Kitchen if things kept going the way they was.The only thing positive was the Rats would be fed with the Dead from both sides.Also reports showed the Soviets had actually let Her work Panzers into the area as part of an encirclement operation which they were about to commence.The Air-war over Stalingrad was not a forgone conclusion either according to Savannah,the Soviets showed up in Good numbers no matter how the Commanders of the Air Korps kept stating 'The BdM has Superiority'.So a call to SS/BdM AirFuhress Inga Stercghassmann from the Fuhress. Stalingrad would be taken care of and those Guns across the Volga would cease to be as well as any large troop concentrations. Armstack was informed,She was not impressed.Would She be?
