Allahu Akbar! Our troops are at the gates of Al Hudaydah. This seaport is next to Aden the main hub for import and export of goods in Yemen. The Yemenis have already vacated the place and are on the run. But European powers have deployed warships and occupied parts of the port to protect their trade and to demonstrate their power. Do not be intimidated and occupy Al Hudaydah! Your second task is to intercept Yemeni caravans. The Yemenis have taught the depots in Al Hudaydah and try to save his goods to Sanaa. Get the caravans and make rich booty!

GOAL: Destroy 9 of 16 enemy MSUs and let not more then 15 enemy units reach the Exit Points!

Main reinforcements:
5th turn - northwest, motorized detachment (3 units)

STORY: In May 1934, the Saudi forces pressed forward their attack in the coastal region, occupying Al Hudaydah. The Wahabi tribesmen threatened to loot the Indian trading businesses in Al Hudaydah, but were dissuaded by the arrival of British sailors to maintain order. Unrest occurred in Sanaa, due to lack of food. The Iman denied rumours that he had been slain, while his son fled. Both the King and the Imam sought control of Asir. The Imam asked King Fuad of Egypt to intervene in the war. The British sloop 'Penzance' evacuated the British and Indian residents of Al Hudaydah and 300 foreigners, to Karaman Island for safety. Britain, France, and Italy deployed warships in Al Hudaydah in opposition to the Saudi Arabian troop deployment in the region.
