These are hard times for being a farmer in the Transvaal Republic. If the British want something, they take it. And now they want your land. All right then. If they desire it so badly, they will have to pay with fire and blood.

Follow the Boer general Koos de la Rey in his campaign against the British Empire and become a hero. Fight your enemies until the bitter end and, who knows?, maybe you'll get a chance to earn your happy ending.
