General!

Our forces were swamped by the Russians hordes from the south!

Your troop's inability to screen the flanks of my Panzerkorps forced the main thrust to halt and support your flank guard efforts. True that our reconnaisance underestimated the hordes that charged against us, but your troops could have performed better!

I meet with Marshall Graziani, your replacement tomorrow.  I expect you will be professional enough to brief him fully on his new command before you return to Italy.
