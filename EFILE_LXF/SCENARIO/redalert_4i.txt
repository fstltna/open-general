I'm sure you remember the battle we fought here to open a supply route into Poland. Well, it turns out it was a big mistake to wait to attack Berlin. Soviet forces in Germany, desperate, encircled and low on supplies, have launched a counter-attack with what's left of their forces.You'll have to defend your base in this area and eventually lead a counter-attack into Berlin. Good luck.
