Situation report: Operation Exporter is moving along quite well. Despite heavy French resistance, we have managed to drive to within striking range of the port city of Beirut. This is the last large bastion of the Vichy forces. A victory here will force them to withdraw from the Middle East completely.

Operational orders: Simply put, you must take Beirut and all supporting enemy bases in the region. The French will be driven from the area and Germany will be denied any access to the Middle East that is not blocked by Allied Forces.
