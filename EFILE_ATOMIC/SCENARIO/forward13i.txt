Operation Uranus
Be ready for Operation Uranus. Today our great offensive starts with the aim to encircling the 6. Army in Stalingrad. Your troops will attack from the south and the northwest the German and their allied troops. 
Your troops:
You will have command over the 65. Army. This troops will attack the Romanian front in the northeast and will support your attack against the Italian und Hungarian troops in the southeast.
Enemy troops:
In the southwest the 4. Panzerarmee under command of Hermann Hoth is your opponent. In the north the 3. Romanian Army defends the front line. In the southeast Italian and Hungary troops hold the lines. The Romanian, Italian und Hungarian troops have under strength and are bad equipped. They have only a lit bit of ammunition. Although these troops are numerous, they should be no real opponent for your troops. The situation in the southwest looks different. The 4. Panzerarmee still has some tank divisions. There is also a tank troop equipped with the new very dangerous Tiger tank.
