1. CREDITS and CONTACT INFORMATION:

1a. Credits:
Toliy has created the equipement file. It is only efile containing the countries involved in the First World War and its immediately consequence. It is a great efile and I have met only the fullest co-operation of the Toliy, with the efile but also with other small campaign related things. Jan Hedstrom, Toliy, Dirk Oberlin, Devil’s Brigade, and Shikaka have playtested this campaign and notified me of several points that have now been improved. Dirk Doberlin has corrected all my grammar and spelling mistakes in the briefings. Steve Brown let me uses this readme template for my campaign as well. Thank you ALL!

1b. Contact information:

3. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

This readme assumes some basic knowledge of copying, moving and unzipping files in Windows and you should at least know which folder on your computer contains the program. User-made additions to Panzer General 2 are not as easy to install as the original software, but are not difficult if you read the installation instructions and use a certain amount of common sense - new maps, equipment files and other material ALL have installation instructions (some of which are included with the downloads and some of which are on the web sites). It is important to remember that while I am very happy to help with any problems - all the information you need is available, you only need to take the time to find and read it. The “Upgrade Center” on Steve Brown’s web site has the basics of upgrading - http://www.wargamer.com/pg2campaigns/steve/upgrade/pg2-uc.htm

Get the maps from the Panzergeneral2.com (http://panzergeneral2.com/cgi-bin/maps/map.pl?fn=agheila) or Steve Brown’s Clearinghouse (http://www.wargamer.com/pg2campaigns/steve/clearinghouse/pg2-mods_n_stuff-maps.htm) or www.stahlhelm.prv.pl or http://www.gilestiel.eu/MapFinder/index.php

3e. Maps, install:
If you do not know how to install user maps, follow the instructions EXACTLY from “How to use maps” at the Map Center and you should have no problems - most campaign crash problems are related to incorrect installation of the user maps;

	3f. Video and Music:
A custom video can be downloaded at the Adlerkorps web site (http://www.adlerkorps.com) - these are optional. You need a smack by Toliy called “red-army-smack-01.smk”. Installation instructions are included with the “PG2 Mods For Dummies”. See my web site (http://members.home.nl/members/pg2/index.htm) for which video you need. THESE VIDEOS ARE CALLED “SMACKS”;

3g. Patches & running French or German versions of PG2:
You MUST first patch your program to v1.02 using the official SSI patch and you MUST also be using the “unofficial” v2.10 or higher patch (the latest version at time of writing is 2.10). Look at the “Versions & Patches” section of Builders Paradise for more information and the “Clearinghouse” on Steve Brown’s site for the unofficial patch. The unofficial patches will only work for US & UK versions of PG2; but will also work with German and French versions if you use the “DEU/FRA to Text Converter“ from the “Downloads” section of Steve Brown’s web site.

3h. List of playable campaigns in PG2
This campaign will be listed as "BOLSHEVIK CAVALRY ARMY CAMPAIGN". Once you have upgraded to the ‘unofficial’ version 2.02 patch, the up and down arrows of the scroll bar now work (but not the scroll bar itself), so scroll down until you see the campaign.

That’s it ... start the campaign and enjoy!

4. REVISION HISTORY:

Version 1.00 released July 2007.

5. THE CAMPAIGN:

When the Russian Civil War broke out in 1918, a popular Cossack leader named Budyonny organized a small cavalry force in the Don region out of local Cossacks and common-place criminals.  This force rapidly grew in numbers, sided with the Bolsheviks and eventually became the Cavalry Army.  It was transformed from a guerrilla force into a proper military unit.  This Army played an important role in winning the Civil War for the Bolsheviks, driving the White General Anton Denikin back from Moscow. 

In 1920 Budyonny's Cavalry Army took part in the invasion of Poland during the Polish-Bolshevik War and at first had remarkable success.  The Cavalry Army pushed Polish forces out of the Ukraine and broke through Polish southern frontlines, but later was bogged down at Lwow.  This in turn led to the heavy defeat of the rest of the Bolsheviks forces in the Battle of Warsaw.  When the Cavalry Army finally joined the battle it was also soundly defeated in the Battle of Komarow, known as the last great cavalry battle in history.  At this point, the Cavalry Army's morale and discipline were at a low point and robbery and violence became commonplace against the civilian population. 

What remained of Cavalry Army was sent south to fight with Wrangel's White forces in Ukraine and the Crimea.

6. CAMPAIGN DEVELOPMENT NOTES, RULES and BUGS:

This campaign was playtested at 100% prestige; experienced players might try at less than 100% and new players might try it at 200 or even 300%.

In contrary to many other campaigns you will find some of the scenarios rather empty. The warfare in this campaign is open and is most scenarios perfect for large maneuver by cavalry. Sometimes large plains are barely defended and cavalry can just dush over it. Cavalry in this efile in the tank class so cavalry can overrun units too like tanks do.

Because cavalry is in the tank class in this efile, it means that infantry in villages and towns are well protected against cavalry assaults. This is historical though. To dislodge infantry from villages, use multiple attacks. Sometime the enemy will crack. On open fields, cavalry is powerful weapon.

7. HINTS & TIPS:

Unit purchasing is different in this campaign than most other campaigns. If you want to play without my purchasing advice please ignore this section. In general you should build up a strong cavalry force, with some supporting forces. Choices when playing with the equipement file with rules or without rules are different. If playing with rules, the choices are limited and the best is to go with lots of cavalry and some horse recon and horse artillery in support.

8. FINAL NOTE:

This campaign is the result of many months’ work by Dennis Felling and I consider it copyrighted. Please do not change anything on a version that you are making available to other players.
