   "The Soviets want it back Bad" 
  Another large scale attack was planned by the Ivans on Leningrad.SS/BdM Frau General Viga Nostitz decided to move first. "Rhonda,the Trupps ready". "Javolt,General.Supplied and deployed as instructed". "How's the morale of the Commom Frau"? "Good overall General but pockets of dissatisfaction are starting to show.That has to be expected with the numbers We are losing or being maimed.And of course the Soviet heavy batteries shelling 'No-Fraus' land is taking it's toll"."I told Ilse way back Her indocrination was going to really be put to the test once We moved East.You can talk all You want about Duty,Glory and Honor to the Frauland but once You are in Combat and that is sustained as the levels here in the East a lot of Fraus are gonna crack.You cannot watch those around You fall and not pay a price.Maybe after this We will get a little break,I know the Fraus need one.Hell I do too but don't imagine I myself will have that Luxury.Of course the horrendous numbers the Soviets have lost it is hard to Fathom how any of their soldiers could have any moral at all.Hopefully they 'break' soon as the Fuhress has stated.Those Commisars for Stalin cannot be Miracle Workers but I give them Credit they've worked some up to this moment. Maybe Our routing of the Soviets here will put a cease to that".
