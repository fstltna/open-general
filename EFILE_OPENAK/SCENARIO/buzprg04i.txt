Zhashkiv

Part 3/3 of the "Battles of the Brigade" minicampaign.

*****

Combat operations around Zhashkiv took a place in a boggy terrain full of mines, barbed wire and MG nests. Brigade held the positions on river Horny Tikich and around Buzivka. Czechoslovaks were ordered to stop any German attack against Zhashkiv and thus prevent their escape from Soviet encirclement.

Brigade participated in fighting since 17th January, when tanks and motorized infantry charged and destroyed a small German bridgehead near Ostrozhany, until 26th January, when Luftwaffe inadvertently destroyed the bridge at village, severely crippling any chance of German escape. Brigade was moved to its new postions on the very same day.

Intelligence and reconnaisance: In an attempt to breaktrough from the encirclement, Germans amassed a giant force. Their 16th and 17th tank divisions lead the attack, but there are plenty of other tanks, assault guns, infantrymen and cannons in reserve. The enemy has no less than one hundred tanks of many different types, including the fearful Tigers and Panthers. German airforce is also more than impressive.

Reinforces: Soviet 42nd guards division, 74th, 163rd, 232nd (794th regiment), 240th rifle divisions and the 87th tank regiment will reach our positions in a day or two.

Hint: Let the Germans crack on your defense. Don't proceed alone. Be careful of enemy reserves.
Our radio operators try to disturb and spy on the German transmission 24 hours a day. Hopefully their hard work will be of help.

Victory conditions: After twenty turns hold three VHs for a BV, two for a V and one for a TV.
