PLAYER's CHOICE FOR THE CONQUEST OF EGYPT

After your victory upon the British at El Arish, final preparations have been made to push towards the Suez Canal in Egypt. To do that we have to cross the Sinai desert which can be crossed in various ways. The General Staff is not sure whether to assault Port Said on the northern part of the Canal and take the coastal route or to assault Suez at the southern part of the Canal and take the central route. Due to your skills, you must make the choice between assaulting Port Said or Suez! 


IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS IS NO ORDINARY SCENARIO. YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE THE NEXT SCENARIO YOU WANT TO PLAY. THERE IS NO RIGHT CHOICE. BOTH ARE EQUAL IN DIFFICULTY. BOTH LEAD TO SAME SCENARIO.


CHOOSE THE NORTHERN FLAG/HEX FOR ASSAULT ON PORT SAID.

CHOOSE THE SOUTHERN FLAG/HEX FOR ASSAULT ON SUEZ.
