(February 13, 1915)

The fortress at Przemysl has been surrounded for months. The defenders are desperate and they are running out of ammo and food. I know, General, the winter in the Carpathians is harsh, but this is our last chance to relieve them. Open a path to the fortress!

ORDER: Keep your MSU alive and hold at least 2 VHs.
