Limanowa
(December 1, 1914)

After the failed San Offensive, we have had to retreat toward Kraków. The Germans can't send the promised troops to help you as they have launched a new offensive to take Lódz. We hold the fortified area of Kraków, but there is a 200 km wide gap between the 3rd and 4th KuK Armies. The 3rd Russian Army is expected to attack here. The High Command chose your division to fill the gap at Limanowa and hold the lines until reinforcements relieve your men. General, you must stop the Russian steamroller here and now and prevent their break into Silesia and Hungary.

ORDER: Keep your MSU alive and hold at least 2 VHs.

NOTE: The High Command has approved the expansion of your forces to include an Artillery detachment.
