Herr General, the Soviets have trapped a number of our units in the city of Kovel. You and your men will make up part of a relief force and fight your way through the Soviet encirclement, opening a corridor to Kovel, thus allowing the withdrawal of our encircled troops. Good luck Herr General....

NOTE: You may now upgrade, add to, or buy replacements for your attached Airfleet from the German equipment roster...
