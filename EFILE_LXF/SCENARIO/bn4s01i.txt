STORY: The battle of Morava-Ivan was the first major Greek offensive in the Greco-Italian War of 1940-1941. It took place on the eastern flank of the Greek-Italian front, where the Italian forces had remained on the defensive during the initial Italian invasion toward Epirus. It was a major success for the Greek forces, not only on operational terms, but also as a morale boost, as the breaching of Morava-Ivan line led to the fall of the city of Korytsa to Greek hands, and made news internationally.

By 13 November, the Greek forces concentrated for the attack were the 10th, 9th and 15th (the former 4th Brigade) Divisions, all under III Corps commanded by Lieutenant General Georgios Tsolakoglou, which in turn was subordinate to West Macedonia Army Section under Lt. Gen. Ioannis Pitsikas. The 11th and 13th Divisions were on the march to further reinforce the Greek forces.

On the Italian side, there was the XXVI Corps, with the Parma, Piemonte and Venezia Divisions on the front, and the Arezzo Division as the corps reserve. Additional reinforcements in the form of the Alpini Division Tridentina and other Alpini elements began arriving from 13 November, but were committed piece-meal and had little impact.
Plan

The Greek plan was to put the main effort on the left, along the mountainous road through the village Darza, rather through the Cangonj pass, as there were fears that the Italians could use armour through the relatively flat terrain of the Cangonj pass. The Greeks would attack with the 15th Division on the right (toward Cangonj), the 9th in the centre and the 10th on the left. The 15th had the task of approaching the Cangonj pass, between Ivan and Morava, and capturing if possible its western exit. The 9th would attack toward the Morava mountain, coordinating its left flank with the 10th Division. The 10th Division had the task of penetrating the Italian position, through the use of surprise, and if possible flank the Italian positions atop of Morava.
