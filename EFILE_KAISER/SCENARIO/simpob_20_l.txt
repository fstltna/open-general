I can't understand what happened to us. We tried everything, but nothing worked. The Reds resisted. We threw everything that we had at them, and they were still capable of fighting back. Our offensive was a complete failure.

My last hopes were gone. We were doomed. Soon we'd have to choose between death, a life under the Bolshevik yoke, or leaving Russia forever.

It hasn't passed one single day that I haven't thought that, if we had advanced faster, or if the Cossacks had been more disciplined, we could have actually encircled the Soviet Army. But we failed at the worst possible time. We were facing a bleak future, and things would get much worse before the war was over.
