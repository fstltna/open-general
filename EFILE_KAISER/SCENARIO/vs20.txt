Operation Gericht - Verdun - February 21st 1916

Von Falkenhayn has decided that for Germany to win the war, France has to be bled dry. This has to be achieved by threatening to capture the city of Verdun - a national French symbol. The French will throw in all forces at their disposal to prevent the city from falling into our hands. Our artillery gets the task to destroy the masses of counterattacking French infantry. 

Our commander, Crown Prince Wilhelm understands that you cannot give soldiers the order of threatening a city without attacking it. So our goals are much more concrete. Before your forces are relieved, you should capture the fortresses of Douaumont, Vaux and Souville on the right bank of the Meuse.

Troops of [VIIR] Corps on your right flank will be put under your control once they have broken through the enemy first line of defense.

Player orders: Hold all 4 victory hexes at the end of the scenario for brilliant victory, 3 for victory, 2 for tactical victory and 1 or 0 for loss.
