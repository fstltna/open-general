Narvik
¯¯¯¯¯¯
Welcome Herr General
To prevent a British naval blockade we will seize the Norwegian coast before the Allies. The invasion of Denmark and Norway will consist of several task forces heading for specific ports. Your task force, Gruppe 1, will assigned the northern Norwegian port of Narvik. 

The Norwegian Navy will not be much of a problem. However an British flotilla has been sighted and will likely engage your units, so speed is of the highest importance.

Good luck, Herr General.
