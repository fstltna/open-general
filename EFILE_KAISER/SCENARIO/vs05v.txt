Le Cateau - Gen. Smith Dorrien makes a stand - August 1914 - V

Again you have struck a severe blow to the BEF. II Kavallerie Korps is ordered to keep on hitting the enemy as they retreat. 

Historical outcome August 26
- 6:30 IV Korps troops start entering Le Cateau. II Kavallerie Korps digs in in front of the 3rd and 4th Divisions while IV Korps infantry supported by artillery fire keeps on attacking the BEF's 5th Division - and the 19th Brigade that supports it - despite heavy losses caused by the BEF's artillery and accurate riffle fire. 
- 11:00 Attacks by II Kavalerie Korps supported by the artillery of the IV Reserve Korps are repulsed.
- 14:00 The advance guard of IV Reserve Korps shows up at the German right flank.
- 14:30 The British right flank starts to fall back under repeated attacks by IV Korps. On the other flank the German attacks by IV Reserve Korps troops are easily repulsed.
- 17:00 The rest of II Corps begins the retreat. Sordet's cavalry provides flank protection to the retreating BEF forces, hitting the 22nd German Reserve Division.
- 18:00 The German pursuit died and II Corps got away, leaving 7,812 men and 38 guns on the battlefield. German losses were much higher and they again lost time. Smith-Dorrien's decision to make a stand at Le Cateau however grew a serious rift between himself and his commander, Sir John French, head of the BEF.
