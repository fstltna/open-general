Majuri, Majuri! That was very close...
The Soviets threw in waves of infantry, filled the sky with glowing steel, tried to overrun your positions with masses of tanks and finally used a new kind of warfare. Paratroopers are the name of the game. Well, very innovative.
Fortunately you held the front. We are very proud of your troops. All the officers will be decorated with the 'Summa-cross' and you will be promoted to the rank of Everstiluutnantti. 
Now you have to go back to the front. East of Summa at Muolaa our lines are thin and vulnerable. The Soviets will surly attack there. Timoshenko has to break through to Viipuri otherwise it'll cost him his head.
