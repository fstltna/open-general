Congratulations on a brilliant victory! 

The civilians are safe and your units are ready to fight another day. You must return to the Kilimanjaro area as the British troops are organizing an attack on our lines.

Historic aftermath: British troops landed in a swamp where they were stopped by fire from the German troops. The raid lasted two days and then the German troops evacuated the town. Casualties for both sides were light. After the retreat of the German troops, the British destroyed the fort and the wireless station. Some units were granted permission to loot the town, but this soon got out of hand.  There was much burning, robbing and destruction.  Due to this incident the British changed commanders and appointed General Smuts as head of their forces.
