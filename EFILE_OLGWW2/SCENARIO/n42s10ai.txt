Herr General,

Pretty soon we came to the conclusion that the Seine was also not suitable terrain for defense and such terrain will only be found along the Meuse and the Belgian border. We have clear indications that the Americans are planning an offensive in the direction of Nancy. You are to rush to the aid of the defenders there.

The defense of Nancy is very important right now. President Beck is desperately trying to make peace with the western allies. In order to attain this he has permitted the Italians, the Bulgarians and the Finns to get out of the war, and has withdrawn from Greece. At this moment secret negotiations are taking place in Spain: though Churchill is still insisting on an unconditional surrender he is the only one receiving our envoy.    

This is probably also the background to the American offensive: The Americans are afraid the English might waver and hope to win before the English get serious about peace.

[Important message!!! Please note that you will have to capture the "American" supply hex at 34,1 before being able to deploy your ground forces. Yes I know it doesn't seem logical, but this is done in order to simulate a late arrival of your ground forces]
