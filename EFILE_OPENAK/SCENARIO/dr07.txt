Operation Marita April1941
Operation Marita, the plan to capture Greece has been complicated after a coup d'etat in Yugoslavia. This coup has ousted the government we signed a protocol with 2 days earlier - which is 2 weeks ago now - a protocol that brought Yugoslavia in the Tripartite Pact. The new government has canceled the protocol and Hitler thinks they will sooner or later join the Allies. He has ordered our troops to not only invade Greece as planned, but Yugoslavia as well. The task of your troops - your division is renamed SS-Division Das Reich - is to cross the border from Rumania into Yugoslavia and to capture Belgrade. The Heer does not want the Waffen SS to capture Belgrade and has added the GrossDeutschland Regiment to your troops. They have also ordered the 8th Panzer division to move on Belgrade from Hungary and has given similar orders to the 11th Panzer Division stationed in Bulgaria.
