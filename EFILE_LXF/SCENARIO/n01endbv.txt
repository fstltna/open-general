Another great victory for our cause!  Comrade General, I am happy to let you know tha... What!  Are you sure?  You are absolutely positive that your men have encountered American troops on the battlefield?  This is very alarming.  Yes, we have encountered aerial and naval strikes from American units but not yet on the ground.  I will contact my superiors and inform you at our next briefing.  For now, exploit your victory by advancing in the direction of Taejon.
