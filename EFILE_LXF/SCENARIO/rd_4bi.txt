Comrade General, have you ever been to Italy? Nyet? Well, you will soon be taking a, how shall we say, tour of the country, da?  The Party has selected you to begin the attack on Italy due to your performance in the battle for Berlin.  The initial strike will be here, at Taranto.  Your forces will be landing against fierce Allied resistance, since the cowardly Italians have pleaded for Allied help against our unstoppable onslaught.  Allied ships pose a major threat to the invasion, so we have sent you a small fleet of our mighty Soviet submarines to sink the badly made Allied tin cans.  Good luck, comrade General.
