Unternehmen Radowitz

Jul 14th, 1918

While you were fighting in Greece the Alpenkorps, as well as some Austrian units, broke the Italian lines in Trient and quickly took Verona and Vicenza. But now, after weeks of fighting, they're exhausted and we need you to relieve them. You'll have to follow the offensive, advancing on the right bank of the Po Valley until you reach the Adriatic Sea. 
Although the Italian Army has tried to react, they've been too slow, and most of our enemies are still on the Piave river. So, once you emerge victorious, most of the Italian Army will be trapped between the Piave and the Po, and our divisions will be free to race southwards down the country. 
Naturally, that doesn't mean that the Po Valley is undefended. The Italian Ninth Army has taken positions in Bologna and the neighbouring towns and they'll do their best in order to stop you. Good luck against them!

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.
