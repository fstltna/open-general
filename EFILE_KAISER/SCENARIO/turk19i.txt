Battle of Dumlupinar - August 26th, 1922

It's time to recover our country. After the battle of Sakarya, the Grand National Assembly has made agreements with France, Italy, and the Soviet Union. Most of our enemies are tired of this war, and are willing to leave us alone. Only the British still support the Greek invaders, but they won't risk the lives of their own soldiers.

Mustafa Kemal has decided that we must launch a final attack on the Greek defensive line. They are overstretched, demoralized, and their line of communications with their headquarters at Izmir is inoperative. However, they still have a huge army on the field, so we only have one chance. We can't afford a defeat.

Your First Army will attack northwards, assisted by the V Cavalry Corps by infiltrating through less guarded Greek positions in Kirka valley, and coming behind the Greek front lines. At the same time, our Second Army will attack westwards.

The first objective is to cut the railroad lines, thus encircling the Greek forces. If you succeed, all the enemy front will crumble.

Orders: Take all VHs.

Ataturk's HQ must survive.
