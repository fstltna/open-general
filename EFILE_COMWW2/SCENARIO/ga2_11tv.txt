Your performance was satisfactory, Herr General, considering the situation. You managed to break out of the Soviet encirclement relatively intact! I must now inform you that the Sturmbrigade Wallonien and the Panzergrenadier-Battalion Narwa are now being withdrawn from your division. Wallonien will be sent back to Wildflecken to be reformed, and Narwa will be integrated into 
the 20th Estonian SS-Freiwilligen-Divison at Debrecia....
