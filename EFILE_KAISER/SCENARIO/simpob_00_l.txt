Kappel was an extremely competent officer, but the Red Army was too powerful for us at that time. After six weeks of fighting we had been defeated, the Komuch was disbanded, and we were forced to leave Samara. To make things even worse, the Tsar and his family were cruelly murdered by the Bolsheviks in the month of July.

Fortunately, in the east the Czech Legion had conquered all the important outposts along the Trans-Siberian Railway, from Samara to Irkutsk. So we joined them on their evacuation, and before the end of the summer we had arrived safely in Ufa.
