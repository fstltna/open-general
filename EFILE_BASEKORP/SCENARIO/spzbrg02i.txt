Galician Campaign

Part 3/4 of the "Blitzkrieg" minicampaign


"Morning Hauptmann! Nice to see you! And your men, of course! 

Now, do you see that bridge? We must cross it. I've heard that the last time the Poles were fast enough to blow it, but now we'll be faster than they. The road beyond it is blocked by some infantry and MGs. The village is also defended by some infantrymen. Problem is that the Poles know very well that we must finally turn back to north and that this road is our only path through the quagmire. 


Victory conditions: Capture the VH.

Hint: Poles have withdrawn across the river, leaving the whole clearway unoccupied, thus making their defense very strong.
