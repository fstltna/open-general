CO General Erwin Rommel

General! The enemy become stronger with each day. We must bring back movement into the front line. We keep our proven tactics, which brought us success so far. Our Infantry troops launch a mock attack on the enemy positions in the north and your troops attack with our tanks in the south. Good luck!
