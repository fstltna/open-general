
TARAKAN - 11 JAN 1942

East off Tarakan Island, Borneo
CO Admiral Shoji Nishimura

After your success at Wake you and your men are now part of the forces to seizure Dutch Borneo. With their foolish declaration of war the Dutch have given us the pretext to attack the Dutch East Indies. Your goal is Tarakan Island in northeastern Borneo. This island is interesting for us because of its oil reserves and its airfield. Secure the oil fields and let no Dutch ships escape.

UPG: 3 x Inf - 37 SNLF Infantry -> 42 SNLF Infantry

GOAL: Take all VHs and prevent the escape of more than 1 enemy naval unit via Exit Point!


BACKGROUND

The Battle of Tarakan took place on January 11-12, 1942, beginning a day after Japan declared war on the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Although Tarakan was only a small marshy island off northeastern Borneo in the Netherlands East Indies, the island's 700 oil wells, oil refinery, and airfield made it a crucial objectives for the Empire of Japan in the Pacific War.

On January 10, 1942, after a Dutch Dornier Do 24K flying boat spotted an approaching Japanese invasion fleet, the commander of Tarakan's garrison ordered the destruction of all oil installations on the island.

The Japanese forces of the Right Wing Unit from the Sakaguchi Detachment landed on the east coast of Tarakan at midnight on January 11, 1942, followed by the 2nd Kure Special Naval Landing Force. After mounting brief, but fierce resistance, the heavily outnumbered Koninklijk Nederlands Indisch Leger (Royal Netherlands East Indies Army, or KNIL) garrison surrendered in the morning of January 12.

During the night of January 11, before Japan completed the blockade of Tarakan, the Dutch submarine K-X, the patrol boat P-1, and the civilian motor launch Aida slipped away. The Dutch minelayer Prins van Oranje tried to escape as well but was sunk by the Japanese destroyer Yamakaze, under Lt. Cdr Shuichi Hamanaka, and the patrol boat P-38.
