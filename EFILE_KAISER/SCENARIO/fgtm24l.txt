Gospodin General-Leitenant, so ends the year of 1915 on our North-Western Front.  The Front has failed to accomplish any strategic offensive plans and has stablized along a line deep within our territory.  The massive Germano-Austrian offensive during the second half of the year has shattered morale but failed to rout us.  Your participation in the action in North Poland during our retreat has played a major role in delaying the German advance:  from Novogeorgievsk to Narotch you stood between German staff expectations and reality.  The massive cavalry engagement at Narotch may well be the last we have seen in this war.  The elan of our Guard Cavalry Division will resonate through German divisional histories, but at a heavy price..

The Army has regrouped and re-equipped.  Our Prussian enemy has been cornered into a two-front war of attrition on a massive scale.  The year of 1916 will see a more co-ordinated effort by the Entente to bring this war to an end.
