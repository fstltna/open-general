Situation report: The Japanese have suffered a serious setback at Isurava. However, they still hold the key strategic point of Kokoda. It is believed that they have only left a small rear guard in place to hold Kokoda while the bulk of the South Seas Detachment has retreated to Buna for resupply. Despite the tortuous conditions of the Kokoda Trail and the impenetrable Jungle of the New Guinea Highlands, Kokoda must be taken.

Operational orders: There are two critical tasks you must perform. The first is to capture the village of Deniki. It is held by a sizable force, but controls the crossroads of the Kokoda trail. The Japanese have also left rear guards at various places along the trail to slow any advance towards Kokoda. It is up to you to decide the proper strategy for the battle, but headquarters suggests that you may want to attempt a flanking manuever through the Jungle to bypass the Japanese positions in order to attack Kokoda.
