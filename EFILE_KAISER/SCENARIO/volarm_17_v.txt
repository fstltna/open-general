Everything has gone as planned. Most of out civilian sympathizers and our soldiers have been evacuated to Crimea. The Reds have suffered many casualties and won't be able to harass us.

However, Denikin won't come with us. He believes that his staff has lost confidence in him, so he has resigned from his position. He'll go into exile, and Wrangel will be our new commander.

We still have a weak point at the Perekop Isthmus. Should it fall, all of Crimea would be in danger. Wrangel has ordered me to go there and command its defence, and I'll go there as soon as possible. It's more that just my duty: my family's safety depends on it. Katya, the children and Olga, Anatoly's wife, who is expecting her first child, have been evacuated to Simferopol, so I must do my best in order to prevent the Reds from taking Crimea.
