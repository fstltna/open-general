The first days of the battle of Cambrai were a splendid triumph. We took all our objectives quickly and with few casualties, and the Germans seemed broken. But we had lost most of our tanks, and the roads were nearly impassable due to mud and snow. On November 27th all units were ordered to consolidate.
