08. UFA (9 June 1919)

The Czech Legion had withdrawn itself from the Russian Civil War and was only sparsely involved when 1918 ended. However, still elements of the Legion were scattered as far west as Ufa, near the Ural mountains, when the White Russian forces of Koltsjak were on the retreat under pressure of a huge Soviet offensive aimed at destroying the White Russians in Siberia.

The White Russian Siberian Army has suffered defeat after defeat and is retreating towards to Ural mountains where it hopes to stop the Soviet advance. The important city of Ufa has just now fallen in Soviet hands. Czech Legion units are near Ufa and are in immediately threat of being attacked.

You are in command of the Czech Legion units near Ufa. You must hold any enemy from blocking the railroads going east, to the Ural mountains and safeguard the railroad. It might be needed to engage Soviet units because the White Russian army might not be able to stem the Soviet advance...
