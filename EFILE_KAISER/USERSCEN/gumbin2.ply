Tannenberg: Gumbinnen

August 20, 1914

The Russian 1st Army advanced into Eastern Prussia with the aim of besieging Koenigsberg and swinging south to meet the 2nd Army (Samsonov), which was advancing northward out of Russian Poland.  The city of Gumbinnen lay west of Satlluponen and formed the first line of German defense.

Since the Russian 1st Army was days ahead of the 2nd, the solution of the German 8th Army was to deploy its forces against Rennekampf, check his advance, and then redeploy to stop Samsonov.  The German I (von Francois), XVII (von Mackensen), and I Reserve (von Below) Corps were to engage the 1st Army.  The I Corps led the effort.

Rennekampf's army advanced with the III (Epanchin), XX (Smirnov), and IV (Aliev) Corps.  In a massive battle that ensued, German and Russian troops clashed at full speed.  Von Francois, darting forward out of Gumbinnen in an effort to surprise the Russians, was in turn surprised by the speed of the Russian III COrps advance.  Russian field guns, firing directly over the heads of its infantry left masses of German dead and wounded on the fields.  As the XVII and I Reserve Corps arrived to the field, the Russian forces engaged them with similar results.

After an undeniable victory at Gumbinnen, Rennekampf became reluctant to pursue the Germans and convert the victory into a rout.  The 1st Army - with its massive presence of 5 cavalry divisions - deployed its bulk too far to the north and was unable to use its mobile arm in pursuit.  Rennekampf's hesitation at this stage in the August Campaign would become the subject of analysis, controversy, and suspicion.
