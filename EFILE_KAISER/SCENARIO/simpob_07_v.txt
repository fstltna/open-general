We did our best, and we actually defeated he Bolsheviks in Belebei. But it wasn't enough. North and south of our positions, the Reds kept on advancing, so if we stayed we'd eventually be outflanked and encircled. With tears in our eyes, we had to retreat to Ufa and build a new line of defence there.
