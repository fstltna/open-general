02. KISHENEV (14 July 1941)

Comrade! The Germans have broken through our lines and are advancing with high speed. However, to their south, the Rumanians have still not managed a breakthrough thanks to your men. However if you do not retreat immediately you will be cut off and this would be a disaster! 

You have orders to pull back to Odessa at once. First make it to Kishenev which contains the only road leading out of Bessarabia still in our hands. Be quick because the Rumanian and German fascists are on our heals! Good luck, comrade!
