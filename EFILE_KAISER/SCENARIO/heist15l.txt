Kindralmajor,

The harsh reality of a small nation's existence among giants has reared its ugly head today.  We must now rely on diplomacy to protect our sovereignty, but do we have friends around us?  The Ministry is forced to withdraw our troops from Latvia at this time of turmoil within the nation.  Your command on the Eastern Estonain Front has been given to a more capable general, and this is the end of your campaign.
