Fort de Brimont
April 16, 1917

Gospodin General, welcome to the Western Front.  The 1st Brigade (Lokhvitsky) of the Russian Expeditionary Corps is in line north of Rheims with the VII (Baselere) Corps.  The brigade has performed several trench raids successfully, earning itself a feared reputation among the Germans.

The main effort of the French Nivelle offensive is concentrated along the ridge known as Chemin de Dammes north of the Aisne - to be performed by the French 6th (Mangin) and 10th (Ouchene) Armies.  The Russian brigades, part of the French 5th (Mazel) Army, are tasked with a secondary objective of striking eastward from their positions at the heavily fortified Fort de Brimont.  The neighboring French 14th and 41st divisions are to strike at the towns of Berry-au-Bac and Beremicourt respectively.

Including 9301 soldiers and officers, the Russian brigades are larger in size than most French divisions in 1917.  Along with the raiding reputation, the Russian brigades are considered by the French to be formidable assault units.
