Let me explain the situation, General. Uman is the last strongly defended position before the Dnieper. If you can take the city and surround the remnants of the Soviet 6th and 12th Armies, we can advance toward Kiev from the South and meet Guderian's 2nd Panzer Army attacking from the North, and encircle Kiev, in which a million Bolsheviks would be trapped.

HINT: A small German reinforcement is coming from North.

NOTE: You have 25 DHs. Take all VHs!
