Gospodin General-Major, you have achieved an unprecedented victory in this war!  The most powerful fortresses of Lemberg and Przemysl - Austria's pride of fortress engineering - have ceased to protect her borders within two months of commencement of hostilities.  The garrison of Przemysl - over 150,000 men - has been securely trapped within a siege ring of your making.  Austria-Hungary's last line of defense - the natural barrier of the Carpathian Mountains stands in the way of the empire's conquest by your forces!
