August, 48 B.C. * Pharsalos

....After Caesar had withdrawn successfully to Apollonia to recover his Legions, and to supply them with enough Grain; he followed the Legions of the Pompey with his whole army power....
....Caesar repeatedly had set up his Troops for the battle, but Pompey rejected time after time the battle....
....The senators (who followed the pompeian army) pressed Pompey that he should honour old Roman traditions, and finally lead the army, even against his own advice, to the battle....
.... At Pharsalos Pompey finally positioned himself to Caesar, awaiting the battle....

....The hostile armed forces were, compared to Caesars, numerically far superior....
....However, the experienced veterans of the Gallic war followed Caesar - The legions of the Pompey were almost consisting out of unexperienced troops....

....When Caesar saw the formation of the opposing cavalry, he ordered to rapidly set up a fourth defensive line: She should run square with Caesars main fight line, so that the enemy cannot see it....
....Caesar wants to lure the pompeian cavalry into this trap....
