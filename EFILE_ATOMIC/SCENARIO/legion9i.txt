SITUATION:

Mainland Greece is under control and the Guns of Navarone have been destroyed. Now the approaches to Crete are secure. Your experienced task force will carry out the initial landings on Crete, alongside our German ally.

ORDERS: 

Take all VHs in 16/20/26 turns for a BV/V/TV.

NOTES:

You can buy up to 2 new units in this scenario.

You start without an own airfield and have to build one once your sappers or paratrooper engineers have landed. A fast builder attachment will be useful.

Two german submarines in position at the southwestern tip of Crete await your orders.
