Ryburn's Diary - September 10th, 2052

"What do you think these guys are fighting for?  They seem awfully determined."

"It takes guts to throw the kind of forces they did at us in my last engagement.  Maybe that's why the brass have sent us to the coast.   They're calling it a 'reprisal' operation; I guess they think taking some villages will help lower enemy morale."

"All enemy forces have been classified as 'combatants', and we have orders to shoot to kill.  If that's what it takes to teach these bastards a lesson, then that's what we'll do."
