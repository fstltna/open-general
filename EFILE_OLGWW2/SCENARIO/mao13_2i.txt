Seoul: UN Counterattack

Seoul, beyond the 38th Paralell, near to the former DMZ.

25-1-1951

The lightning advances of December and early January provide us with the opportunity to easily retake Seoul for the North Koreans.  However, the situation is becoming dangerous.  Our supply lines to China are long and are constantly being bombed and strafed by the UN air force.  Because of this they are preparing a counterattack to again liberate Seoul.  Our Korean spies have told us that a great number of troops are concentrating South of Suwon, including modern tanks and heavy artillery.

Be careful, our troops are nearly exhausted due to the quick advances in the past months. Your mission is to protect Seoul at all costs and if possible defeat the capitalist advance.
