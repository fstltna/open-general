
SAAR I - 7 SEP 1939

Mon General, our beloved France is once again forced to wage war on Germany. For the third time in almost 70 years. We do stand alone and the United Kingdom has joined us. While the German Army is occupied fighting the Polish Army in the East, we must take advantage of this situation by attacking the western border of Germany - at the industrial Saar region!

You are ordered to conduct an offensive operation against the Saarland from our Maginot Line positions. First you will have to cross the Saar River and establish a defendable bridgehead. Once this is secured reinforcements will be send to exploit the gap. Intelligence is not sure about the quality of the German Westwall. But it can be no second Maginot Line of course. Plus the best German troops must be fighting in Poland. Vive la France!

GOAL: Take all VH's!

NOTE: You do not start with core units. You have to buy them.
