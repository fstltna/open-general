You've succeeded, but our scouts inform that the Russians reserves will arrive in just a few hours. You must stop your advance, and your troops will have to go back to their starting positions. It's so frustrating... no matter how hard we try; it seems that the defenders of Premissel are doomed. 

Naturally, our winter offensive on the Karpaten will continue, but I don't think that we'll achieve our goals. In just a few months, our army has suffered too many losses, and we can't recover from that while we're fighting on two different fronts. However, with the help of the Germans, we could try again when the spring comes. Then, things could be very different.
