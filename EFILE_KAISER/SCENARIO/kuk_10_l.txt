Your failure could have costed us the loss of Krakau. Thank God that the other commanders have succeeded in other sectors, forcing the Russians to retreat.

We can't allow things like these to happen, General. We can't afford them. You're good at administrative tasks, but leading real troops on a real battlefield is something very different. You'll be assigned to the garrison of Prague, where you can contribute to the war effort being, at the same time, as far from the battlefield as possible. It will be the best for everybody, including you.
