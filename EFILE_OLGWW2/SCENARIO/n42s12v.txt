General,

Though it cost us some of our last reserves, we have inflicted two considerable defeats on the Americans. Now political opponents of Rooseveld, sustained by the anti-communist movement, have forced the American government to receive our envoy!

Also we got our peace-offer: the 1937 borders, public in the US press, and announced that, as a sign of good will, we will immediately retreat from Belgium and France. We might still have a chance to split the coalition apart.... 

You are now to retreat from Alsace and go to the east.
