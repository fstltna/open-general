Our daring counter-attack thrown the enemy of balance and now it is time to consolidate our gains and secure the area. But this is a task for the intantry; your battalion will be relieved from combat.

For now you will be transfered to base in East Prussia, where you will receive new Panzer IVs, some of them long-barelled. Your men will undergo an intensive training: there's a grand offensive planned for the next year's spring, and you will participate in it.
