KMT Anihilation Campaign

10-11-1930, Jinggangshan mountains, Jiangxi, SE China.

Comrade Mao has established a "Soviet Commune'' here in the Jinggangshan Mountains.  It is well protected and hidden from our enemies by a heavy wilderness and bamboo trees.  All the access points to our base are under continuous servalance and our Soviet GRU spies report that the Kuomingtan enemies and the Warlords are planning to eradicate us at once.  They are supported by German advisors who think the best way to eliminate us from here is the so-called strategy ''ferocious walls''.  They are blocking our exits by constructing blockhouses.  We will resist their attacks as long as possible.  Mao thinks we will leave here soon and go North which is much closer to the Soviet border.

Our Soviet advisors suggest that we let the enemy troops pass through the mountains and then annihilate them on a familiar battlefield.
