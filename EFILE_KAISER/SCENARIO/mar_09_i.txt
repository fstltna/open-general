September, 8th, 1925

Conversation at Gen. Sanjurjo Sacanell's HQ:

The time has come, General. Your troops must establish the eastern beachheads at Alhucemas Bay and then they will have to take Axdir, the main focus of Abd el-Krim's rebellion. If all goes well, this operation will make us win this war. We trust in you, General. Go!


Victory conditions: Take all VHs.
