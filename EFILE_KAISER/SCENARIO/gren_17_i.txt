July 31st, 1917

Although severely weakened, the German Army was still a magnificent war machine and a terrible enemy. Between the end of the campaign of the Somme and the summer of 1917 the Germans managed to conquer Romania, to bring Russia to a revolution and to the verge of surrender, and to defeat the French at the Aisne. Some French units actually mutinied, and for some days it seemed that the front could collapse. Our own offensive at Messines had only a limited success, and our enemies had been able to take reinforcements to the Italian front. In fact, the only real good news was that, finally, the United States declared war on Germany.

Under these circumstances, Haig decided that it was necessary to relieve our allies and wear out the Germans, so he ordered an attack on the Ypres salient that, if successful, would secure the Belgian coast. The plan had been carefully made, and due to the coordinated use of planes, tanks, artillery and elite infantry our methods for gathering intelligence and assaulting fortified positions had improved remarkably. On the other hand, so had the German defensive tactics, and Haig's prestige had suffered after the Somme, so our offensive was controversial from the beginning.

Acknowledging my past victories with relatively few losses, Haig decided that my Army Corps would lead our first attack, crossing the Ypres Canal at the dawn of July 31st. Our objectives  were the very same places where we had fought in 1914, now devastated after years of war. In front of us there were three German divisions and several lines of fortifications.
