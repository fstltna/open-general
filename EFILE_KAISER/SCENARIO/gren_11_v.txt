At Landrecies and Grand Fayt we taught the Germans what a fighting retreat means. We inflicted on them great losses, and we also secured the II Corp's right flank, giving them a great advantage at Le Cateau. Once we accomplished our goals, we marched to the South. The enemy dared not to pursue us for a few days.
