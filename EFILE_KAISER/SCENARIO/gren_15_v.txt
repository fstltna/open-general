My small-scale tactics worked again at the Hohenzollern Redoubt. Among all the British divisions that were heavily engaged there, mine was the one with the least casualties. In fact, on October 12th we were replaced by the 46th Division whose assault on German positions the next day ended in a dreadful slaughter.

The failure at Loos marked the end of sir John French as commander of the British Expeditionary Force. He was replaced by Haig in December. Haig had a good opinion of me, and he recommended my promotion to Lieutenant General, which was finally approved in February 1916. I was very happy with this recognition, but that was overshadowed by the pride that I felt for my sons. Michael had been promoted to Major and assigned to Egypt, where he had been born, and William, following the steps of his older brother, was already a Lieutenant, at only 22 years old. I could not suspect at that time that the hardest blow that I would have to take in my life was getting very close.
