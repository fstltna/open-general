Defense of Voronezh
After our successes in the winter the Germans seems to have their troops reinforced. With their Hungarian allies they are starting a big offensive with the target Voronezh. Slow down the advance of the Germans, so we have enough time to prepare new positions. 
Your troops:
You have command over the 40. and 13. Army. These troops are equipped with very new prototypes of SU tank destroyers. They could be useful for you.
Enemy troops:
You are facing the 4. Panzerarmee and the 2. Army. Moreover, in the south the 2. Hungarian Army supports them. The Hungarians are not so experienced like the Germans. The Germans have also new assault guns with higher range than our tanks. Be aware of them! Oh, wait, we have just this moment obtained the information that the Germans have marched off more troops with good tanks and tank destroyers. They will arrive in the south of the battlefield in several days.
