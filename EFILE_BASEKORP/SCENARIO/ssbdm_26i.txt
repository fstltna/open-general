    "Why You little Sneaky Bastards" 
  The United States of America.FDR knew sooner or later that Japanese aggression would spill over to attack America's holdings.He had guranteed it by cutting off their Oil over the Conflict with China.And here it was.So the trap had been layed,the Pacific Fleet moved near Wake and ready to pounce on the unsuspecting Jap fleet.On paper the U.S. a more formidable force,on the Sea and in the air.In reality though the Japanese were more fanatical and their ships though out-numbered were far superior with Sailors having experience gained from conflicts with the Russians,British and Chinese.In the Air was where the Japanese really had the advantage.Out-numbered again but the 'Zero was worth 2 American planes if not 5. And again the Pilots of the Imperial Japanese Air Force fighting over land in China had the Air in their hands there and had gained valuable experience in the art of 'Dog-fighting'.So Japan's attack would be all through the Pacific but their main Goal was to destroy the Pacific Fleet,con the West Coast Fleet into moving to protect Pearl and destroy It.Pearls capture or not was insignificant but would be a Trophy for Admiral Ionca Aku of the 5th Imperial Fleet.
