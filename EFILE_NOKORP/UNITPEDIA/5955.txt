Members of the Brandenburg German special forces unit.
Initially they were an intelligence unit in charge of infiltration and sabotage behind the enemy lines, constituted of foreign volunteers. Usually already living in the target areas, the Brandenburgers were familiar with the local situation and thus more efficient.
Later in the war they were reclassified as fighting unit and eventually turned into a Panzergrenadiere division.
The predecessor to the Brandenburg Division was the Battalion Ebbinghaus.

In OG they are the Germans' special forces/commandos, since the German army didn't have any.
