The Battle of Jerusalem - November 17th, 1917

At last, the British conquered the important ports of Jaffa and Gaza. After these fights, in which both sides suffered heavy losses, the Turkish army has gathered in Jerusalem.

Now the German general Erich von Falkenhayn has taken over the command of the Ottoman forces in Palestine, but it seems that we can't hold our lines for much longer....We must withdraw immediately, in order to spare our forces and to to continue the fighting in a new, more favorable strategical  position.

Orders: 
Hold 7 VHs for a brilliant victory. Hold 6 VHs for a victory and 5 VHs for a tactical victory.
