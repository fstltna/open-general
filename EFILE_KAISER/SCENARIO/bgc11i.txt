Cape Helles Evacuation 07/01/1916
----------------------------------------------------------
General, since our failed August offensive, there have been discussions going on about breaking off this whole ill-fated campaign. Recently, Bulgaria has joined the Central Powers, so that Germany now can supply the Turks with heavy artillery and ammunition by rail to Istanbul which makes our situation even more precarious. Furthermore, troops are needed to support Serbia and Greece against the Central Powers' combined offensive in the Balkans.  In November, Lord Kitchener visited the peninsula to get a clear picture of the situation here at the Dardanelles Front and finally accepted the need for evacuation. In December, the evacuation of our troops at Suvla and ANZAC was completed successfully.
The evacuation of Helles will start in a couple of hours, and your 29th Division has been given the task to act as rearguard against a possible Turkish attack on our retreating troops.
You have to hold your positions at all costs, until the wounded have embarked and equipment and ammunition that we have to leave behind have been destroyed.

NOTE: Use the Royal Engineers to destroy the stores and dumps on the VHs at Sedd-El-Bahr and at 'W' Beach. You also have to occupy these two VHs! After that you can embark the Royal Engineers and the "Wounded" from the shores. The scenario will be won as soon as you have occupied the VHs on the ocean.
