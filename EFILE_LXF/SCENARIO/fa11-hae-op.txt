01/20/1940   Haegglunds Mottis

Ready for the second phase?  
During the past week you have pushed the Soviets around and severely thinned their lines.
Situation report: The remnants of the two Soviet divisions are entrenched in a Mottis. Our light artillery can't seem to destroy their bunkers and the weather isn't as bad as in the battle for Suomussalmi. No chance here to starve them out.
Enemy: The 168th and 18th Rifle divisions have been identified and there are still rumors about a Tank division. Take care.
Our forces: Your group and the 12th and 13th divisions. Both divisions have been refitted, but are low on ammunition.

Destroy all Soviet troops in the Mottis. Turn this into a second Suomussalmi!
