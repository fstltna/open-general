Good Morning General
The British 8th army has finally taken the ridge overlooking the Sangro river valley. Now we  move. You will be supported by the 2nd New Zealander division arriving shortly from the south. Your mission is to capture Orsonga, San Leonardo, Casa Berardi, and ultimately Ortona. Good luck General...
