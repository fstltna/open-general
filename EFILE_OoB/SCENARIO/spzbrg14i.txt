"Hoarfrost? In two days we'll be knees-deep in this hoarfrost! Set off the warning...

Herr General, meteorologists say that the snowfall won't cease not even after the New Year. In two days there will be just a single mobile unit in the whole sector - your brigade. Both the Romanians and Hungarians lack halftracks and their respective commanders already reported that except for the tanks, they are stuck, immobile. I order you to support their offensive actions with full commitment.

General Bistroff, this is the turning point in the whole Russian campaign, and I hope you already understand this. We are on the brink of total collapse and the Soviets know this. We must immediatelly, without any delay, renew our offensive actions. We must shatter the whole Soviet line once again for the final time, break through it, destroy the enemy groupings and rush towards Moscow. This is the last blow, after which the Soviets will fall apart, but it must be dealt fast, lest..."


Victory conditions: After 15 turns hold six VHs for a BV, five for a V and four for a TV.

Hint: After we've broken through the initial defensive line, we must secure the area and hold the counterattack. Capture and hold the VHs... and then we may finally rush south towards Moscow.

Warning: Although the saying "the weather is our worst enemy" became very popular during the last weeks, you shouldn't forget about the REAL enemy. You're very, very close to final victory and the Soviets know that. And the Soviets are very, very close to their supply bases full of fresh Siberian units... but you know that. Expect an extremely strong Soviet counterattack coming from the south. You'll do much better if you wait for the Soviets in prepared positions. Meet them in the open and you're in a serious trouble.

There's a reason for the many auxiliaries available.
The enemy will come in six hours.
This does not look good...
