All right, time for our first serious river crossing. There is a fortified town on the other side you need to take. We know the Russians will be expecting us, but speed is of the essence. 

Cheer up, High Command has given you a prototype unlike any other: A "land cruiser"! The Landkreuzer's twin 280mm naval guns will open the way, any way, any time...
It's very unlikely we'll ever build more than that one, but our Führer liked the idea so much we had to build that one, you know how he is. Note the Führer will most likely skin you alive if the Landkreuzer is destroyed... You have been warned.

Given you're going to butt against fortifications, High Command has also given you an old Austrian WWI siege mortar, a 30.5 cm M.11. Fortunately the Slovakian army had stockpiled some of those, they don't build them like that anymore...



Instructions: Capture all VHs. You have been given among others a very powerful unit, a "land cruiser"; If it gets destroyed you automatically lose the game.
