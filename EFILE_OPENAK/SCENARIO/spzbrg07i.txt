Belgian Counterattack

Part 2/3 of the "Westfeldzug" minicampaign


"Oberst Bistroff? I'm Hauptmann Krone. Nice to meet you, I'm really glad to see your tanks! Would you like to drink something? Service! Bring us coffee.

Herr Oberst, we're stuck here and we just can't move any further. The river banks are occupied by the enemy, with the infantry heavily entrenched and supported by guns and MGs. But that's not the worst of it. The enemy has a strong tank force just beyond the river... see, there, no, sorry... there! Every time we tried to move across the meadow, they counterattacked. And we cannot bypass the meadow, because of the infantry I mentioned. Pardon? What types of panzern? Well, every type imaginable. Looks like they gathered everything possible, mounted it on wheels and pressed it into service. What? Yes, they have both Chars and Somuas. Cruiser tank? Yes, indeed mein Herr, they have those. Pardon? Yes, Matildas too. Naturally.

They have some thirty or so tanks and it's far too many for us. We just can't move any further and the Luftwaffe is doing her job very badly. Yes, I know, we're too far from their bases, but say this to my men. Their morale is low and I'm very glad that we are relieved.

Good luck! I hope that you'll succeed where we have failed."


Victory conditions: Capture all VHs

Hint: Sometimes the second best result is the best. That... or you may try YOUR best. But don't cry if you lose some units. You've been warned.

There are some reinforcements on their way, but it will take them many hours before they reach us. Luftwaffe is also on its way and they'll come much sooner, but they need at least a dirt airfield. Be aware of the Allied airplanes.
