A major problem was the rough terrain, but you have established excellent positions near the Nalon river.  The Reds quarters at both Simancas and Zapadores have fallen and we are now at the gates of Oviedo.  We must press on to save our brave fellows from the Red onslaught and show the world that we are not going to surrender without a fight.

Buen trabajo.
