Race to Kijów

May 5th, 1920

The good news is that Symon Petliura will be able to establish a Ukrainian government in Kijów. The bad news is that our ambush didn't work and the Red Army is fleeing. It seems that they decided not to defend Kijów and instead retreated to the eastern bank of the Dniepr river.   

If we can occupy Kijów fast enough, we can prevent the Russians from stealing many Ukrainian goods, food and documents. The Ukrainian Army will attack south of you. If you secure the bridgeheads before they arrive, we will have a better hand in further political talks. 
But don't expect any cooperation. In the summer of 1919, they invited Denikin's troops to the town and the White Russians betrayed their trust and made a bloodbath there. Now they don't trust foreigners at all.

Victory conditions: Take the VH at (22,12). Be quicker than the Ukrainians. You must achieve your objectives before them.

Intelligence report: The Bolsheviks are fleeing. A few units will try to slow you down. You can also expect some blockroads but HQ is sure that there will be no counterattacks. The 6th Ukrainian Division will attack south of you but don't expect any cooperation from them.

Good luck!

Recommended core: Use only cavalry or motorised units.

Note: You can only deploy 4 units in this scenario.
