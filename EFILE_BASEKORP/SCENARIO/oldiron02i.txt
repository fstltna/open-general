02. The drive on Tunis - Battle for Djedeïda - November 25th, 1942

With more of our troops arriving in Tunisia, it is time for a new attempt to take Mateur, Tebourba and Djedeïda - followed up by the capture of Bizerte and Tunis. The fall of those two ports would cut off the Axis lifeline to Italy and would force the Axis troops in North Africa to surrender.

Again we will attack in three colums: 36 Brigade Group in the North, Blade Force in the center and 11th Brigade Group in the South. A commando naval landing and paratrooper air drop are planned. The enemy has air superiority, but more of our fighters will be stationed closer to the front line soon and a heavy bomber raid should help you to break enemy lines. The remainder of your (core) CCB 1st Armored Division is on its way to Tunisia and will arrive in 3 to 4 days (7 game turns). 

The Germans are expected to field more experienced troops and armor that they keep on shipping from Italy. This attack won't be a walk in the park.

French troops will assist your forces, but they will not take orders from you. Your orders are to capture the cities of Mateur, Ferryville, Tebourba and Djedeïda. 

ORDERS
Take all Victory hexes in 12 or less turns for BV, 13-15 for V and 16-18 for TV.

NOTES: 
- You can deploy three core units at the start of this scenario, the rest later.
- French units are fighting on your side, but are controlled by the AI, not by you.
- Units will not be automatically reinforced to strength 10 at the end of the scenario.
