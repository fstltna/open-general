Well done!  You gave the Reds got a good licking at Guipuzcoa.  Now they will be unable to receive more supplies or weapons from France.  It's only a matter of time until the north is in our hands.  I'm sorry but you are not going to have time to enjoy the summer in San Sebastian.  I have another important task for you and it must be done quickly!
