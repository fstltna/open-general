Message from General Gómez Jordana's HQ:

I don't believe it! You haven't been able to end this campaign on time! I will send reinforcements to reach the last objectives, but you will be relieved of command. It's obvious that you are an unreliable officer. You'd better return to Spain and sit at a desk for the rest of your career.
