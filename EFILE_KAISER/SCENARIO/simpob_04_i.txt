Breakthrough: the Spring Offensive

March 1st, 1919

After recovering Ufa, Kolchak's staff started to plan our Spring Offensive. For better or worse, it would start in March. Our supply lines were still a mess, and many of our soldiers didn't have a decent training, but we couldn't wait any longer. 
In the north, our Siberian units would advance from Perm to Vyatka and Vologda, trying to connect with Yudenich and the British near Petrograd. In the south, Dutov's cossacks would attack Orenburg. In the centre, our final mission was to liberate Kazan, Simbirsk and Samara. But first we'd have to defeat the five Red divisions that were deployed east of Belebei.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.

Special note: 
- This is a semi-fictional scenario. The Whites didn't control Ufa when the Spring offensive began.
