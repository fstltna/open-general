
CASSINO - 17 JAN 1944

The Allies have reached the Gustav Line, the western part of which follows the Gargliano and Rapido Rivers. US and British Commonwealth forces are pushing across the Rapido in the vicinity of Cassino with the objective of capturing the town and the abbey of Montecassino, which controls the main road leading up the Liri valley - and then to Anzio and Rome.

Currently your forces are part of the US 5th Army and are on their right flank; your orders are to cross the Rapido above Cassino and advance into the mountains north of the town - defeating German forces and protecting the northern flank of the Cassino operation.

GOAL: Take all VH's!
