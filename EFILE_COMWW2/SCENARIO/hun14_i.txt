General, this offensive is our last hope. Hitler has grouped 1st and 2nd SS Panzer Corps West of Székesfehérvár in an attempt to retake the Transdanube area from the Bolsheviks, thereby destroying the Bolsheviks in the area between the Drava, the Danube and the Balaton. You must go to help them. If you could throw the Bolsheviks back to the Danube, they lost their initiative and we would stand until Allies would reach our western borders. Save your country from the Communist occupation!

NOTE: You have 30 DHs. Hold 7 VHs for BV/DV, 6 for V and 4 for TV/MV.
