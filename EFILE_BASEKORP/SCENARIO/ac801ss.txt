Good day Herr General!

Let me welcome you to my cause to unite the Polish-Germans back to the Fatherland!  

You will join my German forces here, in Prussia, to breakthrough the Polish defenses at Mlawa!  We must act quickly to enable a rapid march to encircle Warsaw.

STAFF INTEL: The poles should show stubborn resistance at fisrt, but once we break through the front lines we should be able to move quickly to our objectives.
