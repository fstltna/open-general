Die Brücken von Remagen II 

(Instructions for the Wehrmacht see below)

Well, lieutenant Hartman, listen up and follow my orders to the letter, or this mission will turn into a disaster.

1. The situation:
Several splinter groups of the German 7th army are still present West of the Rhine and are trying desperately to reach the bridge at Remagen. We raided it from the air, but don't know how much damage we did. Parts of General Patton's XII. Corps currently try to cut off the Krauts fleeing from the South West.

2. Your mission:
a) Take a reinforced recon unit and run like hell to assess the situation at that bridge.

b) Be sure to use the main route West, even though there could be German ambushes waiting along it.
Any such pockets will have to be cleared and occupied for sure!

c) Telegraph a report the moment you get there. If the bridge is intact, we'll immediately dispatch the remainder of the  8th Armored Division, to support you.

d) The bridge, including the Eastern approaches, MUST be secured by late March 7, otherwise we could count on German reinforcement!

e) Additionally, the city West of the bridge has to be secured and totally cleared of enemy pockets, to make sure that our bridge posts don't get into a pincer position!

f) Of utmost importance: under no circumstances can we permit the enemy take our support base!!!


Good luck, Lieutenant!
----------------------
Major Krueger, I hereby appoint you the combat commander of Remagen!

1. The situation:
The bridge at Remagen is the last hope to savely withdraw our brave 7th army across the Rhine.
Surely the Americans will try to prevent that.

2. Your mission:
a) Hold the Eastern end of the bridge and prevent the enemy to get a foothold there with eveything you have! By orders of the Fuehrer this is THE most important bridge in Germany and will decide Victory or defeat in this war.

b) Should American spearhead forces get to the Eastern shore, throw them into the Rhine and retake their positions!

c) I regret that I can only give you a minimum of troops for the defense of the bridge.
However, you may count on the arrival of our comrades from the 7th army, which will be under your command as well.

d) In case you or the 7th army additionally succeed in cutting off American supply lines, victory is our's!

Good luck, Major!
