Reims

Mar 26th, 1919

Despite your victory at Saint-Mihiel, the siege of Verdun and the fall of Nancy, the French have recovered incredibly quickly. Many enemy divisions have rushed to the front and somehow they've managed to slow our advance along the Marne. If we don't react, another stalemate seems likely. We'll have to improvise, try something different.
The OHL has decided that you'll launch a new attack on French positions near Reims. Last year, during the Great Western Offensive, we had to retire from Laon and most of the Aisne Valley in order to avoid unnecessary losses. The French had to pay a terrible price for their advances, and one year later they haven't been able to defend the new line properly. Their forces are too overstretched due to the heavy losses and the need to send reinforcements to the Marne, so we think that an attack of your elite troops is likely to succeed. The French won't be able to close a second gap on their lines.
