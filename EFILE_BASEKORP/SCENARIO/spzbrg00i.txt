Spanish Expedition

Part 1/4 of the "Blitzkrieg" minicampaign


So, Oberst says that the Reds' strength is vastly depleted, yet so is ours. Hence, both sides can't do much more than hold the nest defenses around the bridges. The situation is unsustainbale and must be solved before the enemy gets reinforces. We'll cross the bridges... hier und... ja, hier! It shouldn't be too hard, because the rebels seriously  lack men and their companies are mostly reduced to strengthened platoons at the very best. Our only concern are those annoying tanks of them. Scouts' reports are uncertain, but at least one three-vehicles platoon was spotted en route, while other machines were uncovered by the air support. Lets assume that the Reds may press six or seven tanks into service.

Hauptmann Bistroff, your task is the most important. You must support the river crossing and make sure that our kameraden get through. Silence any resistance, namely the deadly MGs and once we'll found the enemy tanks, engage and destroy them.


Victory conditions: Capture all VHs.
