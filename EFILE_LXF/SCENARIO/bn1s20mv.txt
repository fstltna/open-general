General Wilhelm List

Well, General! You repulsed all attacks and held your bridgehead. Unfortunately we could not secure the oil fields of Baku and the front line across the whole Caucasus is hopelessly overstretched. We must give up Batumi and withdraw our forces. You are being transferred to Greece to prepare for an operation in the Mediterranean area.
