50 B.C. : Mare Nostrum

Our old enemy, the best Roman general, Pompey Magnus, has managed to embark some Veteran legions from Spain ..... 
our spies report that a legion has already landed directly in front of us, and even more are just before the landing ....

[The Supreme druid approaches towards you:] 
Pompeius will try to put his legions ashore behind our back ..... we should prevent this under all circumstances .....

.... good, that we now have access to the Etruscan fleet and artillery ...
