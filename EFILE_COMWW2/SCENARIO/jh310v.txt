Excellent performance, Herr General.  The conquest of Cairo and the Suez Kanal should now be easy, especially for Feldmarschall Rommel.  Since we're expecting the Bolsheviks to launch a great offensive in the Kursk region, while Feldmarschall Paulus is still unable to break out of Stalingrad, the General Staff has decided that you and your men are to be transferred back to the Russian front where you have performed so well in the past.
