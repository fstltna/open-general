HQ 1st Parachute Army, France
General Kurt Student

General, after the failure of the Allied invasion in France we have information about a renewed landing attempt in Spain or Portugal. We will forestall that with an attack on British Gibraltar. With our newly developed controllable parachutes and Storm gliders, an airborne assault should possible. Our troops do not need to over-fly neutral Spanish territory. Nevertheless, we should expect an Allied reaction against Spain after our attack on Gibraltar. In this case, Franco has assured us his support. Good luck, General!
