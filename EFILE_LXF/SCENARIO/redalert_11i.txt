Combined British and German forces have managed to penetrate the ring of Soviet defense surrounding Volgorad. This city is crucial to our overall plan, which is to flank Moscow and attack it from the south where the Soviet defenses are the least ready for a large-scale attack. The formidable and determined Soviet forces will give you a tough fight, Commander. Use the experienced German forces as you will, and keep in mind we've sent one of our own naval flotillas to help you. Take the city, and liberate the oppressed Soviet people.
