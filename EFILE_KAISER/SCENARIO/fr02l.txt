Madagascar Expedition - Tsarasoatra - June 29th, 1895 - BV

Colonel Bertaux-Levillain, you have defeated the Hova army. The Malagasy troops are fleeing the battlefield. They could not withstand the firepower of your brave men. Now the road to Antananarivo is wide open. There is no force left to stop us making this country a full French protectorate!
