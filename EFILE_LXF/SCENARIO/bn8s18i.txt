THE STORY

Just before 9 am on May 14, a significant force of mostly NDH units with some Montenegrin People's Army and Slovenian Home Guard troops approached Partisan positions at the Surnik farm near Poljana demanding free passage west. This was refused, and firing commenced on both sides. NDH attacks, including artillery fire support, intensified in the afternoon, evening and overnight, finally ceasing on the morning of 15 May with the arrival of around 20 British tanks. Tense negotiations followed, during which British officers made it abundantly clear that they would not offer protection to the collaborators and that unconditional surrender to the Partisans was the only option. White flags of surrender were finally raised around 4 pm on 15 May.

The surrender of this last area of Axis resistance 8 days after the official end of World War II in Europe, the surrender of the Germans on Monday 7 May 1945, was the last major battle of World War II in Europe.
