Magdhaba, 22nd December 1916
-----------------------------------------------------
After defeating the Turks at Romani, the next objective for the Egyptian Expeditionary Force was El Arish. When the EEF advanced along the Sinai coast in December, reconnaissance advised that the enemy had apparently abandoned the village. So the town was captured without a fight on 20th December. A few captured prisoners told our interrogators that the garrison was heading inland along the Wadi el Arish.

Our troops, including the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade and 3rd Light Horse Brigade, have pursued the Turks to the tiny village of Magdhaba. The enemy position consists of a number of strong redoubts and a few connecting trenches, and is defended mainly by 80th Regiment, 27th (Arab) Division.

The Turks at Magdhaba possess the only known water in the area. It is imperative that you capture the position quickly, so that our horses can be watered. If you don't take Magdhaba during the day, our troops would have to withdraw to our wells at El Arish.
