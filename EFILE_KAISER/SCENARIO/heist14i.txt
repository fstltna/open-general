Krasnaya Gorka
June 16, 1919

Kindralmajor, there has been an urgent development on the Gulf of Finland.  As you may be aware, the Soviets have successfully salvaged the bulk of their Baltic Fleet from Helsinki last year.  They have since solidly fortified the southern shore of the gulf with anti-shipping bunkers and docked dreadnoughts.  The system of defensive installations culminates with the island-fortress of Kronshtadt, just a few kilometers west of Petrograd.

The two key fortresses on the mainland-Krasnaya Gorka and Seraya Loshad'-have denied us and the British fleet any access further into the gulf.  However, a mutiny at Krasnaya Gorka gives us a unique opportunity to crack the Soviet defense.  Although we cannot hope to capture the fortresses (they are too far behind the front line), we have decided to evacuate the mutineers and to do as much damage to the installations as possible.

Your mission is to prepare 8 battalions for a purely amphibious operation.  You are to capture the two roads that lead to the fortresses.  This is necessary for demolition and evacuation operations to succeed.  The Soviets have had plenty of time to repair their fleet, so expect a desperate fight by the Red Navy.
