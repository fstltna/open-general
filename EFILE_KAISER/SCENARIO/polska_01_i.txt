Winter warfare

December 1st, 1914

The first month of the Great War was not lucky for Austro-Hungary or for the Polish cause. The Austro-Hungarian HQ sent a lot of divisions to screen the German homeland from the Russians while the German army focused on France - without success. The famous Tannenberg battle was a tiny battle in comparision to the battles of the Kaiserliche and Konigliche Armee. The price of Austro-Hungarian sacrifice was high and the Russians continued to push forward. In such conditions the Polish uprising was a failure. In fact there was no uprising at all.

KuK HQ decided to create an independent Legiony Polskie (Polish Legions). Their soldiers were mainly volunteers from the Russian-occupied Kingdom of Poland. The eastern brigade of the Legion fought in the Eastern Carpathian Mountains while the western brigade of Legiony, once Pilsudski's forces and still under his command, fought near Limanowa.

Victory conditions: Relieve the defending Landsturm. Push the enemy out of the mountains. Take all VHs. 1st infantry unit must survive.

Intelligence report: Cossacks are everywhere and supported by weak infantry and defectors from the  KuK 26 IR. Enemy artillery is likely to arrive later. KuK airplanes can spot the enemy but their efficiency will be doubled if sappers can build an airfield. The most distant VH is a really hard nut to crack and only soft and weak reinforcements are expected so it will be a tough fight.

Your core was just augmented by an artillery unit. Infantry units should trade old Werndl rifles for modern Mannlichers. Another infantry should be purchased.

Prestige given at the start of the battle can be used for refitting. The same amount of prestige will be available if chances for brilliant victory will be lost. 

Good Luck!
