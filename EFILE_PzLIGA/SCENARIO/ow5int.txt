Herr General, the way to Lillehammer it won't be easy. Altough we're on Spring, the inland an North of Norway is covered by the snow, the mountains make it more hard too, the enemy will use that mountains for defensive things. You may take an important comunications center in the mountains too. We expect allied presence in the area.
