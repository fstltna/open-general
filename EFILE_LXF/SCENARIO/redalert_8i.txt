Welcome back, Commander. It's been roughly 2 months since your destruction of the Soviet submarine pen in Sweden, and almost all of Scandanavia is back under Allied control. However, your next assignment is far from the Scandanavian region, in the vicinity of Salerno, Italy. Italy was a hotspot for much of the early war. Eventually the combined might of British and French forces pushed the Soviet forces back into the sea, making it a safe haven for Allied weapon testing. The Soviets have learned of a very important development in our tests going on here at Salerno, however, and have landed a sizeable force to stop our development process.

This cannot happen, Commander. The weapons being tested here are crucial to our survival against increasingly well armed Soviet forces. Your job is to reinforce the badly beaten garrison of our base to the north, then to retake the area from the cowardly bastards. 

Good luck Commander. You'll bloody well need it.
