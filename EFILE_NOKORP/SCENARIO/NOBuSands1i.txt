All right Generalmajor, we need to take advantage of that victory and capture as much land as possible before the British can regroup and counterattack. We need you to capture at least Sidi Barrani and the adjacent airport.

Ah yes, that force we were talking about is still in preparation, so in the meantime you will have to do with your own means (and of course the Italian troops).



Insturctions: Take al VHs. You command your troops and the Italian auxillaries.
