11. DALMATIA (18 February 1943)

TO: Admiral
SUBJECT: Operation Weiss

---The fronts are pretty much stable. Germany is able to hold its enemies where they are. On the Balkan, however, there is frequent and well organized partisan action. The Italian and Croatian forces are not able to control their territories. In order to pacify the area of Bosnia and Hercegovina in Yugoslavia, the Axis will perform a full scale anti-partisan action code-named Operation Weiss.

While there will be massive action on the ground, the operation will also contain the clearing of enemies on the numerous Dalmatian islands lying before the coast. The British Royal Navy has problaby sent some submarines to the area and mined important sea lanes. We are unsure if there is activity by the US Navy as well. Your Marine Corps will have to capture a number of vital islands and perhaps assist the Axis army on the mainland.---

NOTE: You will not be able to deploy naval units in this scenario. You can deploy ground units but you will have manually to embark them on the "Port Embarking Hexes" near your supplyhex.
