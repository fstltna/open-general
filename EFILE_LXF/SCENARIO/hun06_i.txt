General, regarding your previous performance, Governor Horthy chose you to lead the 3rd Corps of the 2nd Army. You will join the Heeresgruppe Süd and will participate in the new major German offensive codenamed Fall Blau. Push back the Bolsheviks behind the Don River and take Voronezh and all key cities in the area. You will be supported by the German 4th Panzer Army.

HQ has approved the expansion of your forces to include a Flak detachment.

HINT: German equipment is available, upgrade your core. Who knows when Wehrmacht will give us anything again. You have got an auxiliary "Construction" unit which is good for repairing blown up bridge and building airfield.

HINT: A German reinforcement is coming from South-East. AI gets notable reinforcement too.

NOTE: You have 25 DHs. Take all VHs!

RULE: All supply lines are used by Wehrmacht, the High Command can send you only a limited reinforcement: the default strength of new units in the next scenario will be only 8 SP.
