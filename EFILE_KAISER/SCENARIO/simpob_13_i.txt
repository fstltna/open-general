The Black Baron: Saratov

November 13th, 1919

The battle for Saratov was finally coming. The Bolsheviks had fortified the city, knowing that its defences were all that stood between Denikin's Armed Forces of Southern Russia and us. However, they had been forced to retire many units from the Volga, in order to defend Moscow. In October, Denikin's generals had finally crushed the Red Army in Orel, and they were approaching Tula. Lenin and his henchmen had motives to reinforce the capital of Russia.

Our plan consisted in attacking Saratov from three sides. We would come from the north, a small group of cossacks from the east, and part of Denikin's forces from the south. They were commanded by Baron Piotr Wrangel, one of the best generals of the AFSR. It was unlikely that the Soviets could stop us.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.

Special notes:
- From now on, you may buy equipment from the Cossack Hosts in every scenario.
- Be careful with the Soviet attacks against your starting position.
