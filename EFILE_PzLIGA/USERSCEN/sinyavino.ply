Sinyavino 

The Red Army launches a major attack into the 'bottleneck' of land south of Lake Ladoga that cut off Leningrad from the rest of the USSR.

In this scenario, the Russian objective is to break through the German defenses west of Gaitolovo, capture Sinyavino, exploit the attack toward Shlissel'burg, and link up with the Leningrad Front at Moskovskaya Dubrovka.
The German objective is to hold all key-points on the isthmus, and win a bridgehead on the eastern banks of the Chernaya River at Gaitolovo.
