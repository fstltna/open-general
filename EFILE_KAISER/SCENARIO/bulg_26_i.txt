Solun

September 28th, 1918

Here we are, ready for our final blow against Solun. If we take the city, it's very likely that France and Britain will grant us acceptable peace terms. Of course, they could send wave after wave of reinforcements until they destroyed us, but the point is that they think that Bulgaria and the Balkans aren't really worth the effort. In a few weeks they'll achieve a total victory in the west against Germany, and they won't be willing to lose more men and resources in what they see as a remote region of Europe. If we press them hard enough, they'll force Serbia and Greece to accept a reasonable armistice.
That doesn't mean that taking Solun will be easy. The Entente has gathered all the remaining troops it has in the area, and they'll have some support from the Royal Navy. On the other hand, your units will be flanked by our 4th Army. I wish you luck, the destiny of our nation depends on you.

Victory conditions: Take all VHs.
