14 scenarios

Armored combat! Everybody agrees that Germany and Russia had the best land hardware.
Do you want to take that hardware for a spin in a what-if campaign featuring a German attack on the USSR in 1945, instead of 1941?
After 4 years of intense preparation on both sides, operation Barbarossa would had looked quite different: Both would have gathered piles of their best equipment, resulting in a true clash of the titans.


Difficulty:
Master *


Historical background:
Spring of 1945: Despite recurring but easily defeated allied bombing raids, Germany is at the summit of its force. Equipment and supplies have been stockpiled for 4 years in an attempt to avoid Napoleon's fate. A modern army, 40 times bigger than the one which invaded France, is ready to pounce towards Moscow. What could possibly go wrong?...



Hints:
You're going against a well-entrenched adversary having equipment as good as yours (if not better): Be careful if you want to keep your core units alive and see them grow in experience.
At some point you will be given an unique, very powerful unit. Keep in mind that if you lose this unit, the war is over for you: High Command doesn't like people who waste extremely expensive, unique resources.


* Difficulty rating:

"Master" means that a player needs to avoid making any tactical errors if he wants to score BVs. Bad weather could also render some BVs impossible.
