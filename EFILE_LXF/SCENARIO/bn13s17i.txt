
BIR HAKEIM - 5 JUN 1942

In May 1942 Rommel launches his attempt to break the Gazala line and capture Tobruk, an effort that is ultimately successful and pushes the Allies all the way to El Alamein. You have been placed at the southern end of the Gazala Line in a defensive position centered around the fort of Bir Hakeim, which is almost at the limit of the area of the desert suitable for armored operations. You must hold out as best as you can with the limited resources available.

Your men are right in the path of a number of other Italian and German Divisions, including the famed Afrika Korps, and survive the initial attacks on May 27 and you have been under constant attack since then, but now an offensive is being planned to dislodge you. You must hold out as long as you can.

GOAL: Hold 5/4/3 VH's for a BV/V/TV!

NOTE: YOU ONLY HAVE LIMITED DEPLOYMENT IN THIS SCENARIO!
