That's it. The German Spring Offensive is finally over. They haven't been able to achieve any of their goals, not only here, but all along the front.

Now it's time to turn the tables on them. Tomorrow we'll join the French troops of Général Mangin and will launch a counteroffensive. In a few weeks we'll retake Soissons and the front will be at the Aisne again. We'll need you there, so get ready.
