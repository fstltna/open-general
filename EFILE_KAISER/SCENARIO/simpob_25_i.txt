Once we were here: The Ice March (II)

January 27th, 1920

There was no time to lose. Although the Allied representatives in Siberia had told the Czechs to safely escort Kolchak to Vladivostok, when they ascertained that the Bolsheviks would oppose resistance, they quickly turned Kolchak over to the Political Centre. That's how the Socialist- Revolutionaries in Irkutsk called themselves. Of course, we all knew that the Czechs would do that.

As you can imagine, the Centre was as useless and weak as the old Komuch. After just a few days they surrendered to the Bolsheviks, who were the ones who had Kolchak at the end of January. They would kill them if we couldn't rescue him first. Then we'd have to flee to the Baikal. If we managed to cross it, we'd be relatively safe.

We didn't know what to expect in Irkutsk. There were Bolshevik troops and Socialist militias. Both of them would be hostile to us. As for the Czech units that were roaming along the railroads, I wasn't sure if they'd be willing to attack us, but we didn't trust them. Finally, the Siberian cossacks were opportunistic scum, but I doubted that they'd dare to fight against us.

Victory conditions:
- Go to Irkutsk, free Kolchak and take him to the EH at Bolshoye Goloustnoye (40,19).

Special notes:
- You can deploy only 11 ground units.
- This is a fictional scenario. Historically, Kappel died before reaching Irkutsk, and Kolchak was killed a few days later. When they received the news, the Kappelites decided to bypass the town. They crossed the frozen lake Baikal, where many of them died. Finally, the survivors reached Chita, where they could be evacuated to China.
