Iwo Jima

February, 1945

Konichiwa. I have heard about your actions in the Pacific, but your task here will be completely different. As you know, Iwo Jima is our most important base in the Bonin Islands, and nowadays this volcanic island is currently threatened by the proximity of the enemy fleets. This time, you can't leave the island, the Emperor expects the best from you if finally the enemy disembarks here. Eliminate them, or, otherwise, die as the samurai you are, that's your mission. Think on our valiant kamikazes, their mission is to get a glorious death striking the enemy!.

Prepare a line in the North, and then, try to counterattack the enemy forces, and don't forget to protect the volcano! (Mount Suribachi).

[Defensive Scenario Info]: High Command wants you to resist until the bitter end if possible. Hold 10 VHs until the end of this scenario to get a Brilliant Victory, 8 to get a single Victory, and 5 to get a Tactical Victory.
