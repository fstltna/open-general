If this victory against the British has taken place just three months ago we might have had a chance to destroy Roberts's army and convince the British to sign a negociated peace. Now it's too late, we have vey few soldiers left.

From now on we'll adopt guerrilla tactics. We won't confront the Rooineks on the open field. We'll attack small columns, destroy telegraph and railway lines, assault British positions by surprise and, in general, do our best to harass them. We'll make them pay a great price for having occupied our lands. So high that maybe, eventually, they'll go away and leave us alone.
