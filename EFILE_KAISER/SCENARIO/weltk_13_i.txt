Karfreit

Oct 24th, 1917

Despite our victories in Russia the Austro-Hungarian Army is on the verge of collapse. If we don't help them quickly, I'm afraid that the Italians will force them to surrender in a matter of weeks. So you'll have to go to the rescue of our allies again.
Last month we found a point at the Isonzo Valley, near the town of Karfreit, where you could put the infiltration tactics into practice. First we filled the area with poison gas and after that it was the time for an artillery bombardment until the first line trenches were destroyed. Now your turn has come. Your troops will have to drive into the Italian rear without even caring to secure their flanks. Remember that you must surround the enemy and control the lines of communications. That's the key to victory.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.

Special note: You can buy Austro-Hungarian equipment in this scenario.
