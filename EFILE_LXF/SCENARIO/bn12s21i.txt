
HAWAII - 24 DEC 1943

North off Oahu Island, Hawaii
CO Admiral Soemu Toyoda

With the occupation of the largest naval base outside of the United States we will win full control of the Pacific and make a promising attack on our position as good as impossible. Oahu is defended by three infantry divisions and the Americans have the remains of their Pacific fleet gathered here, including some battleships. However, their air force is weakened and this is our chance. For this operation an additional army division, four fleet carrier and our strongest battleships were entrusted to you.

GOAL: Take all VHs!


BACKGROUND

The Japanese had at no time planned an invasion of Hawaii and in truth, the Japanese never had the slightest chance of successfully invading Hawaii, whether they triumphed at Midway or not. The main reason for this is the logistical ability of Japan during the Pacific War. After Pearl Harbor the hysteria surrounding a Japanese landing on Oahu must remain largely that: hysteria, grounded in the fears of a shaken public who were unfamiliar with the logistical realities of the Pacific War. Even in early 1942 with the Allies suffering defeat after shattering defeat, and the myth of Japanese invincibility at its height, the actual odds of Japan being able to assault Oahu and then go on to prowl the west coast of the United States were practically nil.
