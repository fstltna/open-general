You've defeated the French so quickly that we'll have time to consolidate our positions before they can counterattack. Thanks to you this part of the front will be safe for many months, maybe for years.
This victory has called the attention of the OHL, and it's been decided that you and your men will be transferred to the Belgian border, where your skills are badly needed. Good luck, General, you'll need it on your new destination.
