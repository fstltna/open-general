The Alava Front

Orders from: Pamplona (Navarra), December 1936

Mi general, debo de comunicarle que.  The Republicans have begun attacking our positions at Alava and northwards to Vitoria.  Their main goal is to cut our lines and then attack Vitoria.  This will be very serious if don't take care of it now.

Most of the attacking units are composed of Basque battalions.  We expected this attack from the East via the Mondragon Valley.  Headquarters doesn't think the Basque troops will be able to hold the lines they have established.  Unfortunately at that location we are not prepared to stop their offensive.  So you are ordered to deploy your troops in Alava and stop the enemy offensive as soon as possible.  One more thing, we have numerical air superiority thanks to our German friends, but as you have seen the Republican flown soviet planes are superior to the German planes.  Use your air power carefully.
