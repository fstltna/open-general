Messines Ridge 

June 7, 1917

"Gentlemen, we may not make history tomorrow, but we shall certainly change the geography." - Gen. Plumer.

Part of the Allied 3rd Ypres Offensive - aimed at destroying the German army group in Belgium - the battle for Messines Ridge was a meticulously crafted operation by the British Gen. Plumer.  Commanding high ground south of the Allied-held Ypres salient, the Messines Ridge was the primary obstacle of the offensive.  In preparation for the operation, 8000m of tunnels were dug by the British under the German positions, and 21 mines were laid.

After 4 days of artillery preparation, 19 of the mines detonated - killing 10,000 German soldiers instantly.  The explosion was the loudest man-made disturbance in history and was audible in Dublin.

Releasing a creeping barrage upon the devastated German positions, the Allies broke through and withstood violent German counter-attacks from June 8th - 14th, by which time the Germans lost posession of the entire Messines salient.
