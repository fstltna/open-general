*****

Once the Czechoslovaks replenished their losses, offensive actions of the 1st Czechoslovak Army Corps were renewed. On 19th January Czechoslovaks captured Bardejov and on the next day Kosice was in Soviet hands.

Advance through Slovakia proceeded until 1th February 1945 when Czechoslovaks reached the gates of Liptovsky Svaty Mikulas.

Intelligence and reconnaisance: Units of XXIX Army Corps hold the Slovak cities on road to the west. The 320th Infantry Division is entrenched in Liptovsky Sv. Mikulas and on the approaches to the city. Enemy units are mostly infantry, but they still have several armoured vehicles at their dispostion and lots of artillery.
Kosice is held by Hungarian soldiers and several airplanes start from the city's airfield.

Reinforces: Nearly none...

Hint: Enemy units are placed mainly in the cities. However, speed of your advance will be hindered by harsh terrain and ground conditions. Garrison of Liptovsky Sv. Mikulas is quite strong!

Victory conditions: Capture all VHs.
