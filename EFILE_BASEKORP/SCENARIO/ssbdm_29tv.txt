"Commander Isddorr,what should We do now" the Fraus out of ammunition asked."Get Your pretty asses up,and take off.You don't want the Slav's slobbering all over them.I've got 8 Stick Grenades,I'll wait here for those Bastard Red Horse soldiers and do what I can,give them a Good Frauland welcome.Now get the Hell out of here".The Fraus cut out leaving behind everything but their uniforms and SS/BdM daggars.Hellbumahr Isddorr lit a cigarette and enjoyed a puff or two.She reached in the bag laying the grenades in front of Her,kept counting them as if by a miracle the next count there would be more.Didn't matter,8,10 a 100.Ivan's Horse soldiers were coming in mass and Poor Little Isddorr as the Fraus who just took out like lightning would not see tomorrow's Sun rise.So this was the End,nothing Special about it.Maybe a Prayer could do something?Rubbish. God or whatever had got Hellbumahr to here while Others had fell many times before.A lot of them prayed on their knees til they bled,still did not save them.Oh to be back in the Frauland Hellbumahr thought.Noise of approaching horses heard,Hundreds if not a thousand."Well My time has come,hope Your happy My Fuhress" Hellbumahr told Herself.The horses came over the hill.Hellbumahr stood up and tossed a Grenade.Later She woke up.Alone She looked around.Not an Ivan in sight.Puzzled She just stayed put for a few days.Panzers arrived. Isddorr survived,those who ran cut to pieces.
