* This file allow to configure global efile options
* This will be loaded first, and campaign.cfg will be loaded after if found
* so campaign.cfg can override any global efile setting
*
* Each option is defined by a name and equal sign and a numeric value.
* For logical put 1 for Yes and 0 for No
* this is a sample file using default options, so no need to copy if nothing is changed
* -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

no_lose_transport=1
* avoids losing transport when transport can't enter hex to move (0..1)
* default disable (you will be asked to lose transport if it cannot enter hex to move)
* Set 1 to enable (transport will move with unit same than Pg2 did)
* Pg2Mode always set this option to 1 (don't lose transport)

flak_ex2=1	
* 0 to disable, 1 make flaks protect adjacent units attacked by planes from any adjacent hex

sh_pg1=0
* 0 to disable, 1 allow upgrading in SH at any time (like PG1 did).
* This setting works only for standalone scenarios, not in campaign mode

build_cost = 120,240,80,60,80
* Can define specific cost to build: Bridge, Airport, Port, Fort, Station

trigger_ex=0 
* default, only enemy units can activate triggers
* 1 = all units can activate triggers regardless owner

allow_pontoon_ex=1
* When set >0, cost to cross a river using pontoons is the same than using a bridge (road cost only)

flak_range=4
* Default all flak-type actions are limited to range 1
* Can set a different air-defense range for flaks to >1 

g2a_intercept_mode=2	
* values are bitwise, so can be added to sum up options
* 0, default, hidden AD/Flaks can intercept in range 1 if hidden.
*    AD/Flaks can do air-defense (after itercepting) if friend units in range are attacked
* 1, AD/Flaks CANNOT do air-defense after iterceptiong
* 2, AD/Flaks can also intercept if plane finish movement in range 1.
