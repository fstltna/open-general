Batalla de Brunete

July 6th, 1937

No tiene usted calor, general?. With this horrible heat, there is no any fly flying out of there, but, what?, the Republicans have launched a powerful attack agaisnt our positions Westwards to Madrid. The newly formed enemy ''People's Army'' is smashing our defenses on Brunete!.

General Franco have called the Navarra brigades from the North Front  to stop the enemy attack, so you will receive good reinforcements, also from our German and Italian allies.

Your task is clear; defeat the Republican advance and restore our lines at any costs!!!.

Buena suerte.
