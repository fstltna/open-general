 VICTORY
--------------------------------
Congratulations, General! Our whole Agagia operation has been a 'model of desert warfare', leading to the destruction of the Senussi force, the capture of its leader Jaafer Pasha and his staff, and the relief of Sidi Barrani. The remnants of the enemy have retreated 50 miles west, to Sollum. We are ordered to follow up and strike again, quickly...
