General,

You deserve a promotion! You have managed to completely stop the German advance and eliminate the created bridgehead in a fast and brilliant counterattack. The German 56th Division has suffered heavy casualties. 

Le Chef d'Etat-major général de l’armée (EMGA).

Historical note:

In reality, and contrary to other German bridgeheads (e.g. Ronsele), Belgians were not able to recover the lost ground and could only temporary stop the German Army. Other attacks were repelled in the area and indeed heavy losses were inflicted to the Germans.
