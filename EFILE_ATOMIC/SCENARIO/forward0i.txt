Battle at the Chalchin Gol
Welcome, Herr General. You are facing the 6. Japanese army. The Japanese have passed the Chalchin Gol. Your mission is to put the enemy over the river.
Your troops:
We have chosen some troops for you. You will have six different troops, each of them is of another class. And you are able to order more units in a recent scale.  Keep in mind that your decision can be important in coming battles.
Enemy troops: 
The 6. Japanese army have only a few tanks and very few air support. The Japanese are worn out. They have no rail connection, so they are certainly not able to relieve their troops.
Sgn Major Heinz
