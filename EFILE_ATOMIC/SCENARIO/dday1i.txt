ORDERS: 

It is D-Day+12. We were able to establish beachheads alonge the whole coast from Utah beach in the west to Sword beach near Caen in the east. Paratroopers landed on the Cotentin pensinula and our ground units already reached the western coast and cut off the germans on the peninsula. Your objective is now to capture the city and port of Cherbourg. The germans declared Cherbourg a fortress and it seems that they are willing to fight and won't surrender. 

General, take your men and clear the whole Peninsula, then attack Cherbourg. Intelligence reports that there are two defence lines. The outer defence line is located few miles out of the city, while Cherbourg itself is heavily fortified. More german units are dispersed across the peninsula. You should not wait for naval support. The waters are heavily mined and High Command is unwilling to risk precious capital ships. Leave now, start the engines! Good luck!

A few hints: 

We enjoy complete air superiority and don't expect any german Luftwaffe planes.
Intelligence reports that the german forces are composed of 3 Infantry divisions with some smaller units attached. The german tank force is quite small.

You may deploy your paratroopers at sea in the east. It is recommended to buy a recon bomber or fighter.
