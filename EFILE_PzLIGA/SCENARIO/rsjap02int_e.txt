Okinawa

April, 1945

After your success at Iwo Jima we hope you can also stop the enemies here, in Okinawa. The High Command have planned the defence of the island in this way; our most important facilities are positioned in the South corner of the island, including some airstrips and the important Naha naval base. The main objective is to protect that part, focusing your efforts in holding the lines agaisnt the enemy strikes and landings using the hills and cities present there.

We have recruited an special division in Okinawa, (the ''boeitai'') plus some auxiliary units too. Also, the Yamato group is coming from Japan with fuel for just one way, to aid you with smashing the enemy fleet. Make good use of your brave kamikaze warriors, they can inflict severe casualities upon the enemy warships.

The Riukiu islands must not fall into the enemy hands!.
