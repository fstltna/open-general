Attack on the Plei Me Camp

October, 1965

Chao buoi sang comrade. As you know, in the central highlands near to the town of Pleiku, a couple of years ago the Americans constructed a so-called advanced combat base. Your task is to attack and take the camp. To undertake this mission your command will be split into two groups. The northern group must cut the national road and take one of the villages close to the road.  The southern must attack the camp, which it's currently garrisoned by irregular and Montagnard pro-Saigon militia troops.  Obviously it should not be too hard to take. Of course, some kind of retaliation from the Americans dogs is expected, so be careful.
