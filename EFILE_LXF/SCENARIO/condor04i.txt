Teruel - The frozen battle - December 15th, 1937

Herr Oberstleutnant, cancel all preparations for the upcoming attack on Guadalajara immediately! The Republicans have surrounded the provincial capital Teruel. The fall of Teruel would deal a blow to Nationalist moral. The Condor Legion is one of the first units sent to the rescue of the trapped Nationalist 52nd Division. 

ORDERS
Keep Coronel Domingo Rey d'Harcourt alive and do not lose the VH of Teruel.
