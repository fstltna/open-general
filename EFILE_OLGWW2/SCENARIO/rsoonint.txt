Back to Rangoon

Apr, 1945

With the renewed allied offensive, the enemy and the front lines have finally reached the sector where your troops are deployed. As you know, most of our units here in Burma have been destroyed. This is our last stand to stop the allied advance, before to hurry up and go back into Thailand, and that is a plan which won't like to the Emperor.

[Defensive Scenario Info.]. The High Command will only considere this as a Brilliant Victory if you defeat the allies, and can capture all the mission objectives. Take just 5 objectives for a single Victory, and hold your positions with only 4 for a Tactical Victory.
