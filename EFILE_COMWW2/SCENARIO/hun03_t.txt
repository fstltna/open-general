Well, General... A sort of victory is better than a loss. But we will not win this war with mediocre performance. We are expecting the Yugoslavian government to surrender at any minute. We can extend our territory with another 11600 km2. Now we are sending you back to the mainland to reinforce your troops. We'll need you and your men for the big push on the Soviet Union. I hope you are up to the challenge.
