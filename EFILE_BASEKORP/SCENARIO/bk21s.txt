Ah Herr General, today is the day you enter the history books! You will hit the heavily defended beachs of Turkey at Gallipoli and do what the ANZAC's could not do in WW1. You must smash the Turks swiftly because your troops are needed in Russia to relieve our trapped troops there. Move quickly General, many lives depend on you!
