Charge on Antwerpen
The victory is near. Your troops are standing in the near of Antwerpen. Your mission is to eliminate the last allied troops and occupy the harbor of Antwerpen to prevent further allied reinforcements.
Your troops:
The harbor of Antwerpen is secured by several ships. You will have command over a part of our fleet. Some bombers will assist you in this fight, too. The allied hold the only airfield in this area. It could be a good idea to build a new airfield at the start of the battle.
Enemy troops:
The defenders have abandoned the area south of Antwerpen and secured it with landmines and blockings. After this line the enemy front line is not so big. In the outback the allied still have some big tanks, like the Sherman Easy Eight type. In the harbor the allied unload unexperienced tank divisions at the moment.
