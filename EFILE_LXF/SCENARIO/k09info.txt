09. TAMAN (20 August 1942)

TO: Konteradmiral
SUBJECT: Operation Blucher

---The war in Russia is lasting longer than expected and desired. While the Kriegsmarine can keep up, the Army is starting to get exhausted. The Army's goal for 1942 is to capture the oilfields in the Caucasus and capture Stalingrad near the Volga River. To support the advance into the Caucasus, the Kriegsmarine will shift small units and its Marine Corps to the Black Sea.

The Soviet Black Sea Fleet is superior to our combined Axis navy consisting of Rumanian, Italian and German ships from all sorts of classes. The Fuhrer has given orders to perform an amphibious landing behind Soviet lines at the Taman peninsula opposite of the Crimean Kerch peninsula. This landing, code named Operation Blucher, will be supported by the combined Axis Black Sea navy. All ground troops will be supplied by your Marinekorps. 

The Soviet Black Sea Fleet is in the area and can be very dangerous. Watch out when landing.---

NOTE: Like in Crete, you will not be able to deploy naval units in this scenario. You can deploy ground units but you will have manually to embark them on the "Port Embarking Hexes" near your supplyhex.
