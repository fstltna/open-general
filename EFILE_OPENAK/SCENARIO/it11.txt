OPERATION BREVITY May15 1941

Leutnant Alfred Seeboehm's signals intercept unit reports that the Tiger convoy with over 200 tanks and over 40 Hurricanes has arrived in Alexandria 3 days ago. Wavell will use that equipment in a major offensive soon.

According Seeboehm, Brigadier WHE 'Strafer' Gott is very likely to launch an attack at our positions at Halfaya and Fort Capuzzo and maybe even as far as Sidi Azeiz or Tobruk, in order to improve the starting positions of the coming British offensive.

Our mobile reserves consist of 2 Panzer battalions. The German 5th Panzer Regiment has been reduced by the spring fighting and mechanical losses, the 8th Panzer Regiment due to mechanical and shipping losses. Rather than spreading the remaining vehicles thinly to keep all four German Panzer battalions operational, Rommel has chosen to keep two full strength battalions and disband the other two until repaired vehicles become available.

ORDERS
Capture all Victory hexes. Brilliant Victory (BV) will only be awarded in turn 8 (last turn for BV).

NOTE
Only one ground unit can be deployed in this scenario.
