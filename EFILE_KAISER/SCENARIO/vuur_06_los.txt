I'm very sorry, Nonnie. Your heroic husband died four days ago, during the  battle of Donkerhoek. We had found very strong British resistance and he decided to lead a group of men to outflank the enemy and capture his cannons. He ultimately succeeded, but the shrapnel from one of the last British shots hit him, killing him instantly. We have lost one of our most capable generals, and the blow to the morale of the troops is immense. Now we must find the strength to recover from his loss.
