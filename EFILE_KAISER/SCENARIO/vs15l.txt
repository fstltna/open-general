Schlacht an der Yzer - October 1914 - L

You failed to achieve a breakthrough. And because of the flooding of the complete area around the Yzer, it is impossible to continue further offensive actions in this sector of the front. Also the attacks of 6th Army have failed to achieve a breakthrough. 

The French army is not defeated, there is a stalemate on the Western front and we need to sent more troops to the Eastern front rapidly to take pressure off our Austro-Hungarian allies that have lost Galicia to the Imperial Russian army. The von Schlieffen plan has failed.
