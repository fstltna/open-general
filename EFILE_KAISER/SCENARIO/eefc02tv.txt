TACTICAL VICTORY
--------------------------------
Finally, we defeated the Senussi, but the fight was much harder than expected. We have been able to relieve Sidi Barrani, but we failed to destroy the Senussi force completely. Their remnants have retreated 50 miles west, to Sollum. We are ordered to follow up and strike again, quickly...
