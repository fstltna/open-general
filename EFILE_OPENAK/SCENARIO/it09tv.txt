TOBRUK - THE EASTERN OFFENSIVE April 1941 - TV

Thanks to your diversion attack and your aid to the German 5th Light Division, the 5th Pz.Rgt. and 8th Mg.Btn. were saved. 

Unfortunately the Aussies pushed us back out of the perimeter in a swift counterattack. We will attack Tobruk again once the first units of the 15th Panzer Division have arrived.


Note: Only 6 ground units can be deployed in the next scenario.
