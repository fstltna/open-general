Talinn
January 2, 1919

Kolonel, you are charged with turning the tide of the Bolshevik offensive here at Tallinn.  With the Red Army troops just 30 km away from the Estonian capital, this battle is the pivotal engagement of the Estonian War of Independence.

Under your command is the Soomusrongide Kolon, which contains your 1st regiment and (still under formation) elements of Estonia's armored train fleet.  You are to requisition what armored train equipment is already available and report to the battlefield.  Once you recapture the initiative, expect more equipment to complement your Soomusrong.

To the south, the Soviet 5th Army is pushing toward Kella.  In the center, the 7th is threatening Tallinn.  Along the coast, the Soviets are sending their own armored trains along with the ChK.  Soviet partisans have subverted some Estonians to fight for their cause.  Beware of Soviet marine parties landing on the outskirts of the capital.  You are to expect Scandianavian volunteers and the British Fleet any day now.  The Republic's eyes are upon you, Kolonel!
