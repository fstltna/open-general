Madrid 1936 

After the coup d'etat of July, the Fascist columns have traveled from Africa and from the North of Spain to make a meeting in Madrid, overruning the capital. However the Rebels are too overconfident; the high morale of the citizens of Madrid and the newly created first Mixed Brigades of the People's Army will be a serious enemy to deal with.

Select your side and win the battle for Madrid!.
