You have dealt the Red Army a severe blow. Good work, Herr General.  It's time to close in on the Soviet capital. You're to lead an offensive at Novgorod on the Northern front where the General Staff wants to sever the communications between Moscow and Leningrad. Proceed with haste to your new assingment.

Good luck, Herr General
