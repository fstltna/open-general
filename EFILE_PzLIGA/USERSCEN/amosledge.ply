Alternate history-line:
August 1943. Everything has gone wrong for the Allies. Mediterranian and the Middle East are lost to the Axis, in the East the Germans have taken Stalingrad and the Caucasian oil fields. Two months ago, the Wehrmacht launched its decisive offensive at the Eastern front - on Moscow. The Soviets are screaming for help. Against better judgement, the Western Allies launch an invasion in France. In order to stay under their own air cover, the amphibious assault takes place around Calais where German defenses are the strongest. Furthermore, unknown to the Allies, German intelligence has fully briefed OB West on the upcoming invasion. Von Rundstedt has set a trap with his battle-seasoned armored forces, and swarms of U-boats and Luftwaffe fighters are awaiting the Anglo-American onslaught. Will the invasion end in bloody disaster, or will YOU lead the Allies to victory?

Special scenario conditions:
Playing the German side against the AI is not recommended; it is just to stupid for that. In a two-player game, an Allied victory is achieved as usual.
A German defender victory is achieved if and when, on their last turn, each original German victory hex is still or again under German control.
