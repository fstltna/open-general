Headquarters

December, 1941

Good morning General, what do you think of today's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor?  The Yankees were completely surprised and there fleet was severely damaged!   We will receive the war declaration from the USA in the next few hours...

You can decide your next destination; the emperor has given you this golden opportunity.  By taking the Wake Island flag, your next destination will be the attack on the US base in the Philippines.  On the other hand, if you take the Hong Kong flag, your next destination will be the South of China, with Hong Kong and Macao as your main objectives. Taking the Dutch flag, you will go to fight in the Dutch East Indies.
