05. MADAGASCAR (5 May 1942)

The British government has requested the PEF for use in an operation against the Vichy French island of Madagascar. This island is less than 200 kilometers away from our colony of Mozambique. So we do have interest in neutralizing a potential enemy - if not gaining more colonies. The British want to make sure the Japanese, who are already active in the Indian Ocean, cannot gain access to the vital island of Madagascar.

Operation Ironclad consists of an attack on Diego Suarez, the primary French base, on the very northern tip of Madagascar. The rest of the huge island will be left for what it is until the time comes. Britain will deploy its 29th Infantry Brigade which will land west of Diego Suarez. The PEF will land east of this base and together these forces will capture Diego Suarez and the countryside. The Royal Navy has send a strong flotilla to assist the troops. Furthermore carriers and carrier-based aircraft will be around. 

The French are not expected to have a large force in the area. But it is likely that the forces that are present, will resist feriously just like in the Allied attack on Dakar months ago. Good luck, General!
