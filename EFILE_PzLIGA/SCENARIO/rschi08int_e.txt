Assault on Chonqqing

Jan, 1944

After these 7 long years of war, our long awaited objective is now near; the complete conquest of China, and the unconditional surrender of all the Chinese forces.  Although we eliminated their supply lines some time ago, their new capital, Chongqing is still resisting our assaults.  Your mission is simply to take the enemy capital, without taking into account the losses; we must defeat the Chinese at all costs!
