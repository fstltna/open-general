Athen

Jun 20th, 1918

This month of June is being very good to us. East of your current positions the British forces are trapped in Thessaloniki. To the west, our reserves have expelled our enemies from the Albanian border and have reached the Adriatic Sea. In Italy our Alpenkorps is launching an attack against the Italian lines in Trient, in the hope of breaking that front just like we have done here, in the Balkans. The taking of Ahen will be the perfect ending for this outstanding series of victories.

Athen is being defended by half of the Greek Army. They've also managed to fortify the city, and they'll count with the help of a couple of French divisions that have avoided encirclement. Even more important, the Royal Navy will give support to the defenders of Athen. We've sent you some submarines and torpedo bombers from the Pola flotilla, so you won't be helpless against them, but remember to be careful anyway.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.

Special note: You can buy Bulgarian and Austro-Hungarian equipment in this scenario.
