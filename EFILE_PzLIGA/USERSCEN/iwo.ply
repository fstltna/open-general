Iwo Jima v1.1 
                               
The Japanese Army have reinforced the Iwo Jima island, a militar base in the way to the main Japan islands. The General Kuribayashi has also been sent to command the garrison of Iwo Jima, and nobody expects to seem him again in Japan. The orders are clear; follow the Bushido code, fighting until the last man, causing as many possible losses into the V Anphibious Corps under the General Holland command, deployed by the US Navy to capture the volcano island. The Japaneses have made a lot of subterrain defenses and bunkers, awaiting the Americans quietly.

As Japanese commander, you should delay the action of the American marines, causing a lot of losses, and as an American commander, your task is to capture the island, taking as many losses as possible.
