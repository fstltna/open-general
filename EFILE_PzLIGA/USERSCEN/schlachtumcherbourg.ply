Battle of Cherbourg v. 1.2

A historic scenario dealing with the combat actions of the allied forces in the framework of Operation Overlord around the Cotentin peninsula and Cherbourg from June 10 to June 30, 1944.

After the allied forces had consolidated their positions in the Normandy coastal area, the U.S. 1st Army pushed inland as far as to the gulf of St. Malo and thus cut off the northern Cotentin peninsula from its rear connections. The U.S. VIIth Corps moved towards Cherbourg in order to conquer the strategically important harbor.

The port of Cherbourg had been developed to the fortress. The bocage terrain favored the Wehrmacht; the LXXXIV. Korps and other encircled troops put up a fierce but hopeless resistance against the allied units.

Only after desperate skirmishes with lots of casualties the commander of the Cherbourg fortress capitulated on June 26, 1944. The last fights at the north-western edge of the Contentin peninsula ceased on June 30, 1944.
