Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam
Vietnam represents an intimidating stronghold for the People’s Republic of China in Southeast Asia and will continue to threaten the security of the Western nations until China’s power there has been neutralized. The liberation of Thailand, however, has left their southern forces in Ho Chi Minh City exposed. There is no better time for our invasion. A U.S. return to Ho Chi Minh City carries with it an importance far greater than the capture of a strategic objective: failure here could spell destruction for the Western alliance. You will begin the invasion at Phu’o’c Tho, then advance north and west to secure the roads and take Ho Chi Minh City.
