Irkutsk, Siberia, Russia
The capture of Almaty was the first step towards the reconquest of Siberia. The vastness of Siberian wilderness makes logistical support a critical factor in our strategy to free the Russian people and break the stranglehold that the People’s Republic of China placed upon the world. You must capture Irkutsk to secure vital supply lines along the Trans-Siberian Railroad and establish forward positions at Maloye Goloustnoye and Baykal.
