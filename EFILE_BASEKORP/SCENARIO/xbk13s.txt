Herr General,
Here at Mogilev we will again carry out a pincer movement to encircle the strongly held city.

II Panzergruppe Battleplan:-

1. Divide your Panzergruppe in 2 Kampfgruppe.

2. Kampfgruppe North will push east and cross the Dniepr river north of Mogilev at or around the Shklov-Orsha reach.

3. Kampfgruppe South will push east and cross the Dniepr river south of Mogilev at or around the town of Stary Bykhov.

4. The 2 Kampfgruppen will meet around the Gorki-Ryasna region to close the arms of the pincer.


Player Note: You will need to capture and hold all 9 Victory Hexes on the map for a Brilliant Victory, 7 for a regular Victory and 5 for a Tactical Victory, any less than this will result in a Loss.
