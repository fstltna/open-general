There you are, Comrade General!  I have not heard from you for hours.  You were hit by an artillery shell?  Ah I see.  Nothing to worry about.  I am aftaid that you were not the only one, Comrade General.  Let me inform you about the general situation.  Over the entire front the communist armies have thrown the capitalists back but at a very high cost.  Attacking on this type of terrain made us vulnerable to massed firepower from the ground and air.  Hold your current positions.  Then meet me at my headquarters.
