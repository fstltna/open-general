Not In Soviet Hands

28/04/1945

Units that were not entrapped in the Berlin area headed as fast as possible west, closely pursued by the Soviets, to surrender to the Americans and British.

Your core is split from Steiner's group (who retreats via Neubrandenburg to the Elbe). You have to find your own way to the Elbe. 
Note: There are two rivers to cross. And the Elbe you can only cross at some fords/points. You only have to capture the US-victory hexes at the other side of the river Elbe.
15 deploy hexes. New units have strength 5.
