
BERMUDA - 6 FEB 1943

Angra do Heroismo, Azores, Atlantic Ocean

The outdated and outgunned U.S. Atlantic Fleet was greatly weakened in the Battle of the Atlantic in the past months and in the Pacific, the Americans will be hard pressed by the Japanese. Now it is time to exploit this success as quickly as possible before the American rearmament and fleet build programs come to bear.
With Portugal the use of naval- and airbases in the Azores and Cape Verde was negotiated and now the big jump from the Azores to Bermuda is imminent - 3500 km to be overcome. Under high pressure, a strategic bomber fleet has raised in the last year and from Bermuda their use against the American mainland be planed.
The enemy expect our operation and the remains of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet was gathered in the area of Bermuda. Therefore, your landing troops are accompanied by strong naval and sea air forces. But make sure that none of the valuable heavy Naval units come to harm!

Order landing troops (3 units) and your navalised air force ready for action! 

GOAL: Take all VH's and prevent that more than one of your 6 MSU's get lost!

NOTE: In this scenario, you can at scenario start only use core aircraft that can launch from aircraft carrier! Upgrade or sidegrade as many of your planes as possible to types with K-ability.

All axis nations auxiliaries are under your command.
