OUTCOME

The Legion succesfully occupied Samara and was threatening more Russian cities along the Volga. Through foreign and through White Russian eyes, the Legion was an ideal force for the counter-revolution and overthrow the Soviets. However the Czech Legion was fighting its own struggle and it only occasionally co-operated with White Russian authorities.
