OPERATION EILBOTE I January18 1943

Heavy rains turned the Tunisian battlefield into a sea of mud and combat actions came to an abrupt halt mid December last year. We received reports that British, French and US forces are preparing for an offensive with the aim of reaching the sea, cutting our forces in half and cutting the supply route to our forces opposing 8th Army. Our plan is to spoil those attacks by capturing all passes leading through the Eastern Endorsal, starting with the pass at Barrage de l'Oued Kebir, the Karachoum Gap and the Kairouan Pass: Operation Eilbote I (this scenario). We will follow up these actions by capturing the Faid and Maknassy passes (next).  

Info: Max 3 core ground units can be deployed.
