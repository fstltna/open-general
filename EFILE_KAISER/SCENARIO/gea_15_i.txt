Into Portuguese East Africa: Namacurra

The action at Negomano got Von Lettow Vorbeck some of the supplies his army badly needed, but his troops still lacked the ammunitions and medicines that would be indispensable for a prolonged resistance. Thus, he advanced deeper into Portuguese East Africa and in June 1918 the German columns were near the main town of Quelimane. There they heard rumors about huge amounts of supplies stored at Namacurra.  It was a strategic village known for its railway and vital communications with the rest of Portuguese East Africa. Von Lettow knew this was the opportunity he was waiting for and on July 1st the German attack started.

Victory conditions: Take all VHs.
