Changes from version 2.0 to 2.01 [early April 2016]:
- Minor corrections to Bougainville Campaign (a few fortification units had non-0 values set in "fuel" and "moves left" fields;
should not have affected gameplay).
- Shifting of a couple of deployment hexes in KCAMPLER.xscn (Deutsche Marinekorps Campaign).
- France changed to Free French Forces in scenarios SpzBrg15.xscn, SpzBrg16.xscn and SpzBrg17.xscn
 (Spezial Sturmbrigade "Bistroff" Campaign).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes from version 1.10 to 2.0 [end March2016]:
- Minor changes to some icons & units (name changes, etc.).
- Adjustments to start-dates, stats/properties of some Hungarian units.
- Fire support reduced to single fire support for some more of the heavier AT guns (heaviest guns already had single fire support).
- A couple of minor fixes to "No Price Too High" campaign.
- "Hungarian Royal Army" campaign had AI and other campaign settings revised.
- .cfg was having the effect of eliminating the automatic air-defence response from flak units, now corrected. (Also: ground_carrier=1.) 
- Helicopter class/movement eliminated; new movement-type: "Wagon (Horse)" created - applicable units moved.
* MAJOR CHANGE: Implemented new movemement scheme across the efile: All unit's movement and fuel settings are "doubled", with terrain-costs in TERRAINEX also doubled (but not completely: the costs for particular movement-types were slightly adjusted to allow for more realistic movement during the game - the point of the new scheme).
- For converted campaigns/scenarios: all units have had their initial fuel/movements settings doubled (also, any errors in unit settings detected while implementing these changes were corrected at the same time).
- New OPENGUI .pngs created to give in-game awareness of the new movement scheme.
- Addition of airfield hexes to a couple of scenarios in Deutsche Marinekorps Campaign (otherwise non-carrier based aircraft would run out of fuel and crash before the end of the scenario). Same also for one scenario in 22.ID Campaign.
- Jeeps and GMC CCKW trucks given all-terrain movement.
- Units 6179-6184 added.
* MAJOR CHANGE: All aircraft given recon type movement (this change may be reconsidered should adverse results/feedback warrant).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes from version 1.01 to 1.10 [March2016]:
- Shortened rail movement from 12 to 10 hexes for most rail cars, exceptions: reconnaissance cars set at 11 hexes;
	railway guns set at 5 (from 6); railway-mortars set to 8 (from10).
- Minor changes to icons & units (a few units had name changes, some received a different icon, a few minor statistic altered).
- Coastal patrol-vessels Hangers/Carrier-weight values set to 'nominal' value (to prevent their entering of containers). [nom. value = bit 16]
- All ground units had their Hangers/Carrier-weight values set to 'nominal' (no use of containers). [nom. value = bit 16]
- EQUIP.cfg created for efile:
	ground_carrier=3* (ground carriers activated: allow entrance/exit; combat support, AD and fire support.
	Note: only "ground" unit so far given a hanger is the Submarine Pen 
	(to use Submarine Pen as a hanger, place upon a Port hex). 
- Important fix to many campaign scenarios: some air units had "remaining fuel" field set at "0" and would immediately crash at start of a scenario.
- Applied Fronts/Factions to 22.ID Campaign; also fixed Infanterie to make them Air Transportable for the campaign.
- Many small changes to previously adapted campaigns: making sure briefings appear, matching embarked units to proper transports, made sure
	Typed Victory conditions were set to "on" where appropriate, setting certain campaign scenarios to visible so they could be played alone.
- Set earlier start dates for many naval transports. 
- Scenario hun10a.xscn re-adapted, made visible.
- Adated MG43's campaign "No Price Too High" for Efile.
