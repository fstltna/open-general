DEFENDING THE MARETH LINE March 1943 L

Disaster! You failed to stop the attack of XXX Corps, spearheaded by the 50th (Northumbrian) Division. There is nothing left for us but to hastily retreat to the Akarit line. 

The Akarit line formes a better defensive position than the Mareth line, but our troops arrived there in great disarray which meant that 24 hours after 8th Army's attack on the position it had to be evacuated. 8th Army has made contact with the Allied forces in North and Central Tunisia and Mussolini's Afrika Korps faith is doomed.
