I can't believe that the Serbians have defeated us again. Thank God that the Germans and the Bulgarians have taken care of the situation. Some foreigners have had to solve the problems that you caused. What a shame. What will our allies think about us if we can't get anything done? It's obvious that you need to retire. We'll find more capable officers that can replace you.
