Tomba- November, 1917 - L

Herr Oberst, please keep laid down. The doctor has said that, if you do unnecessary efforts, your wound will take longer to heal.

Your men desire you a quick recovery, but they won’t be able to visit you. They will be transferred to France, where we’ll launch a final offensive next spring. The operation in the Alps has been cancelled. The Austrians will have to fend for themselves there.

Don’t worry about your next command. In the following months you just have to rest and recover. Go back home, and spend your time with your wife. Didn’t you want that? Who knows, maybe when you’re ready for service again, the war will have already finished...
