Bregalnica - counterattack at Krivolak

July 2nd, 1913

I'm glad to see you and your refreshment troops, indeed. This new war hasn't started well for us: Our divisions haven't recovered from the losses that they suffered fighting against the Turks, so right now the Serbians have numerical superiority. They stopped our offensive rather easily, and now they are about to launch a massive counterattack against our lines.
In order to reverse the situation you must make a flanking assault against the Serbian Third Army here, in Krivolak. If you manage to cross the Vardar River and take solid positions on the opposite shore, the rest of our units could follow you and we might neutralize the Serbian right flank.
We know that the Serbian defences in the area aren't particularly strong, but you will have to deal with them as soon as you can, before they receive any reinforcements.


Victory conditions: Take all VHs.
