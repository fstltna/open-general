Welcome General, some wine? we have a lot to consider.

We are at a critical time in the Mediterranean.  We must destroy the British hold on Malta to halt their punishing attacks on our line of supply to North Africa!

A bold and aggressive attack by our air forces followed by a sweep by our ground forces should capture the island in a matter of days.

The British will surely counter your forces with every available asset, including Alexandria.  YOU can count on support from Africa.

STAFF INTEL: The RAF and RN are the biggest threats.  The ground forces are heavy with anti-aircraft so our air forces are better off helping our own naval combat.
