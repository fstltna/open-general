OPERATION EILBOTE I January 1943 L

Your troops and the hotchpotch of German troops that arrived in 1st Division's (Superga) sector were not able to take the assigned targets from the French Maroccan and French Algerian Divisions. The planned Allied offensive will continue. This will undoubtably result in the Axis troops being split. Panzer Armee Afrika cannot keep up the fight without supplies. This is the end of Mussolini's Afrika Corps!
