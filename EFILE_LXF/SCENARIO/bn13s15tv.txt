TACTICAL VICTORY

While France is crumbling under the weight of the German invasion, you have saved the honour of France!

On 22 June 1940 France will ask for an armistice and the Battle for France is over...

...but you, your men and most of your equipment are loaded onto freighters at Nice and somehow escape to Africa - where you will continue the struggle to liberate France.
