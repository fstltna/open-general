Brief to Anzac Commander.

As a reward for your brave efforts at ANZAC Cove you can now decide where you would like to fight next!! If you want to lead the ANZAC Infantry in France then you must take the Victory Hex for a Tactical Victory. If you want to lead the ANZAC Mounted Corp in the Middle East take the Victory Hex for a Victory. Whatever your decision Commander the Allied High Command wishes you the best of luck!!
