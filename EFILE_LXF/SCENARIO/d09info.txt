09. WALCHEREN (28 October 1944)

STRATEGIC SITUATION:
Early September 1944 the important port of Antwerp has been captured intact but whoever owns control of the Schelde Estuary controls what goes in and out of Antwerp. The Germans held both banks of the estuary. The Canadians have cleared the southern bank in October after bitter and ferious fights. The northern bank has only partly been cleared. The Germans have fortified the western tip of this huge peninsula called Walcheren. British Commando and Marine units will land at Vlissingen (Flushing) and Westkapelle to take out as many naval guns as possible. You alongside the Canadians will have to attack Walcheren from the east. The 155th British Brigade will reinforce the Marines at Vlissingen. Together you must take Walcheren as soon as possible so Antwerp can be used fully for the Allied cause!

TACTICAL ORDERS:
British Commando and Marine units have landed at Westkapelle and Vlissingen. They are supported by two monitors and the old HMS Warspite. The 155th British Brigade is embarking at Breskens to reinforce the bridgehead at Vlissingen. Alongside the 5th Canadian Brigade you must attack Walcheren from the east. Together we must succeed. You also need to clear some other small German positions in Zeeland so we will have full control over the Westerschelde, the Schelde Estuary, and Antwerp can finally be used!
