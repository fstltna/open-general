Great work by your XIX corps Herr General, you are now ordered to cross East Prussia and form up for our attack south-east.

The plan for "Operation Fall Weiss" called for Guderian's XIX corps to strike due south to capture Brest from starting points on the eastern border of German East Prussia. The quickest way to get his force to the starting area was a fast dash across the Polish held "Danzig Corridor" then rapid uninterrupted movement through friendly territory. It took 4 days for the lead elements of the Corps to create and hold a safe corridor through which the rest of the battle group raced to East Prussia. The 5th and 6th Panzer Regiments of the 3rd Panzer Division were to do the lions share and were awarded some of the first Iron Crosses of the war.
