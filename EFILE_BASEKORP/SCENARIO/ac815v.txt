Welcome General, a Toast!?!

Your liberation of Basarabia was well done and Romania is celebrating.

Your punch through the Russian right flank showed your troop's understanding of blitzkrieg.  The Romanian Troops lost all doubts by your example and finished off the Russians soon after.

Hitler shows his confidence in you by ordering that you join Army Group Center's drive on Moscow!

Good Luck!
