Your troops:
The 2nd Belorussian Front will assist your attack in the south and in the north. In the north the 2nd Belorussian Front should take Schwedt and fight against the 4th Tank Army. Remember, this is the last battle. You can use the massive pp for refitting if you need it.
Enemy troops:
The 9th Army, the 12th Army and the 4th Tank Army are high-experienced but worn out troops. They have some serious tank divisions with Tiger II and Panther tanks.
