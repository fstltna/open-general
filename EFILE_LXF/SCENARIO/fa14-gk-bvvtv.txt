Your performance leaves us in amazement, Tappi ('Shorty')!
You've not only held the front against all odds, but you also drove the Russians back to their starting positions. At the same time the rest of my corps was able to stop all the attacks at the Taipale sector. This ultimately ended any further threat. 
Meanwhile the Soviets are broken through at Summa and again threaten Viipuri. You must go back and assist the 2nd Corps. The danger this time is considerably bigger and you may have to lead a strong counterstrike. 

Be careful.
