BRILLANT VICTORY

However, once again the Italians failed to close the trap. Ras Kassa and his two sons, with Ras Seyum, and Dejaz Mashasha Wolde crossed the Gheva. Mangasha Yilma went a different way. What was left of the armies of Wag, Lasta, and Yeggiu had already made their own escape.

Dejaz Haile Kebbede had led their breakthrough. There was a running night battle, during which the men of Wag suffered the worst casualties they had known against the Third Corps in the valley of the Gheva. Flares dropped by Italian planes lit up the whole area. For the Ethiopians it was as if the night turned to day.
