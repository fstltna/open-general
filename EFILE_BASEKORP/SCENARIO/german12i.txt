Defense of Normandy (25 Jul 1944)
Third part of the "Defending the Reich" minicampaign.

The Normandy landings opened another front on European soil. An armoured counterattack around Saint-Lô is our last possible chance to drive the Allies back to the sea.

The orders you are getting are more and more unrealistic. Over the last weeks we've lost much ground and many men, and now we are ordered to not only stop the American onslaught, but also to move into counterattack, to recapture Saint-Lô, and ultimately destroy the enemy forces in Normandy. This is simply beyond our capabilities, so act accordingly.

The American forces launched their own offensive, Operation Cobra. We must stop an immense wave of tanks, self-propelled artillery, infantry and parachute divisions, supported by the cream of the US Airforce: the sky is covered with hundreds of fighters and fighter-bombers.

Our own support consists of scattered remains of several infantry garrisons, some Waffen-SS and Fallschirmjägers veterans and a completely outnumbered Luftwaffe pilots flying obsolete planes. Please note that there's a V1 instalment in our vicinity, so don't let this wonder weapon fall into the enemy hands.

Tip: Be really careful of the enemy planes!
