General Gerd von Rundstedt

A victory with heavy losses, Lieutenant Colonel! You underestimated the complexity of combined operations. The British mainland surrendered, but Churchill escaped to Canada and the resistance will go on from the British Commonwealth and in North Africa. You will go back to Germany for rest and refitting.
