What-If campaign based on the North African Campaign (1940-1943).
You are sent as a stand-in detachment to help the Italians while the Afrika Korps is assembled. If you prove yourself worthy, you might even get to command of the Afrika Korps yourself later on.


Difficulty:
Average *

Historical background:
It's summer of 1940. 4 days after the defeat of France, Italy enters the war hoping to claim a piece of the spoils, and also hoping to vastly extend their North African colonies. Unfortunately the British troops occupying Egypt didn't play ball: Instead of folding and going away, they proceed immediately to kick the Italians out of Africa. Germany being the ally of Italy, they reluctantly resort to sending a small detachment to help the Italian army - Under your command.


Hints:
Mobility will be the key, as you will be constantly outnumbered. Buy accordingly. Also, you often won't have air superiority.


* Difficulty rating:
Easy - Casual - Average - Master - Impossible
