Herr General: You have been designated by OKW as Chief of Operations for the Sixth Armee in our upcoming southern campaign, Operation Blue. The ultimate goal of this undertaking is to cut the Volga river lifeline and capture the oilfields of the Caucasus, thus delivering a powerful blow from which the Soviets will never recover. The 4th Panzer Armee has already begun their drive towards Voronezh. Your job is to follow suit and cover the flank while destroying any Soviet troops in your line of march...
