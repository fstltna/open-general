KAKHOVKA (20 October 1920)

That traitor Wrangel still operates like a wolf from the Crimea.  He stabbed the people's army in the back while we were occupied with the war against Poland.  Now that those reactionaries have seen that the Revolution in Russia cannot be stopped, we can muster all resources to bring peace to Russia!  Russia ruled by its people!

Wrangel has broken out of the Crimea some time ago and captured land north of the Perekop isthmus.  We can only be grateful for a foolish act like that.  His forces are now strung out and have few reserves.  The idiots aligning themselves with Wrangel's fate must now even face the Cavalry Army!

Comrade, cross the Dnjepr River near Kakhovka and quickly penetrate through the enemy lines.  Their force must not reach the Perekop isthmus before we do if we are to gain an easy victory!  The proletariat has suffered enough during the last years!
