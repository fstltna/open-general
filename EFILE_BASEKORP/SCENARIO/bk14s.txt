General you have the privilege of launching Operation Barbarossa against the Red Menace. Surprise is on our side. Destroy the Russian airforce on the ground and smash thru their weak defences. We have much ground to cover so a rapid advance would be favorable to us. First you must capture an airfield to resupply.
