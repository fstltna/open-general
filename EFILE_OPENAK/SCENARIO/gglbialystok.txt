Once again your XIX corps let us down Herr General, you are now ordered to contine south. Do not fail us again or the end of your command will come swiftly for you.

After the Battle of Wizna the XIX Corps brings up it's reserves, makes repairs and continues it's advance towards Brest, largely destroying the Polish 18th Infantry Division as it goes. At Wysokie-Masowieki, Polish troops attack the Corps headquarters while Guderian is inspecting the leading elements and debriefing the forward observers. A detatchment from the 3rd Panzer Division is sent back to deal with the Poles but finds the situation already resolved by members of headquaters staff. Little resistance is encountered at Bialystok and apart from a brief skirmish at Chiechanowiec the adavance procedes rapidly.
