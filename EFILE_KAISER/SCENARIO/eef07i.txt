First Gaza, 26th March 1917
-----------------------------------------
After a cautious advance by night - avoiding vigilant observation by German Fokker planes - we have reached the Gaza area. Hopefully, we will be able to take the garrison by surprise in the morning.

Our latest information suggests that Gaza is held by only 4,000 troops under the command of Tala Bey, and  the enemy's closest support is at Hareira, ten miles to the south-east. Against this force we will be able to field about 22,000 rifles. With this advantage in numbers and mobility, the prospect of successfully rushing Gaza before Turkish reinforcements could arrive appears exceedingly good. 

While the infantry will make a frontal attack on the positions defending Gaza, your mounted troops are ordered to strike out east and north with the double object of holding up Turkish reinforcements from the east and southeast, and cutting off the retreat of the main body should the town be taken.

Good luck, General!
