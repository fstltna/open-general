INCIDENT AT WALWAL

December 5th, 1934 (Ogaden Desert, Hararge Province, Southern Ethiopia)

At Walwal there were over a thousand wells, the biggest concentration in the Ogaden. A well was not just a hole in the ground with water at the bottom; it was and is an important piece of property.

On 23 November 1934, an Anglo-Ethiopian boundary commission, which had been surveying the frontier between British Somalia and Ethiopia, arrived at Walwal, 100 kilometers within Ethiopia. Walwal is well west of the Italian Somaliland border of the time. As early as 1928, the Italians were moving deep into Ethiopia and establishing military posts. They simply did not respect the treaties they had signed.

In 1934, the Italians had already been established at Walwal for more than 4 years. The Ethiopian force and the British survey party reached Walwal and encamped near the Italians who were controlling the wells there. They are the only source of water in the area.

The British members of the commission protested at the Italian presence, but then withdrew to Ado to avoid an "international incident". The Ethiopians on the other hand faced the Italians.

On December 5th, a shot was fired and soon a FULL-SCALE BATTLE erupted.
