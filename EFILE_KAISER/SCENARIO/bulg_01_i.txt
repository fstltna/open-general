Battle of Lule Burgas

October 28th, 1912

Despite their defeat at Lozengrad, the Ottomans hae been able to reorganize their troops very quickly. Right now, they are building a defence line between Lule Burgas and Bunar Hissar. You must attack inmediately, before they can finish their trenches and bunkers.
Although the Turk army is composed mainly of infantry units, we know that thay have at least one cavalry division in the area. Besides, our intelligenge reports confirm that a large number of Turkish fresh troops are on their way to Bunar Hissar, and they'll arrive to the battle front in a couple of days at most.

Victory conditions: Take all VHs.
