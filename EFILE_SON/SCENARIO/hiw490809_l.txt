That was a terrible defeat that couldn’t be avoided, Citoyen General. Despite a valiant defense your men are wiped out as a fighting force. The front is broken, your soldiers are running away withouth their equipments or surrender to the imperial troops. Only a few veterans fought their way through the imperial encirclement and opened a corridor to Karánsebes. The war is lost. We have left no choice but to escape to Turkey and serve our nation as refugees. I’m sure that one day, we will regain our independence. Perhaps not in our lives.
