Tarakan Invasion

January, 1942

OIL!  That's what we need, and we can get it from the Dutch colonies.  Our supplies of oil are running out, and the high command thinks we desperately need that resource.  We must secure it at all costs to maintain our war against the western powers.

To begin the conquest of the Dutch East Indies, your first mission is to seize the island of Tarakan and its supply of rich oil fields.  Do it quickly, we will soon need your services to clear other sectors.
