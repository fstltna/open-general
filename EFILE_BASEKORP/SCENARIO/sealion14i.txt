Rebellion of the Clans!

Orders:

After a quiet winter we are preparing for a Invasion of Canada. Unfortunately some Highlanders in the region of Caithness carry out guerilla attacks against the railways. We need those railroads and ports as supply bases for the Kriegsmarine base at Scapa Flow. You and your men have to find and take out every enemy guerilla unit!

Note:

You can not buy or upgrade units within this scenario and the enemy will have the first turn!
