March, 46 B.C. * Thapsus

.... After Pompey on his escape was murdered in Egypt, Quintus Caecilius Metellu Pius Scipio continued the fight of the Pompeians....
....Scipio had withdrawn into Numidia which was allied with the Pompeians....
....Caesar followed Scipio to North Africa, and put up his legions ready for battle at Thapsus: therefore Caesar believed that the hostile troops could be finally smashed; on the other Hand Caesar secured the, for the Grain sustenance of Rome, so important province....

....Caesars landing site to the north of Thapsus was a land tongue which left only place to the west and the south....
....Scipio had arrived with his legions in time, and blockaded Caesars way to the west....
.... In the south, however, Lucius Afrianius stood with his men, and the pompeian confederate, the numidian king Juba I., with his War Elephants....

....Angry about the luxury in the pompeian camp, and because Caesars troops also lacked food; the trumpet player of the Legio V blew without order to the attack....
.... Immediately Caesars men went over to the attack - Caesar mounted his horse and rode into the first row....

-" Felicitas, help me! "-
