Message from General Berenguer Fusté's HQ:


Your brilliant defence strategy has saved our army from an inminent disaster. If it weren't by you, most of our forces would have been annihilated, and even Melilla would be in great danger. Even though we have to mourn the death of brave General Silvestre, shot at Annual by an enemy sniper, this is a day of glory for the Spanish army.

But the war doesn't end here. The Berber rebellion still goes on, and now that they have a competent commander I'm afraid that things are going to become difficult.

Anyway, you have my congratulations, General. I will recommend that you have the Laureate Cross of San Fernando awarded for your heroic behaviour.
