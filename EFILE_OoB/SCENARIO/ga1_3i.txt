Good Morning General
H.Q. has decided it is time for your men to sharpen their skills, and regain some confidence. You and your men have been slated to take part in a training exercise code named "Operation Spartan". This exercise will involve ground forces only. A large area  west of London has been cleared to provide the "Battlefield". Your men, along with the Free French forces, will be known as "Force Z" and will attempt to secure a bridgehead over the river and force a breakout. "Jedburgh" units will arrive as reinforcements with specific orders, (to be made known UPON their arrival), as to which bridge is to be TAKEN and held. Also, the enemy command outpost located in the southwest at Camberley must be captured. Opposing you will be the British and U.S. forces, to be known as "Force X". This is a "live" ammo exercise, so be careful!
Good luck, General....
