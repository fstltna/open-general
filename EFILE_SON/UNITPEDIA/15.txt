The Hungarian word literally means “Ditch Infantry”.

It is a Sapper Infantry with weak attack and defense values. It has four special skills: it can act as a pontoon bridge, it can build and repair facilities, it can use rail transport (RTP) and it can attack naval targets.

Hungarian soldiers served in Sapper companies of the Austrian Army, but none of these companies stationed in Hungary before the Revolution. The organization of this special branch started in September 1848 in Pest and the important fortresses like Komárom (in West-Hungary) and Pétervárad (in South-Hungary). During the Independence War, only 8 full companies served in the Hungarian Army, but they performed very well in strengthening the existing fortifications, demolishing the besieged fortified positions or building bridges.
