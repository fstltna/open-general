3rd Ypres - Battle of Pilkem - August, 1917 - TV

Good job General. The attack of British and French forces towards Pilkem Ridge has been stopped and most of the ground lost recaptured. Our troops are in pretty good shape to counter the follow-up attacks that can be expected soon.

Historical events:
After the battle of Pilkem Ridge, British commander Haigh kept on launching more attacks North and East of Ypres throughout August, looking for a breakthrough. The results were small gains of terrain at higher and higher costs. All until the British got completely stuck after capturing Passchendaele in a final attack early November. All reserves of the British army were spent.
