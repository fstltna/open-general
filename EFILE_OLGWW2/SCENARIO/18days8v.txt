General,

Congratulations! Thanks to your defence and your counterattack the German attack has been stopped and most of the terrain previously lost has been regained.

Unfortunately, the Anglo-French offensives against the German defensive line on the Ardennes/Calais axis have failed and our Army, under pressure, has retreated further, leaving the Germans to capture Terneuzen and Gent/Gand on the 23 May.

Le Chef d'Etat-major général de l’armée (EMGA).

Historical note:

On the 20th of May three German divisions went over on the attack at Zelzate, Kwatrecht and Zingem. After some initial success, Belgians immediately started several counterattacks regaining most of the ground previously lost. All German attacks were repelled on the Belgian front and the Germans weren’t able to create bridgeheads over the Escaut and the Terneuzen Canal. Belgian command was confident that the Germans could be stopped at the Schelde/Escaut.

However, when the Germans shifted its attention towards the British in the south they created in the sector of the 44th Infantry division a bridgehead o over the Schelde/ Escaut, which could be used as a base for future actions.
