Omaha

Gentlemen,
although Operation Overlord is making good progress in the other sectors, here at Omaha Beach the situation is nasty. Our shore bombardement seems to have inflicted little damage to the Kraut's fortifications, our paratroopers have landed in the swamps, and our infantry is nailed to the beach, suffering from horrible casualties. We just didn't know that the strong 352nd division defends Omaha Beach!

So we will take a last effort of all COMBINED forces to turn the tables. I have ordered the destroyers and missile launchers to return to Omaha and support the 29th infantry and the Big Red One.

I will try to organize some air support as well. Last but not least I rely on our parachute and glider units who may, with the help of the French Resistance, distract the enemy from the beach and keep his reinforcements busy.
If all this doesn't help I will have to redirect our forces to Utah Beach. 'Overlord' cannot become a full success in this case ...

Generals!
Bad news from other sectors of this - as the "Fuehrer" still claims - 'pseudo invasion', good ones from the 352. ID! Despite the shock by the view of that huge armada in the morning, their moral and equipment are still intact. The Americans on the beach don't have any chance!

There are bad news from the hinterland, though! Our 3. Fallschirmjaeger division cannot immediately reinforce the main front since they have to extinguish some US airborne forces first. Unfortunately, our Panzer reserve is not yet dispatched by the Wehrmacht High Command.
And Rommel is far away in Germany ...

Anyway, we will teach the Allies a lesson like at Dieppe again!
