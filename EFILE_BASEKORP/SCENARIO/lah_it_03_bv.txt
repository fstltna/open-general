Good work.

Holland has capitulated.  We managed to link up with the 9th Panzer Division and advanced to Rotterdam.  All is not good however - upon advancing through the city soldiers of the LSSAH opened fire on Dutch soldiers outside a building.  Dutch and German officers were negotiating a surrender in that building and Fallschirmjager commander Karl Student was severely wounded.
