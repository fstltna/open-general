Marshall!

Italy is celebrating!

Your forces captured several Allied divisions trapped inland.  Peace talks are expected to bring a cease fire and we expect to sign peace within days.

You and your forces will be on trains to the Alps even as soon as the peace treaty is signed to keep Germany from invading.

God bless you, you have saved Italy from the destruction that Germany is soon to suffer.
