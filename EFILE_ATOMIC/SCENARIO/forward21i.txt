Courland Pocket
We have started several trials to elimenate the trapped Germans in Courland, but all attempts were not successful. I think your men are more suitable for this mission. Attack on the front between Liepaja and Saldus, break through the German lines and take Pavilosta.
Your troops:
You will only have your tank army for this mission.
Enemy troops:
You are facing the 16th and 18th Army. These troops are worn out, but high experienced. They have only two serious tank troops. The way to the battlefield is blocked with Blockings, Bunkers and Mindfields.
