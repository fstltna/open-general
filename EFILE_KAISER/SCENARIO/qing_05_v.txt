The Japanese divisions that had invaded Korea were utterly destroyed on the shores of the Yalu river, but the Chinese troops couldn't take advantage of their victory. Just when we were planning the liberation of Korea, our spies warned us of an imminent landing of the Japanese Second Army at Pitsewo, in Manchuria, inside the Empire and behind our own lines. So we had to go on forced marches towards the Chinese port of Liushun before the Japanese could take it. If our enemies succeeded, they could even threaten Peking.
