Ja Wolfgang, I was as surprised as you that they chose Normandy.... Ah, Herr General, come in. Allow me to explain the present situation. We have a chance to drive the Allies back into the sea, here, near Caen. I will not pretend that this will be an easy task, but you have shown yourself to be a most resourceful fellow time and time again, ja? You will need all your skill to wrest a victory here. Our thoughts are with you. Ja, As I was saying, Wolfgang....
