Comrade General, the Party has selected you for tactical operations in the invasion of Greece due to your performance in Berlin.  The Allied dogs have holed up in the area of Thermopylae.  I'm sure you know already that the Western nations believe they can hold us off until they can evacuate the country, da?  They think they can do what the Spartans did to the Persians here, in times long ago.  

Comrade General, you must show them that it is foolish to resist the tides of revolution.  Wipe out the Allied forces and take the area for mother Russia.  Intelligence reports the annoying Allied Navy may try to shell you if you go along the coast, comrade, so beware.
