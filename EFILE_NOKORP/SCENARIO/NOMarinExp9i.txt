The British are incredible. Not only didn't the loss of Gibraltar, Malta and the Suez seem to affect them, they are downright counter-attacking now!
They have regrouped in Palestina and are apparently launching a big offensive to conquer Greece. The unrest in Crete was just the tip of the iceberg, now the whole Greek mainland is burning.
Once again, your taskforce is all we have at hand right now, so you will have to do.

First task, of highest priority: British and Greek forces are besieging the capital, Athens, which is only defended by a single infantry division. Like for Chania, we need you to relieve our troops before they are overrun. We don't have troops to spare in the Balkans, so please keep them alive!
By way of consolation, you will be able to visit the Parthenon when it's over...



Instructions: Relieve the siege of Athens by eliminating all attackers.
