SITUATION:

We were able to capture New York, the US East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico while the Japanese captured San Diego, Los Angeles and San Francisco, as well as the Panama Canal. US Forces still control the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains area and the West Coast from San Francisco up to Seattle and Vancouver.

Most of the US Forces and Navy were evacuated to the Hawaii archipelago.

The plan is to attack the island of Oahu and capture Pearl Habor, sink the US fleet and gain control about the various cities and airfields.

The Japanese will lead a small attack from the northeast while most of your army will directly attack Peral Harbor from the south.

ORDERS:

Capture all VHs in 18/22/26 turns for a BV/V/TV.

NOTES:

12 naval and 12 air transports are available.
