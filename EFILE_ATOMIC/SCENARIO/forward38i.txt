Kuban-Bridgehead
Since many months the Germans has the bridgehead at the black sea. We could push them back, but all tries to destroy the Germans and their allied failed. We have reliable information that the Germans plans to evacuate the bridgehead preventing a cut off. We want attack before they can escape. Force an attack and destroy the German forces.
Your troops:
You will only have your tank army for this mission. The Germans control all two airfields in this area. We have provided an engineer troop to your army. It should be able to build a little airfield in a few days.
Enemy troops:
You are facing the 17th German Army. Also, there are several Romanian and Slovak troops. The Romanians and the Slovaks have only a low strength. The German troops has only a few tanks and only one fighter squadron. Maybe there will be no great fightback, but you have to be fast, too.
