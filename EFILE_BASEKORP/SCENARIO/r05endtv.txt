TACTICAL VICTORY

Excellent comrade!!! This is one of first big victories of this war. You have driven some elite forces of the fascists armies out of Rostov and saved the Caucasus from an attack! However many of the almost entrapped Germans managed to retreat and built up a defensive winter line at the Mius River, still tens of kilometers west of Rostov!
