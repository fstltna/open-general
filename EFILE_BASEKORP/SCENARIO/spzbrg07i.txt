Belgian Counterattack

Part 2/3 of the "Westfeldzug" minicampaign




Herr Oberst, we're stuck here and we just can't move any further. The river banks are occupied by the enemy, with the infantry heavily entrenched and supported by guns and MGs. But that's not the worst of it. The enemy has a strong tank force just beyond the river! Every time we tried to move across the meadow, they counterattacked. And we cannot bypass the meadow, because of the infantry I mentioned. What types of panzers? Well, every type imaginable. They have Chars, Somuas, Cruisers and Matildas.

They have some thirty or so tanks and it's far too many for us. We just can't move any further.



Victory conditions: Capture all VHs
