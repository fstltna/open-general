Come in General, we are ready to begin.

Hitler has decided to invade Yugoslavia after the coup that has recently transpired.

Our efforts in Albania are too late to subdue Greeks before the Germans are sure to arrive.  However, what we loose in Greece we shall gain in Yugoslavia.  

We shall claim most of northeastern Yugoslavia by right of conquest, we shall attack 1 day before the Germans do!  Take Ljubjana QUICKLY, there should be only light resistance, so we can beat the Germans to Zagreb!  Gods-speed!

STAFF INTEL: SPEED is paramount - Reconnaisance will be critical because the Yugoslavs have roadbloacks and strong points in depth.
