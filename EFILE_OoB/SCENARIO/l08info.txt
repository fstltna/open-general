08. KOS (3 October 1943)

To the commanding officer of 22. ID (LL):

Italy has surrendered to and, even worse, joined the Allies. Italian forces were occyping the Dodecanesos archipel in the Aegian sea. The past weeks British forces have been allowed to use these bases and are threatening German control of the region. The most important island of Rhodos has already been taken from the Italians before the British could react and by controlling this island we can maintain our superiority in the skies.

However the island of Kos is the only island with British presence that has an airfield from which the RAF can operate from. It is vital that the British are denied from using it much longer.

Though most of your division will stay on Crete, you have picked some elements to form a Kampfgruppe bearing your name for the capture of the Dodecanesos. Operations start with Kos where you will hit the beaches near the village of Marmari.
