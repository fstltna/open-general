Herr General, we have discovered Ivan's supply dumps and they are lightly protected. Attack immediately using your repair crews to destroy them.
The Finns have sabotaged and mined the rail line and road to delay the Russkie transports. Destroy any convoy you find, it will reduce the quantity of material reaching the front.
The Romanians are trapped and you will need to assist them also.
The Russians will respond swiftly with a counter-attack. Be ready.
Good luck.
