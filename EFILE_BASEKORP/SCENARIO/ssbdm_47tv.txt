Admiral Spruance watched as the last of His carrier planes came in.The carrier 'Lexington had 2 wings up protecting the area as Spruance's planes aboard His carrier 'Ticondaroga re-fueled and re-armed.Things had not gone as Good as the Americans would have liked but they were in their favor and one more round would get the job done and the Air would be American and the Jap Fleet would be destroyed from the Air as well as from the sea.Midway would then be in American hands.Spurance rushing the servicing of His planes was brought a message 'planes were on the horizon closing fast'.The Wildcats defending were sent off to slow them down.The Enemy planes turned out to be the SS/BdM 'Frau-Z's instead of the expected 'Zero's.The Frau's cut through the American Wildcats then flew through a hail of AA fire.Spurance's carrier was loaded with planes all over the deck.It didn't take bombs but just One Frau-Z getting over the carrier deck and strafting it with it's 20mm auto-cannon before being shot down and the 'Ticondaroga was done for.That quick the 'Tide turned at Midway.The SS/BdM aided the Japanese Imperial Air Force and the Americans lost their last fleet,another set-back.Now Rumours on the West Coast were Rampant of Japanese Invasion.Other Rumours were being spread too,the SS had flown their 'Super-bombers into Cuba,Mexico and a massive SS Fleet was coming from England.
