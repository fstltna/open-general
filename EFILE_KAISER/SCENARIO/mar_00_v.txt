Message from General Marina Vega's HQ:

Excellent, General. You have wiped out the rebel "kabilas" (local tribes) that menaced Melilla and many civilian lives have been saved.  The Spanish flag is waving on the top of Mount Gurugú and soon we'll be able to expand our area of influence in the region.  Even His Majesty King Alfonso XIII has sent you his congratulations!
