Brusilov Offensive: Lutsk Operation
4 June, 1916

Gospodin General,
The Narotch debacle has shaken the will and morale of soldiers and officers of the Northern and Western Fronts: Stavka has been unable to form a coherent plan for their participation in the summer offensive, leaving Alexei Brusilov's South-Western Front (8th, 11th, 7th, and 9th Armies) to execute the action.  With ammunition and supply problems largely solved, the Army of 1916 has become a stronger and sharper instrument of war.  Regimental and divisional commanders of veteran divisions have earned their command.  The influx of freshly formed divisions, however, has brought large masses of untrained and unprepared recruits.
Brusilov's plan hinged on two key parameters: absolute secrecy in preparation and a simultaneous front-wide offensive at the appointed time.  Throughout the spring months, artillery positions were prepared and Austrian targets were identified.  The use of air recoinassance missions aided these efforts.  The Front's artillery barrage was the largest yet employed by the Russian army, lasting 2 entire days.  The entire length of the front was covered, giving the Austrians no clues about the intended breakthrough.  The first assault has commenced, and your units must complete the breakthrough by capturing Lutsk and Berestechno.  You will also envelop the Austrian fortified line, eliminating any resistance in the cauldron.
