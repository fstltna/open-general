Raid at Binh Gia

December, 1964

[Your speech to your men] 

Ah brave fighters of the Viet-Cong!  Today will be our first action against our brothers, but do not see them as equals for they are traitors. Yes! Traitors!  They have prostituted their souls to US imperialism!  Now, it's our time to strike and give them a true taste of  Vietnamese fighters. Comrades, under the cover of the night we will take the enemy by surprise.
