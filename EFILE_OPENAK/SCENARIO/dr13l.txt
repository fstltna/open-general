Operation Typhoon - Vyazma L

You were lucky 2nd Pz and 10th Pz divisions captured your targets. Vayzma and Gzhatsk are in our hands now. Again 100,000s of Russians are trapped in pockets behind our lines. Now it's time to move East. Moscow is the target. Let's hope we have not lost too much time. Intelligence reports Siberian troops have arrived at the front already.
