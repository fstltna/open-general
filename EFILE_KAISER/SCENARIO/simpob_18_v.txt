We finished the evacuation of Ekaterinburg with only minor incidents, retreating in order to the line Yalutorovsk - Tobolsk. From there, our troops were sent to Chelyabinsk, where they were badly needed.

Although, once again, our army was saved, the main result of the Bolshevik military operations against Ekaterinburg was the occupation of the main cities and factories of the Urals, the most important industrial region of Russia. If the Red Army kept on sending its reserves against us, we'd soon be facing a bleak future.
