Good morning Feldmarschall!
This is the big day! Now that the US forces are divided between their war with Japan and their attempt to help the Canadians, we can at last carry the battle to the American soil. Well, you will, Feldmarschall: As our best officer the honor is yours.

We've detached two bataillions of our best men to help you cover the ground and secure it, for your target is nothing less than the famous city of New York!
The loss of New York should be a major hit to American morale, we hope that after such a display of force they will sue for peace with us before the Japanese arrive and claim a part of the spoils.
You need to be careful, they have infinite resources. Even though the biggest part of their force is still in the Pacific, they have an astonishing amount of troops protecting their east coast, so don't let them swamp you. Intelligence tells us the region is well protected, though their defenses are nothing compared to the British coast ones back then, they shouldn't give you any trouble.


Instructions: Capture all VHs. This is the last battle, and it will be a huge one, on a huge map.
