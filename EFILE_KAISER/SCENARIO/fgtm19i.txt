Libau Raid May (7) 20, 1915

Gospodin General-Leitenant, the focus of this war has shifted to the Eastern Front.  On May 1st, Germano-Austrian forces have broken through at Gorlice and Tarnow, dismantling our line of denfese within days and breaching the front.  The South-Western Front is desperately trying to stop the offensive by vicious counter-attacks against the Central Powers' spearhead.

Due to our actions at Przasnyz, the German plans for a coordinated spring offensive against the North-Western Front have been denied.  Having spent the strength of their divisions on the fighting, the German northern group of armies cannot undertake a strategic offensive without reinforcements from the West.  In the meanwhile, the German navy has assisted the German I Cavalry Corps in a raid against the Lithuanian port of Libau (Liepaja).  The port commander has over-reacted and ordered a full retreat in haste.

You must mobilize whatever mobile forces you can and perform a mission of utmost importance:  large quantities of supplies for the Baltic Fleet and our ground armies have been left at Libau and must be destroyed before they fall into German hands.  A small group of your forces can be deployed, and they must destroy any ONE of the supply stocks and temporarily recapture its location.
