300 B.C. : The defence of the homeland

[The Supreme druid approaches towards you:]
Our old enemies the Teutons once again invaded pillaging our tribal territory!

We have determined the day of the summer solstice as the most favorable day of attack. Teutates, Selina and Esus are with us!

Chief! Help us to defend our homeland with your men and recapture our lost land! Let the crows of the Bodb eat their carcasses! This will be a fight from which the bards will sing songs to our grandchildren .....

*Advice of your oldest Warrior:*
We should not try to occupy the settlements in the north-east, there we should retreat for the moment and try to build up a line of defense.
In the southwest the enemy seems to be weaker. . . . . We should try to break through there, to attack the enemy in the north-east in his back. . . . .
In the southwest and in the northeast we can count on strengthening of our warriors from the more distant villages. . . .
