Sakhalin Island, Russia
The Russian attack is once again rolling and the High Command has recalled you to the Pacific Fleet. So far we have not been able to make any headway onto the Chinese mainland. Our new Japanese allies fear long range missile strikes from the island of Sakhalin and we have tasked you with clearing this island. Intelligence reports that there is a large Chinese army present. You are to land at Poronask under cover of our fleet and rapidly secure the entire island before the Chinese have a chance to use their missiles on the Japanese homeland.

VICTORY CONDITIONS

You must locate and destroy the Coastal defense, the enemy Command center, and 3 long range missile batteries..
