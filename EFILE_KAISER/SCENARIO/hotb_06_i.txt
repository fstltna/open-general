Guerrero

March 29th, 1916

Look who's here, after all those years! General, it's you! How long has it been since we last met? I had heard that you had retired and that you had moved to Idaho with your family. Thank God that it was just an absurd rumor.

Strange country, Mexico, isn't it? Since they ousted president Díaz in 1911 and the revolution started, many different factions have appeared. All of them want to rule the country, and everybody is fighting against everybody else. It's really difficult to differentiate between friends and enemies. 

Anyway, President Wilson decided to support the liberal Carranza, and that's the official American policy right now. Other revolutionaries, more radical than Carranza, are fighting against him. One of the most dangerous is the former bandit Pancho Villa, well known for his cunning and audacity.

Villa was crazy enough to attack Columbus, in New Mexico, three weeks ago. He was searching for weapons and ammunition. So, naturally, Wilson ordered a punitive expedition, and that's why we're here now. Pretty incredible, I tell you.

We must do our best to capture Villa. It will be good for us and for our Mexican allies. We know that he was wounded some days ago in a skirmish against Carranza's troops, and now the Villistas have taken refuge in the village of Guerrero, near the mountains. Our camp isn't far from there, so if we send some fast units to Guerrero, we can have a great opportunity to arrest or kill the bandit Villa. 

Victory conditions:
- Destroy all the 6 Mexican units before any of them reaches the EH at (26,19)

Special notes:
- You can upgrade some of your units for free.
- You can deploy only 4 units in this scenario, preferably cavalry and other fast units.
