July, 48 B.C. * Dyrhachium

....Now after long fights complete Hispania and Italy are under Caesars control !....
....Finally, enough ships were provided to follow Pompey to Greece....
....A large part of Caesars fleet was pushed away to Dyrachium by the superior hostile sea strength....
....Despite of his numerical superiority Pompey does not want to fight! The Pompeians have dug themselves in around Petra....
....On that account, of his long experience in warfare, Caesar decides to surround his opponent with fortifications, too....
....Because Pompey does not take on the honourable fight, Caesar decides to withdraw with his troops to the direction of Apollonia:
On one hand food and fodder for the animals was consumed, on the other the people of that area were well-disposed towards Caesar, because in the past Caesar has often served them well....
To the third Caesar urgently had to reinforce his courageous Legions, which still followed him in large part from the beginning days of the Gallic war...
