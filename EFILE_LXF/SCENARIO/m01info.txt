01. Retreat to Nowhere (13 June 1940)

The past months in France have been fruitful.  You were able to establish a Czechoslovak force in exile. A full division has been raised with you commanding the Second Infantry Regiment.

The war in the West is being won by the Germans.  After the fall of Dunkirk, the German armies are now invading France proper and there is little that the Allies can do to stop them. The Germans have broken through our lines and the last days were full of hasty fighting retreats. The Czechoslovak Division was put into the frontlines at this very moment. It was no surprise that we could not turn the tide. While the First Infantry Regiment is fighting alongside the French 23rd Infantry Division, your regiment is attached to the French 4th Light Mechanized Division, or better said:  its remnants.

You current positions are north east of Paris in the vicinity of Crepy-en-Valois. Because the French troops on your flank are retreating, you have no other choice than to retreat as well. To maintain cohesion you are to safeguard a line north of Meaux at the Marne River. Here the German spearheads have cut a road and hope to encircle us. You must prevent this, and retreat in good order across the Marne River. You will be retreating south, south and even further south...

NOTE: A fighter unit has been added to your core.
