Belagerung von Paris: Chevilly

Sep 30th, 1870

Against Bismarck's wishes, the Prussian Army decided not to shell the city of Paris immediately, in order to avoid civilian casualties and undesirable diplomatic pressure from other European powers. Instead, they would take their time to gradually conquer the strong fortifications that defended Paris. Even if that failed, Prussia was sure that, when the large civilian population of Paris started to suffer the consequences of being deprived of food and other basic supplies for a long period of time, the French would have to surrender.

But that strategy was very dangerous. The German advance had been so fast that they didn't have been able to secure their flanks. As a consequence, their supply lines had become scarce and overstretched, that is say, vulnerable and easy to disrupt. Still worse, north, west and south of the positions that the German attackers were holding there were still large areas under enemy control, where the French were quickly raising new armies. Finally, many Prussian regiments were still stuck at Metz, unable to help in Paris.

In short, one successful attack was all that the French needed to turn the siege of Paris into a trap for the Germans. The hunters could easily become the prey. Under those circumstances, it was a relief when, on 28 September 1870, the allies of Prussia finally took Strasbourg, forcing the French into Belfort and the Vosgues.

In the meantime, the defenders of Paris didn't remain idle. On September 30 one French Army Corps made a sortie from the city, against the Prussian positions of Chevilly, trying to open a gap in the German lines.
