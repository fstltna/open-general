  'The End of the French'  03/21/40
 It was too much for the 'Le Grande Armee and eveyone knew it.The fall of Paris,the Sky owned by the SS/BdM Flyers and England calling all forces out of Western Europe.The Worlds finest Armee in most Eyes had been beaten by a bunch of 'Fraus.How could it be the French soldier asked himself.It was over as the SS put a chase on the last major forces running from Paris.And a massive pitiful sight it was.The soldiers were hungry,tired and knew the end was at hand.A few last stands would be made here and there for the sake of the Civilians trying to escape to embark to places around the World,anywhere the SS wasn't.And those Civilians who would arrive in Amerika would tell the stories of horror but would not be taken seriously. "No-one could be that Evil" would be the statements.And ILse was being  crowned the Top Female tactician of All Time for leading the SS to victory over the Worlds finest Armee which was now upstaged by the SS/BdM.And more Women would look towards the 'Frauland to fight for the Fuhress.And in Berlin with Western Europe in Her hands which way would the Fuhress gaze now,towards England which was drying up because of the Convoys being slaughtered or the vast land to the East,Russia?That was where the Largest Army in the World was wasn't it!
