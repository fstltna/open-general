Battle of the Hedgerows - July 1944 V

Congratulations Herr General. The American beachhead has been annihilated. Unfortunately the British and Canadians have broken through our lines near Caen. This has forced us to retreat in order to escape from getting surrounded. Our retreat allowed US forces that remained in the Cherbourg area to outflank us in the Coutance area. Your mission is to push West to the shore in order to restore the front line and cut off the US divisions that have broken through.
