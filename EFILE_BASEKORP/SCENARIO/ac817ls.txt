Il Duce, some grave news from Russia.

Our Axis corps was severely mauled trying to complete the destruction of two Soviet armies.  Apparently the soviets were much stronger than the Germans estimated and the INF corps that was eventually dispatched to help arrived too late to prevent the disaster.

Marshall Grazianni and his staff are already on his way to regroup the corps and send a detailed status report, the Corps HQ was in the main path of the soviet 57th Army.......the Germans report finding the remains of what seemed to be a brigade sized last stand near that location.
