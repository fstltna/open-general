
MARTINIQUE - 4 NOV 1943

Georgetown, British Guiana

After the capture of Trinidad by our troops a few months ago and the loss of the U.S. airfields there, the Americans probably try to get back a foothold in the southern Caribbean. Our intelligence has received information about a forthcoming operation - obviously the Americans are planning the seizure of French Martinique and other islands. In order not to lose our position here and to ensure the official neutrality of the English and French possessions, this enemy attempt must be stopped. 
Officially, French Martinique and the British Windward Islands are neutral and we have no troops there. Only the American facilities on Trinidad provided us the reason for the occupation of this island. Now we had to learn that British St. Lucia and St. Vincent make obviously common cause with the enemy and allow the Americans to use their airfields.
To give no reason for diplomatic complications we have to leave the first step to the Americans. But once the enemy attack Martinique, you will react and occupy the three islands of Martinique, St. Lucia and St. Vincent and guard them from the grasp of the enemy!

Order landing troops (6 units) and your air force to Trinidad and keep yourself ready! 

GOAL: Take all VH's!

NOTE: In this mission exceptionally the Americans makes the first move!

Bomb no infrastructure, that you may need later!
