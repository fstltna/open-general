Battle of Burkersdorf
July 21, 1762

After the death of Tsar Elizabeth, her nephew Peter III came to the throne. Peter promptly withdrew his army from the war, abandoned Russian-occupied East Prussia, and signed a treaty of peace with Frederick. Peter’s reign was short-lived, however, as his wife Catherine the Great seized the throne. She was ready to resume the war against Prussia. Seeing the necessity of quick action, Frederick decided to defeat the Austrian Army, commanded by Feldmarshall Daun, operating in Lower Silezia.
