Comrade General, I have grave news. Despite our recent successes in driving the Allies out of Europe, the Ukrainian people have risen against us out of sheer war weariness. There is only one response to such treachery.  

You must take your troops and kill the traitors, the majority of whom have taken up positions near Kharkov.  I must warn you Comrade General: Though the mutinous Ukrainian troops are nowhere near as experienced as your men, they are using the same combat equipment you have been using against the Allies for several years.  You must be prepared for anything.
