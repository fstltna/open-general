ON WATCH

Ryburn's Diary - August 28th, 2052

"The brass were pleased with my work in the highlands.  It feels good to DO some good."

"They've reassigned me to a different sector; I shouldn't specify which.   The word is that we can expect the rebels to assault our positions shortly.   I guess this is another test of my command abilities.   I don't mind though; I'm more than ready to tackle anything they throw at me."

NOTES
------------
*The rebel attack may come from anywhere.  Hold as many victory hexes as you can before the time limit expires.
*NEW EQUIPMENT AVAILABLE ON THE ROSTER.
