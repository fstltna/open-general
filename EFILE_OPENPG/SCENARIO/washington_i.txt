Europe is now united under German leadership. You have achieved the success that Napoleon only dreamed of. Now it is time for you to end the war. The Americans have long thought themselves secure because of the vastness of the oceans washing their shores. But, your initial landings in Delaware and Maryland have shaken popular confidence. They have mustered their forces to defend their capital and you must crush the defenders and seize all your objectives in and around Washington, D.C. by August 15th at the latest. Confidentially, we have reports that the US is constructing a super weapon that could totally reverse the course of this war. This weapon may be available as early as mid-July so it is imperative that you force an American surrender as early as possible.
