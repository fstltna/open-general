Enhorabuena General!

Thanks to your strong attack Santolán pumping station is back in our hands and access to safe drinking water is guaranteed. This will help to prolong our resistance in Manila while waiting for the relief expedition.

Historical background:

Manila's waterworks consisted of a pumping station located at Santolan, There, pumps pushed water through an aqueduct into Manila. The Spanish had built fortified barracks, built of stone, to guard the pumps and the reservoir intended to supply Manila for two days if the pumps failed.

On 2 July, Filipino insurgent troops attacked and seized control of Manila's only pumping station, thus cutting off the water supply to the city. Heavily outnumbered, the Spanish garrison from the waterworks was forced to retreat and fight its way back to Manila. The Spanish lines began firing in the general direction of the Filipino trenches to support Santolán troops' retreat. However, the lack of forces and the distance to the main Spanish defensive line prevented Spanish to try to recapture the waterworks.

From that moment, Manila's water supply depended on rainwater catched and stored in cisterns.
