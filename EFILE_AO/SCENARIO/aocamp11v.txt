Damn fine work out there, Commander, but it looks like the device has taken some hits.  The eggheads have no idea what's going on but the machine has been spurred into some sort of furious activity.

We don't have time to escape, Commander.  It's going to do whatever it was built to do.  Let's just hope it's not a massive bomb...

Carter out.
