   "Well they got Calvary" 
  The attack on Danzig.SS Intelligence had been corrupted here.The Spys bought by the other side.One of the 'Slights' the Fuhress would have to deal with in the future but there was not time now.So tanks of the Poles if present were not accounted for.There was reports of plenty of Calvary though and recon flights over had spotted it for the most part.A sub of the SS/KM had spotted a Brit Carrier but could not be sure it had docked in the area because having to leave the area after numerous destroyers put a chase on the sub.SS 'Erfert units were coming in by sea and other units on the Border were ready to move.So Poland was about to be cut-off and then it's Goverment would declare War on Germany which all knew was in the Cards all along.And the Fuhress,Her opinion on the Poles joining into the fight "I could care less what happens to the Poles,Slaves they were meant to be as all the rest.That is if We can find some of value.If not,Well---".
