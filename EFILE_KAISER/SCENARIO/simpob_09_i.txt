Choice. Which way, player?

Due to your great victories against the Bolsheviks, you are now in a position to change history. The Whites could win the Russian civil war and crush the Soviet revolutionaries.

If that's what you want.

Maybe you don't like to play fictional scenarios. Perhaps you've already played the victory path of this campaign and now you'd like to test new battles. There are many possible reasons.

Well, it's up to you to decide how the campaign will go on. If you click on the western flag, you'll play six fictional scenarios that will end with a total victory for the Whites.

If you click on the eastern flag, then you'll play several historical scenarios in Siberia. Depending on your performance, you'll be able to force the Soviets to accept a negotiated peace, you'll cross the Chinese border and end your days in exile, or you'll suffer a terrible death during the winter. 

Choose what you prefer.
