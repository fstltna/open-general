I still have nightmares when I remember Ekaterinburg. The Soviets struck from our rear, cutting our retreat lines. Many soldiers, civilians and equipment were trapped in the city, and despite all our efforts we couldn't evacuate them. Others died or were captured when they were trying to reach Tobolsk.

You could say that I was lucky, because I could return to our own lines. But that was the last time that I was engaged in battle. I was relieved from command due to my failure, and Kolchak sent me to maintain order in Chita, near the border with China and Mongolia. That meant that, when our army was finally defeated a few months later, it was easy to gather as many sympathizers as I could find and lead them safely to China, where the Bolsheviks couldn't harm them. After Ekaterinburg, I had a chance to redeem myself.

From China I traveled to many different countries, until in 1922 I established myself in New Zealand, where I still live. I can't complain about the life that I've lived in these last 30 years, but the truth is that I miss Russia very much. I wish that I could have done more, and that we could have won the war. I know that I should have gotten rid of all these feelings of failure and shame, but I've never been able to do that. It's true, I did my best, but now that the Soviet Union seems more powerful than ever, despair and grief take hold of my mind. I guess that it's the penance I have to pay for my sins, and I must accept it.
