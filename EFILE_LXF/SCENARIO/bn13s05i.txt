
AMIENS II - 26 MAY 1940

The counterattack has begun. At Arras British forces have attacked German Panzers and we, from the south, will over the Somme! First we will try to destroy the German bridgehead over the Somme. After that it should be a walk-over and meet our troops coming from the north.

We have assembled parts of three cavalry division, the 2nd, 3rd and 5th DLC and parts of the Scottish 51st Infantry Division and British 1st Armoured Division for the attack. German opposition will be heavy but most of their tanks are advancing to Dunkirk so should not be in the area. Vive la France!

GOAL: Take all VH's!
