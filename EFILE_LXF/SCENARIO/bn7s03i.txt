THE STORY

HMS Javelin, commanded by Capt Lord Louis Mountbatten, was part of the 5th Flotilla along with with HMS Jackal, Jupiter and Jersey. Based in Portsmouth they were tasked with seeking out German destroyers that had been raiding merchant shipping in the SW English Channel. As the four ships steamed line abreast they located three German destroyers crossing in front of them right to left. Mountbatten ordered an 80-degree manoeuvre to port in order to bring his flotilla onto a parallel course with the enemy ships. This change of course at full speed and on full helm threw the guns instruments out of synchronisation causing the director crews to lose their targets. The result was that Javelin was hit simultaneously fore and aft by two torpedoes and causing the after magazine to explode. Three officers and 43 ratings were killed. Javelin miraculously did not sink and was towed back to Portsmouth where she underwent major repairs over the following year, not resuming service until Jan 1942. His contemporaries considered Mountbatten’s handling of his flotilla in this action highly controversial. He was thought by many to be a reckless, cavalier leader and had a reputation as a ‘Jonah’.
