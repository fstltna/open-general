Clash at Narungombe

On January 1917 General Smuts was relieved of the British command. At the end of May General Van Deventer became the new commander-in-chief of the British troops. Just like Smuts had tried before, Van Deventer´s plan was to push westward from the coast both from Kilwa and from Lindi.  He will try to encircle the German forces.  In the month of July General Beves led three British columns into the mountain area of Narungombe.  Here they met a ferocious resistance from the German Askari.
