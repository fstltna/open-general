Rzhev Salient (10 Sep 1942)
Third part of the "Blitzkrieg!" minicampaign.

STRATEGIC SITUATION:
A series of battles in area of Rzhev were fought since the start of the year. While the initiative is mostly on the Soviet side, their every gain is followed by a fierce German counterattack.

TACTICAL ORDERS:
After receiving new Panzer IIIs, you moved to the vicinity of Rzhev in preparation for a small-scale attack. Unfortunately, things don't go well. Our artillery blasted off the important railway bridge by inadvertently discharging Soviet mines, so you need to cross the river elsewhere. In the west, Grossdeutschland's engineers put into the operation a ferry. In the east, there is an attempt to cross the river by neighboring infantry battalion. Join those units, break through the enemy resistance, and penetrate deep into the Soviet territory.

RECONNAISSANCE:
Soviets hold the river crossings with infantry, field and anti-aircraft artillery. Their air support is subpar to that of Germans. Air recon confirmed a light tanks battalion ready to contest your panzers. Soviet rear seems to be held by depleted forces.

NOTE:
Try to lure the enemy armoured units into the forest where they are vulnerable to your supporting infantry.

VICTORY CONDITIONS:
Capture all Victory Hexes to claim the victory!
