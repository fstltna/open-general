Riding across the Niemen River

September 20th, 1920

After nearly a month of withdrawal, the Red Army is trying to build a solid defensive line by the river Niemen, near the town of Grodno. We must break that line quickly so that we can continue our offensive before the Russian defenses are completed. Besides, the League of Nations is increasing the pressure to force a cease fire so we have only a few weeks to continue our offensive before they impose an armistice on us.

Regarding this, the High Command has made a very delicate decision. While the bulk of our army attacks Grodno and Wolkowysk, some of your best troops will advance through Sejny and Druskieniki in order to take Lida as soon as possible and thus cutting the Russian lines of retreat. You will have to cross lands that have been occupied by Lithuania, which at least in theory is a neutral country. We know that will cause a diplomatic scandal, but we are determined to take the risk since that action will allow us to advance more rapidly. Apart from that Lithuania is, in fact, a reluctant Russian ally and it claims territories that we consider to be part of Poland. 

Victory conditions: Take all VHs.

Good luck!

Note: You can buy Central Lithuanian units in this scenario.
