01/05/1940   The Road To Raate

There you are. Come in. You seem very anxious to know what I have to tell you.
Situation report: The 44th Rifle division lies on the road to Raate, without fuel and ammunition. The poor devils don't even have winter clothes...Attack and destroy the 44th Rifle division. That will complete our triumph here.
Enemy: The whole 44th Rifle division, nearly defenseless.
Our forces: Parts of your group and some battle groups raised by myself.

By the way. Watch your home base. There might be an attack from the woods.

So long. Dismissed!
