STRATEGIC SITUATION:
American forces in the Pacific are swiftly moving in the direction of Japan itself. New Guinea, the Phillipines and the Marianas have been captured. Australian forces are attacking  other Japanese positions that do not lead to Japan but are important for the Allied cause nonetheless. One of these secondary offensives will be directed at Tarakan which is important because of the oil found there. The Japanese Navy has been knocked out and their airforce is not more than a few fighters and kamikaze planes. But the Japanese Army has entrenched itself deeply on Tarakan. Numerous bunkers, pillboxes and tunnels have been constructed to counter or slow down any Allied invasion. Your force and the Australian 26th Brigade will land at Tarakan at May 1st.
