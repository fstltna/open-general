Victory! Liberal troops are fleeing in disarray and the republican government, knowing that our troops march into Madrid from several directions, has capitulated. Within a few days Carlos VII will be proclaimed the legitimate King of Spain.
Peace will be as difficult as the war, if not more. Ending the anarchy that has been ravaging Spain since this sad century began will not be easy, but with God's help and supported in Tradition and the Fueros, we will succeed.
Much of this victory is owed to you, General. You will go down in history as the greatest legitimist officer, even above Zumalacárregui. The King will soon thank you with a nobility title, and I know that he is thinking of you for the post of Minister of War. You have a bright political future, General.
