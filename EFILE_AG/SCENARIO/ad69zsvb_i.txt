The second battle of Begriacum

Vespasian against Vitellius * PL vs. PL version * S. de Mont Tonnerre MMXIII
...after the forced suicide of Nero AD 68 and the only three-month reign of Galba, Otho and Vitellius fight for the imperial crown...
Vitellius defeated Otho finally in the year 69 at the First Battle of Begriacum, near todays Cremona, but his claim to the throne was soon challenged by legions stationed in the eastern provinces, who proclaimed their commander Vespasian emperor instead. War ensued, leading to a crushing defeat for Vitellius at the Second Battle of Bedriacum.  
The army of Vespasian under his commander Marcus Antonius Primus has five Legions, Auxilia from the Danube provinces, and Praetorian cohorts.
Vitellius' troops under commanders Fabius Fabullus (Legate of the Fifth Legion) and Cassius Longus (Camp Prefect) consist of seven legions, but mostly not at full strength, vexillations of the three Britannic Legions and auxilia from the Germanic and Britannic provinces.
...will Vitellius' troops succeed this time to be victorious, or will Vespasian triumph again ? At any rate, that will be a terrible carnage: a confined space without much room to maneuver, 12 legions including auxiliary troops facing each other, - more than 75% of the Roman forces of that time... 

Have fun! :-)
