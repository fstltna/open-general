General Kurt Student

Our landing at Boston has failed, however further landings was more successful. The Americans agreed finally to peace consultations. The war is over. Your service for our country will remain unforgotten.

Thanks for playing the GREEN DEVILS! I hope you enjoyed the campaign and maybe we will see each other again here, or in another of my campaigns.
