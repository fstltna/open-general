Good Morning Major. Sorry to interrupt your "vacation", but we have a special assignment for you and some of your men! Your fighter wing is being temporarily transferred north to the LLv.24 air base at Tiiksjarvi. There have been too many Soviet recon attempts around here lately, and the enemy is likely being informed about take-offs and landings by the Partisans hiding in the forests around the base. This leads us to believe an attack is probably imminent. Your mission is to root out the Partisans and repel any possible attacks. Good luck, Major...

Objective: Destroy the 4  marked Soviet Fighters, and the Soviet Partisans
