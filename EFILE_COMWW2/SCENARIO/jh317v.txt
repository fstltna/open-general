Excellent work, Herr Feldmarschall.  You have stopped the Bolsheviks and forced them back across the Nemnuas river. Feldmarschall Manstein will now take command and continue our drive to free all of the Fatherland from the Bolsheviks.  Your superb tactical skills are needed in Hungary where the situation is critical.  The Bolsheviks have besieged Budapest,and we believe that if it falls our Hungarian allies will sue for peace.  You must relieve Budapest.
