Herr General, this victory is worthy of great praise. The southern front is now secure, and, more importantly, the Ukraine with its rich resources is ours. It is my pleasure to inform you that the Bolshevik's have sued for peace! The independence of Bylorussia and the Ukraine under German protection will stabilize our Eastern borders. Now it only remains to force the Western Allies to the peace table. It is my further pleasure to inform you that you have been promoted to Feldmarschall.
