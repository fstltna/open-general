Good work, General! It is quite clear Bolsheviks had hoped to have Budapest by a frontal assault, but your bold actions have prevented that.

On October 29, 1944, the Red Army started its offensive against Budapest. The 2nd and 3rd Ukrainian Fronts and 7th Romanian Corps split into two operating maneuver groups, advanced. The plan was to cut Budapest off from the rest of the German and Hungarian forces. On November 7, Soviet and Romanian troops entered the eastern suburbs, 20 kilometers from the town. On December 26, a road linking Budapest to Vienna was seized by Soviet troops, thereby completing the encirclement. As a result of the Soviet link-up, nearly 90,000 German and Hungarian soldiers became trapped within the city. Refusing to authorize a withdrawal, Hitler had declared Budapest a fortress city, which had to be defended to the last man.

After the failure of the relieving counterattacks (Operation Konrad I-III) and desperate breakout attempts, the remaining defenders finally surrendered on February 13, 1945. German and Hungarian military losses were high with entire divisions wiped out. The Germans lost all or most of the 13th Panzer Division, the 60th Panzergrenadier Division, the 8th SS Cavalry Division Florian Geyer and the 22nd SS Volunteer Cavalry Division Maria Theresa. The Hungarian 1st Corps was virtually annihilated. Budapest lay in ruins, with more than 80 percent of its buildings destroyed or damaged, with historical buildings like the Hungarian Parliament Building and the Royal Castle among them. All five bridges spanning the Danube were destroyed.
