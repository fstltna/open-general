Battle of El Hani and Bu Meliana - Loss

How disapointing. The Italians proved too strong for you troops. Trablusgarp seems to be lost.

Historical outcome
The Italians were dealt a crushing defeat by the more maneuverable Ottoman forces. The 11th Bersaglieri Regiment effectively seized as a fighting force and the Italians had to send many more troops to Tripoli. It took them many more weeks and troops to quell the civil unrest and to restore the perimeter around the city. Thousands of civilians got publicly executed or displaced. Houses were burned down and cattle was confiscated.
