Ukraine

Part 2/3 of the "Ostfront" minicampaign


"Aerial survey report just came, Herr General!

There are strong concentrations of enemy forces around our objectives and they are moving towards our positions. Seems like the Soviets started another counterattack. Reconnaissance reports around a hundred armoured vehicles including the heavy tanks, most of them in the southern sector around the highway.

Enemy air activity is also very severe! Russians have sent anything possible and our pilots had very difficult times... Pardon! Oh, scouts have just returned! Hm... They don't have a good news, Herr General. The initial line of static defense is once again held by second grade units and it should crack easily. But the tank forces coming our way are totally unknown to us. I fear that the enemy finally moved the Siberians to our area!

Orders?"


Victory conditions: Capture all VHs.

Hint: The scouts don't lie. Yes, there is a line of static defense and it will crack quite easily. And yes, there are mobile forces moving towards our base and these will also crack easily... everything that comes in their way. Be careful, precise and cunning.

PS: Adler, you should really use some Soviet infantry in winter uniforms... ;-)
