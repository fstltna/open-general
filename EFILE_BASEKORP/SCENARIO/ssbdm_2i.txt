    'Send the message to Rena'  
  It had been 3 years since the Fuhress had took control.Germany had become the 'Beacon of the World' for the Female gender.Women were still pouring in to join the SS.With these Women came the money and Germany had 'more than enough'.No country in History had seen the developement of it's infrastructure and industry ascend to the limit of the Frauland in such a short time and everything was structured for 'Total War'.In Berlin ILse had one thing on Her mind and that was to enslave those not of the SS/BdM of value and the rest Exterminate.Behind the 'Frau Armies sat truckloads of 'Death-heads' Eradication squads."A Necessity" ILse termed it.In the History of the World it would be termed the 'SS Plague".If Amerika had joined the Allies cause with more than supplies or Joseph Stalin had moved during '38 the World might have averted the 'Plague' but now it was too late and Stalin had his hands full to the East with the Japanese.So War was coming and France and England were about to face those their Diplomats thought could be controlled with a Good Meal,a bottle of wine,a little music and a few Roses.The message went out to the Panzers sneaking through the Ardennes,to the Flyers of the SS Air Korps sitting on the airfields and to the SS/KM. Three words, 'War' and 'Stuka's aloft.
