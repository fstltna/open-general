01. ZEELAND (15 May 1940)

STRATEGIC SITUATION:
Luckily you and your men have made it to Zeeland. The capitulation of all Dutch forces in the Netherlands except Zeeland will be signed today. After a heroic struggle we have lost the battle within four days. But we will defend the last portion of our country: Zeeland in the south west. French Maroccan forces have joined our positions and will resist the enemy. But we have no hopes of holding it out for long. Strong German formations will be your opponent. You are allowed to pull back if the pressure gets too high. We will need your men later on at the war.

TACTICAL ORDERS:
You must take up positions and hold back the enemy as long as possible time on time again. If pressure gets too high, retreat to a next line. Zeeland offers well defend-able places, so use them. On May 17th you will be evacuated so you have orders to hold out and save your men until that date. Good luck.

NOTE: You can only LOSE this scenario. Key is to keep your forces intact. On turn 10 you will receive 500 prestige. Use it well. When pressure or artillery bombardments make your positions not unable to hold, retreat! Their are three natural defensive lines that can be defended well. Use them and retreat in time.
