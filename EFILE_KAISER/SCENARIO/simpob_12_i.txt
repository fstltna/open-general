No mercy: Vyatka

October 20th, 1919

I don't like to remember the weeks that we spent repairing our railroads and fighting against the partisans. There was nothing noble in that. Only ruthless, bloody skirmishes. That summer war showed us its ugliest face.

I envied Denikin and his men. At least they were battling against real armies. They had crushed the Makhnovists in Ukraine and the Bolsheviks in Oboyan, and had kept advancing towards Orel. Meanwhile, we had been chasing murderous ghosts.

However, in the end we succeeded. By mid October all our supply lines were safe, from Vladivostok to the Volga, and we finally started to plan our new offensives. Then, just a few days later, the first snows came, at the worst possible moment. That forced Kolchak to study our different options carefully.

This time Kappel suggested to attack Saratov and join with Denikin once and for all. Kolchak considered it, before finally postponing that operation. Other generals convinced him that taking Vyatka was prioritary. During the summer the Siberian Army had assaulted the city three times, and the Bolsheviks had always rejected them. The liberation of Vyatka had thus become a matter of honour, and it was decided that it would be our next objective. Since the Siberians were exhausted after their failed offensives, Kolchak ordered us to launch the final attack.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.
