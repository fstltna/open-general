Happy new year. I hope the forced rest time has done some good to your troops, for the fuel is here at last and duty calls: We need you to dive into the desert once again, and destroy that annoying British supply base down south.
Funny thing, our Italian liaison officer told me its name translates as "The Devil's Oasis", which doesn't sound too welcoming, does it.

Anyway, since we don't want to be caught between the devil and the deep blue Mediterranean, you'll have to capture it and leave an Italian garrison there.



Instructions: Capture all VHs.
