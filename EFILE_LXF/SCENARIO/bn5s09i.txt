
SINK THE TIRPITZ - 5 OCT 1941

HQ Soviet Partisans, Estonia
CO General Karotamm

The largest German battleship, the Tirpitz, flagship of a fleet, which has supported the German landings on the Baltic islands, anchored off the coast and poses a serious threat for our Baltic fleet.
Maritime forces are not available that could match with this ship. The Harbor defense prevent submarine attacks and air attacks are useless against the strong armour. Therefore, the Germans believe their battleship is safe.
But an daring Guerrilla - Commando attack could succeed. The high command subordinate 3 Naval-Commandos to your forces. Find a way to sink the Tirpitz!

Order: Sink the Battleship! Use the air-, sea- and land-transport capability of the Commandos. Use your Partisan and Saboteur units to slow down the German advance by blow up ports, roads and bridges or lay mines.
