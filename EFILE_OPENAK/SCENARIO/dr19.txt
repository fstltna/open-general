Kharkov - March 1943

On December 30th a Fuehrer order directed Totenkopf, Leibstandarte and Das Reich - the SS Panzer Corps - to return to Russia to strengthen Army Group South. Our trains were given absolute priority over all other railway traffic. As soon as they arrived on the front, our troops were used to try and stop the Bolsjevik advance. Thanks to our commander Hausser our troops could retreat out of Kharkov - against Fuehrer orders - and avoid certain destruction. This decision saved our SS Panzer Corps as a unit and allowed us to open the counterattack in N/E direction towards Kharkov.
STAVKA is apparantly under the impression their troops are still advancing and has marched 3rd Tank Army - a mighty force of 3 Inf divisions, 3 Tank brigades and a Guard Cav Corps in a gap which had openend between our division and the Leibstandarte. Your task is to trap these formations and capture Kharkov.
