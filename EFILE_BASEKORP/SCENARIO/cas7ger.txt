The Campaign...
You take command from the invasion of Czechoslovakia, to the "lightning" victories of early World War II - and beyond! 
This campaign will test your abilities as a leader in both Blitzkrieg scenarios and defensive scenarios.


Advice to players
Veteran players should play this campaign at 50-75, experienced players at 75-100, newbies at 100-150. 
This is a campaign created for a mid-sized core army, prestige settings will as a consequence reflect this.
An army of around 30 units will suffice to carry you through this campaign
