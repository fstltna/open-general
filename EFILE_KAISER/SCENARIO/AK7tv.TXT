Tomba- November, 1917 - TV

Herr Oberst, I regret to tell you that the offensive has been cancelled. Our armies are too tired and our casualties are too high. Besides, we know that some British and French divisions will arrive very soon to the Piave and will reinforce the Italians.

We’ve done our best, and it hasn’t been enough. It doesn’t matter. Complaining is useless. Now it’s clear that the outcome of the war will be decided at the Western Front, and not in Italy. The Austrians will have to fend for themselves in the Alps. Your men will be transferred to France, where we’ll launch a final offensive next spring.
