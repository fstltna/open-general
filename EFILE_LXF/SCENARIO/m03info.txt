03. Holding the Sandcastle (8 November 1941)

Tobruk is essential for both sides fighting the desert war.   At the moment Commonwealth units hold that important port with the combined Italian-German forces besieging it.  The past months the Australian 9th Division has succesfully thwarted all attacks. Now the Diggers have been relieved by the British 70th Infantry Division, the Polish Carpathian Brigade, and your Czechoslovak force.   You have been assigned to the western part of the perimeter.

The Axis forces have assembled troops, tanks, guns and aircraft for another huge assault on Tobruk and have already begin their attack.  The situation has become critical.  Your orders are clear.  The perimeter must hold.  Any opportunities for gaining better defensive positions must be used.  Tobruk, regardless of how vulnerable it might look, must remain in Allied hands!
