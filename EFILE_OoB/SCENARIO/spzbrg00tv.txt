"Father, keep this letter by yourself and don't give it to the others, please. You'll know what you can and what you can't read them.

My beloved! 

It's pretty hot here in Spain. We've undertook our first mission yesterday, and now I finally have time, will and patience to write you a letter. It'll be very chaotic writing, but veterans advised us that it's much better to write it all right now, before our minds process their own pictures of what happened.

We were given improved panzers, so finally our Spanish friends could take our old ones. But few of them had mechanical problems with [blacked out] and hence just [blacked out] could join us. The enemy held the bridge across the [blacked out] river that crosses the path up to [blacked out]. With the help of [blacked out] that bombed their positions, we've forced the crossing, but there was so much smoke, noise, shooting and rumpus that I was really scared. But our commander lead us across the river and further to the village, where we've met the enemy again. They had several tanks, too. I don't remember much, it was like if I looked through the mist.

Ich freue mich auf Ihren Besuch!

PS: Father, just before the Reds fled, they set ablaze the nearby monastery. In previous weeks they've beaten and raped many sisters. War's so ugly. I've thought of it as a adventure, but now I see that you were right.

PPS: I did as you wished and asked Hpt. Bistroff where is he from and where he served during the Weltkrieg. Seems like he's really your man, but he can't remember you. But well, it's too long since then."
