The Romanian front: Predeal Pass

Oct 8th, 1916

The Romanians are crazy, aren't they? Just as we feared, they attacked the Empire, thinking that the Brussilow- Offensive would succeed. They crossed the Karpaten and invaded Transsilvanien, defeating the local Hungarian garrisons. 

Those days were very dangerous for the future of the Empire but, thank God, we reacted quickly. We liberated Transsilvanien with an army of imperial and German divisions, forcing the Romanians to retreat to the mountain passes.

Some days ago the Germans took the Rothenturm Pass, opening the way to Bukarest. But, in order to cross the mountains quickly, we must conquer other strategic points. Two of them are the Predeal and the Altschanz Passes, south of Kronstadt. Right now, the Romanian 2nd Army is defending them. You must take your troops and crush those Romanians that are blocking our way.

Once you defeat our enemies, we'll cross the Karpaten easily, Ploesti will be ours in a matter of days, and we'll be able to execute a pincer maneuver against Bukarest. Meanwhile, our Bulgarian friends will attack the Romanian divisions in Dobrudscha and the lower Donau. With a bit of luck, most of the country will be ours before the beginning of the winter.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.
