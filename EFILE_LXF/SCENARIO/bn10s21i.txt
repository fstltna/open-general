
REYKJAVIK - 6 FEB 1942

North off Reykjavik, Iceland

In May 1940, the British had occupied Iceland with a handful of marines, but after the British defeat in October, the garrison refused to surrender. At this time, the General Staff did not have enough capacity to expel the British and in July '41, the British garrison was shipped to Canada and handed over control to the U.S. to prevent a German occupation of Iceland.
After the U.S. entered the war in December, they undertook several attempts to bring reinforcements to Iceland, which could be more or less averted. But now it is time to eliminate this isolated outpost!

On the island a reinforced Marine brigade is stationed and already weakened air forces. More problems will cause the U.S. warships, which recently managed to break our blockade and now anchor at Reykjavik. You get two battleships at hand to deal with this threat. Your goal is to destroy the air and naval forces of the enemy, to land your troops and take all key positions, the harbor, the airfields and the U.S. headquarter at Reykjavik!

Our advantage is our Luftwaffe and that no one suspect a landing attempt at this season. The risks are great, but for the next few days unusually good weather is predicted.

Order landing troops (7 units) and your air force ready for action! 

GOAL: Take all VH's!
