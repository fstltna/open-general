
CANTON - 11 OCT 1938

Sanzao Island, South China
CO Admiral Koichi Shiozawa

Your forces will assist a combined Army/Navy landing operation to take control of the important port of Canton. A few months ago Sanzao Island near Portuguese Macao was occupied to control the Pearl River Delta and serves you now as base of operations. The fast neutralization of the strong Humen fortress at the Pearl River estuary is the key for success. But note the neutrality of British Hong Kong, Portuguese Macao and the international concession on Shamian Island in Canton.

BUY: 2 x Inf - 37 SNLF Infantry
UPG: 1 x Ftr - A2N1 -> A5M Kansen

GOAL: Take all VHs!

One additional fighter- and one reconnaissance group were deployed to your carrier Kaga. Congratulations!


BACKGROUND

The Canton Operation was part of a campaign by Japan during the Second Sino-Japanese War to blockade China to prevent it from communicating with the outside world and importing needed arms and materials. Control of Canton and the Pearl River Delta would provide a base to make the blockade of Guangdong province more effective by seizing southern China's major port and isolate the British port of Hong Kong.
