Supporting the allies: Galicia  - loss

The Russians are everywhere! Our army is routed, and the Germans will have to send their reserves to prevent the collapse of the front. After making fools of ourselves like this, I guess that they'll send us back to Turkey, where at least we can help to fight the British.

Historical outcome
The Russian attacks were finally repulsed, but the Ottomans paid a very high price for their victory.  In Galicia, during 1916 and 1917, the Turkish XV Army Corps suffered nearly 25,000 casualties, and the Russians took 10,000 Turkish prisoners of war. Finally, in 1917, between June and July, most of the XV Army Corps left Galicia and returned to Turkey.

The Ottoman effort, sending so many divisions to help Germany, Austria and Bulgaria, was extremely generous and helped to achieve the final victory of the Central Powers in the Eastern Front, but overall it was a strategical mistake. Turkey deployed some of its best soldiers far from home, so they couldn't be used to protect the Empire when the British invasions of Mesopotamia and Palestine started, or when the Arab Revolt began. The Ottomans contributed to destroy the Russian Empire, but they left their borders undefended as a consequence. In 1917 many of those soldiers retuned, but it was too late. The British were already at the gates of Gaza.
