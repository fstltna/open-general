07. GRAVE (20 September 1944)

STRATEGIC SITUATION:
Operation Market-Garden is failing. The operation up to Nijmegen went as planned but the paratroopers around Arnhem encountered experienced SS troops and the operation is failing.  101st and 82nd AB divisions have made a narrow strip of land from Eindhoven to Nijmegen and Arnhem known as the "corridor". This corridor is under constant attack on both sides by experienced German forces and some being SS and Panzer forces. Your force is part of the ground army of Operation Market-Garden and has orders to guard the bridge over the Maas river at Grave. 

TACTICAL ORDERS:
You must hold the bridge over the Maas river at Grave. It is essential that Allied forces can cross this bridge without problems. You also have orders to widen the corridor. Experienced SS and Panzer forces will be your opponent. The entire operation is failing at the moment so you at least must succeed in your mission.
