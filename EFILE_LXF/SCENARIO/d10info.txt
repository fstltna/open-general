10. BOMMELERWAARD (10 April 1945)

STRATEGIC SITUATION:
After the Battle of the Bulge the Allies are pushing into Germany to the Rhine. In March 1945 they have crossed this river and are advancing into Germany with high speed. The front in the Netherlands is still not moving. We have reason to believe that the German troops will surrender soon but you still have got orders to start a small offensive north of Sint Hertogenbosch. You must cross the Maas river and make a bridgehead on the island of Bommelerwaard. The Germans have good defensive positions but are loosing the war. If the offensive is succesful we might be able to retake the western provinces of the Netherlands before the Germans surrender.

TACTICAL ORDERS:
You must cross the Maas river north of Sint Hertogenbosch. The Germans have good defensive positions but lack ammonition and food as well as other supplies and reinforcements. You must take the island of Bommelerwaard and also establish a bridghead at Tiel. Good luck.
