Arakan

Feb, 1944

The situation has changed a lot in Burma over the last 2 years. Our decisive victory was not achieved on China, and now, the Chinese, Indians and the British have reorganized and strengthened their forces. The imperial glory will be stoped for the moment... your mission is to stop the Allied onslaught we are awaiting. Reports show that the Indian units will strike on Akyab, your mission is to stop them at all costs!. I would like to suggest you inspect the area, and use the mountain road to surprise them with the rearguard...

Good luck!.
