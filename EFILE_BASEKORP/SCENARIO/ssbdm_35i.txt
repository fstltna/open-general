   "Georgi,hold or else"  04/21/42
  The message from the Boss.Zhukov knew what 'else' meant.It meant He would get to watch His family and kins tortured before being killed then He would be tortured,be crippled and get to waste away thinking of how He had failed the 'Boss' and Mother Russia in the Cold of a Siberian Guloug.So the Soviet Armor loaded up the area around Tosno on Zhukov's orders with Stalin's blessing.Back in Berlin and the HQ at Leningrad the reports from Air Recon units dashing behind the Lines showed finally the Soviet Armor north of Belegorod was not in Mass but pockets of small Groups.SS Tank crews,the Air Korps and the Heavy Kondor Gruppens had destroyed so much that it was no longer in the area in the Fantastic numbers before and New Soviet Armor was moved to other Fronts for the SS Leningrad Front was proving too much for the Ivan tankers.So one last major Soviet Armor Group to face and with Tosno captured the Leningrad Front would be on the move South towards Moscow.In Berlin the Fuhress and War Cabinet could finally breathe a little easier.The Frau's on the Front lines of course still had many a Day ahead to gasp for Air.
