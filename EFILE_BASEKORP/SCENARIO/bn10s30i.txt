
LENINGRAD - 8 DEC 1942

South of Leningrad, Russia

We have orders to attack Leningrad immediately! However, we have too few troops - for reasons unknown to us, many units have already been transfers to Western Europe and the Finns in the north, continue refuse to participate in offensive operations against Leningrad. Thus, the brunt of the attack will be on your troops. Try to pound a breach in the Soviet defensive line and roll up the front from behind.

GOAL: Take all VH's!

NOTE: All axis nations auxiliaries are under your command.

Main reinforcements:
4-5th turn - northwest, Finnish 15th Infantry-Division
