AC073 - Conquest of Nuceria

Varinius you have tricked excellent. Now Nuceria lies ahead of you, but i don´t think he will let you flee without further ado. So be on your guard !

Historical:
Varinius started persecution immediately after he had "conquered" Spartacus´ vacated camp. On Spartacus way lay several cities, including Nuceria that he captured and reinforced his army with the freed slaves. Varinius pursued him, but could not prevent the loss of Nuceria.
