Assault on Wilno

April 18th, 1919

Good morning, Colonel. 
We have just secured the position for the assault. Easter arrives soon so try to liberate the city before the coming holidays. I think the citizens will help you and I hope there will not be  too many casualties. Our young army proved its worth and so did the Red Army. Take Wilno back. 

Victory conditions: Liberate Wilno and secure the roads heading north and east from the town - take all VHs.

Intelligence report: There are more enemy regiments in the area. There is not only the Western Division, allegedly Polish, but also a division from Pskow. Wilno is heavilly garrisoned and remnants of the previously beaten enemy can also be found outside of the town. There is the possibility that the Polish citizens of Wilno will stand against the Communists. Do not expect further reinforcements.

Good Luck!
