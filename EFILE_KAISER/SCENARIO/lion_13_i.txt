Dawa River - Jan 6th, 1918

"They struck me, but I did not become ill. They beat me, but I did not know it. When shall I awake? I will seek it yet again"
Prov. 23, 35

I'm sure that, if the British had known the outcome of the battle of Caporetto in advance, they'd never had declared war on Ethiopia. They already had enough problems with the Ottomans in Palestine, the Mad Mullah in Somalia, and the German colonial army in East Africa. Besides, they had supposed that they'd just be giving support to a larger Italian offensive. However, after Caporetto, Italy had stopped all its military actions in Africa. So, in the end, the British found themselves in the middle of a fight that they never had wished, just for the sake of an unreliable ally.

My men and I needed some time to regroup and recover after the battles of the past months, so I didn't join the fighting against the British immediately. When my troops were ready, our enemies had already opened a second front, invading Southern Ethiopia with at least six battalions of the King's African Rifles. Due to our lack of troops in that area, the Rifles had entered nearly one hundred miles into Ethiopian territory without meeting any serious opposition, and they had become a very important problem, since they were heading towards Addis Abeba. The empress met me there and told me that, before going to the front of Gondar, I should stop the second invading force.

Some days later, we met our enemies near Hudat and the Dawa River. I was determined not to let them advance any further.

Victory conditions: 
Take all the VHs.
