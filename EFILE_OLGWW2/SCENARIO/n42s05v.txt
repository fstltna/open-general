Kesselring:

Congratulations herr General,

The main part of the American 7 th army is destroyed, and already messages are coming in that they are evacuating their last bridgehead near Licata. In a few weeks the whole strategic situation in the Mediterrenean has changed beyond recognition. We will now change Sicily into an inassailabe fortress.

On the political side this victory has stabilised Mussolini's regime a bit, but we are looking for a more competent replacement in the facsist movement. However, real power in Italy is in our hands now. In a few weeks we will take charge of militairy production and rearmement in Italy, meaning Italian industry will produce German arms. Paralel to the rearmement of the Italian army a few thousand advisors will retrain the army.
