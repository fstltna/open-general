Commander Flecce Vygerr,1st SS 'Ilse,tank # 101 popped Her head out of the turret.Infantry was going by,the battle won."You there,You got a cigarette"."Sure Commander,here take the pack.You saved Our hides today.How many tanks You shoot up anyway"? Flecce hollered down into the Tiger "Beth,how many tanks We get today.5 destroyed and 2 immobilized,1 immobilized.I guess We knocked 6 out of action Frau.We are going to roll up this Front,Stalin can't stop Us now.Still going to take some time to get to Moscow but late summer or early fall We'll be at the Gates of Moscow.Of course You infantry will have to protect Us in the City street fighting from the Bolshevik infantry.I'm pretty sure Command won't be Stupid and send tanks in alone, even Tigers.I would think We would shell the Hell out of the Soviets and the Planes would drop Tons of Bombs before We go in anyway.The more Destruction I think makes the Fuhress happier.Shame they waited so long to get the Tigers here,We could've been half-way to Tosno by now and had fewer casulties.I imagine when the reports on what's happened here gets back to Stalin the Soviet Leader will be packing His suitcase just in case.Well,thanks for the cigarettes Frau,You better catch up with Your Squad and We better get back to the rear and get some Fuel and Ammo.Hopefully we'll meet in Moscow in a few months".
