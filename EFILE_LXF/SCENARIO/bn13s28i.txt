
COLMAR - 5 DEC 1944

Soon after the capture of Mulhouse Allied forces captured the rest of Alsace, except for a pocket of Germans backing onto the Rhine between Mulhouse and Strasbourg and centered on Colmar. You have been ordered to reduce the pocket with assistance of the US 36th Division.

GOAL: Take all necessary VH's! Check out which VH's need to be captured and which can't be lost!

NOTE: You should make sure you control the outer objectives before you attempt to assault the central portion of the pocket. Some of your troops have been assigned to the Strasbourg garrison, so they will not be available for this battle.

Some areas close to the Rhine are within range of artillery of the German 19th Army so should be avoided at this time.

NOTE: YOU ONLY HAVE LIMITED DEPLOYMENT IN THIS SCENARIO!
