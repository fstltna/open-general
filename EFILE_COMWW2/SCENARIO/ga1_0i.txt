Good Morning General

Latest Intelligence reports indicate the Germans are preparing to occupy the island of Spitzbergen, in order to better utilize the Meteorological and Coal mining facilities located there.  As a result, you and your men have been selected to take part in an Allied operation designed to deny Berlin any advantage they would gain by taking the island. Your mission is to disable the weather station, coal mine, and supply depot, while safely evacuating the Russian nationals off the island to Pyramiden. Good luck General...
