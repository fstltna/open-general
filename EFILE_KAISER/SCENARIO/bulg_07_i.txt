Battle of Kalimanci

July 18th, 1913

Despite your successful maneuvers, by now it's obvious that we are going to lose this war. We counted on a quick, decisive victory against Serbia while holding out the Greek Army before our other neighbours could react. But nothing of that happened. Still weakened after the war against the Ottomans, we had to go on the defensive in all fronts, and Romania and Turkey mobilized their troops sooner than we expected. With nothing to oppose them, the Turks will soon retake Odrin, and the Romanians will march to the gates of Sofia.
Now we need a quick peace treaty at all costs. With every passing day without a peace agreement, the conditions will be harder on us. We must convince our enemies that a cease fire is good for them, too.
First of all, we must stop the Serbian attack here, at Kalimanci, in the upper Bregalnica Valley. This is a mountain region, good for defensive operations. If you overcome the Serbians soon enough, we'll be able to send reinforcements to our 2nd Army, which is fighting against the Greek Army in the Struma Valley, and we'll defeat our enemies separately.

Victory conditions: After 10 turns you must hold 5 VHs for a BV, 4 VHs for a V, or 3 VHs for a TV.

Intelligence report: According to our sources, the Serbian attack will be specially hard near Grljani. While the surrounding mountains are good for defensive purposes, defending the village itself could be impossible, at least until you gather enough troops to launch a counterattack.
