This was excellent, Feldmarschall! The world is ours to command now!
You have written history, and become Germany's most glorious and beloved hero of all times. Mothers give your name to their children!...

Come on Feldmarschall, a plane is waiting to take you back home for a huge celebration which will be remembered for years. The hard work is done, we don't need you here.



(Unfortunately on your trip home your plane sufferd a rapid unscheduled disassembly over the Atlantic. It seems you had become a little too glorious and popular for some...)
