12/20/1939   Riposte

Good morning Kapteeni, 
we have prepared for the counter attack. It's time to adopt a more offensive strategy. Time is short and you have only one day to reach all objectives.
Situation report: Your combat group must spearhead into the Suojarvi area and destroy all the Soviet positions there.
Enemy: The refreshed 139th Rifle division and the newly arrived 56th Rifle division.
Our forces: Support from parts of my group and some frontier guards will arrive to secure your advance.

In contrast to us the Soviets have an airfield. Keep this in mind. Hopefully the weather will be on our side.

Good luck!
