The XIX century wasn't a lucky one for Poles. Poland was divided between the Austrian, German and Russian Empires. And, worst of all,  in 1831 Russia attacked the Kingdom of Poland and conquered the country.
 
Only in the Austro-Hungarian Empire did Polish citizens have rights. They could develop their own organizations under the rule of the house of Habsburg. Not only could these organizations be scientifical and political, but they could also be paramilitary. In 1908 a refugee from the "Russian" part of Poland, Józef Pi³sudski,  took control over these paramilitary organizations and prepared  these people to fight against the Russian Empire in the coming war.
 
The war started in 1914.

This is campaign is about him, and about his men who served in Legiony Polskie - Polish Legions in the KuK Army.

The deeds accomplished by Józef Pi³sudski and his men created Poland.

All battles depicted in this campaign, really happened, but OpG's limitations (AI, maps, engine) caused, that perfect historical accuracy was not possible.
Playing @ 100% and buying units according to briefing's suggestion, should create 'historical' core.
Decreasing prestige settings will provide harder battles. Playing @ 0% seems to be possible.
Increasing prestige settings will make refitting easier. Playing @ 300% is also fun and demanding, but gives possibility to buy extra units. 


It is a game, this campaign represent no political ideas!

The campaign was an idea of Urica, who designed campaign "The Polish-Soviet war 1919-1920". I borrowed an initial scenario from his campaign and designed few small scenarios prior to the battle of Wilno..  
Thank You Urica for idea, inspiration, maps and scenario.
