Juba Region, Southern Ethiopia
CO General Rodolfo Graziani

General, our offensive against Ethiopia runs excellent. But the Ethiopians prepare a counter-attack against our southern forces. Her forces of Bale led by Dejaz Beiene Merid were moving down from North, and more dangerous, the Sidamo Army led by Ras Desta moving in our left flank. Stop the attack and destroy the enemy, General!
