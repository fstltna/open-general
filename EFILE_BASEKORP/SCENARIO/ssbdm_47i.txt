   "Their probably just Observers" 
 The loss at Wake,then Pearl of the Pacific and West Coast Fleets.Now a chance to avenge all of that.The East Coast fleet and the new 'Wildcat Fighters on the carriers had the American Naval Brass buzzing.Finally the 'Zero would meet it's match.Midway was the Target.Lost to Japan shortly after Wake it had been a valuable asset in Japan's Pacific conquests.Take Midway and the Offensive's by the Japs will End,they are strung out all over the Pacific anyway with 'Aku's Fleet being the most Powerful stationed around Midway. Destroy His Fleet,take Midway and the Dominoes will fall one by one.Base B-17's and B-24's there and Japan would be Stupid to risk their Imperial Navy under the 'Heavies.Then an Island hopping campaign will take America all the way to Japan's Doorstep though it may take til '46.American Flyers now had the Fighter to dominate the Japs not just go toe-to-toe. Yes it was a Gamble sending the East Coast Fleet but in a few Months America would have 2O new Battleships put to sea.The attrition factor would kick in soon.So a Sub on recon.The Imperial Navy was were it was suppose to be.A few of the SS Frau's there,a surprise but what the Hell let them get a taste or Real Power,Amercan Air Power.The information back to Intelligence and then forwarded to Command.The attack would commence as planned and the Frau's were probably just Observers.This Victory would turn the 'Tide'.
