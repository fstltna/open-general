Oh, that's gotta hurt.  Their ships are on fire and their docks are in our hands, Commander.  Good work.

We took a few prisoners this time, and from the sounds of it, these scumbags fled here on two or three submarines to Mexico immediately after the end of the war, thinking they could rebuild an army and eventually retake their homeland from the joint Allied occupation.  Lunacy, if you ask me, Commander, but evidently they had enough weapons experts and scientists to make it happen.  And from the sounds of it, they might have been planning this little home away from home since the early 1930s.

Crazy.

Carter out.
