Marasesti- August, 1917 - V

An impressive performance, Oberstleutnant. You’ve opened a gap in the Romanian lines, and now our fresh troops are marching through Moldavia. Nobody can stop them! Our enemies won’t be able to recover from this huge blow. Very soon we’ll occupy the whole country, and the Romanian government will be forced to surrender. The Russians will return to their fatherland, which is quickly descending into chaos. They are demoralized, and won’t resist for much longer. Finally, after so many sacrifices, the victory in the Eastern front will be a reality.
