Ruda and Bila Cerkva

Part 2/3 of the "Battles of the Brigade" minicampaign.

*****

After the liberation of Kiev, the parts of the 1st Czechoslovak Independent Brigade moved to the area of Vasilkiv, where they underwent several missions during early days of November. Then at the very end of the year the whole brigade once again fought united. It took part in liberation of Ruda and Czechoslovaks lead the assault of Bila Cerkva.

Intelligence and reconnaisance: Ruda is occupied by elements of 2nd SS Tank Division. Scouts noticed two infantry battalions, an antitank battery, several Tiger tanks and a dozen of self-propelled howitzers and guns. We were unable to reach Bila Cerkva, therefore we can only guess the real power of city's defense. But as the garrison is subordinated to the German 4th Tank Army, it'll be to no surprise if the enemy brings some armour. Germans have also a total air supremacy.

Reinforces: None.

Hint: You may find a long-barelled AT gun very useful. Take care of terrain, try to not get stuck in a deep snow.

Victory conditions: Capture all VHs.
