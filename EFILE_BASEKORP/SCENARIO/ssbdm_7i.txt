   'Nooks You got Your hands full'  
  Two French Armee's,the 3rd and 5th at Verdun and on the move.SS Frau General 'Nooks Lyanna Mullenmark had Her forces ready for the blows to come.Unfortunately for Nooks logistics had mis-read the supply orders so She was already scrapping the bottom of the barrel on munnitions and fuel which were meant to fight 1 force not the 2 coming at her.Back in Berlin the Fuhress was getting complaint after complaint with everyone in the Field crying for this and that so they could be sure to have enough,and of course most were hoarding more than they needed,that was eveyone but Nooks."This is War" Nooks had stated "Things go wrong,mistakes are made,People are maimed and killed.Matters not the Uniform.Civilians are uprooted,pawns in the game to suffer the same.Young/Old what's the difference.It's a Necessity to a Better End Result hopefully as the Fuhress has stated.Hell I'll deal with it as it comes and if I am killed,so It was in the Cards.I'm a smart Gal,not too bad on the Eye either so a few fellas have told Me.We'll win the War whether I see it or not.If My hands get too full,well that's just too bad for Me".So Nooks just played with the Hand She was dealt.The French of course hoped it was a losing hand but so far the SS/BdM had had the Deck stacked in their favor.
