Congratulations on a victory. The bridge was destroyed thus disrupting the British supply for some days.

Historical aftermath: For some months the Germans mounted a series of raids in the Uganda railway aimed at disrupting the British supplies. These raids tried to blow bridges and plant mines in the railway. The British countered with patrols and painting the railway bed white to show removed earth. Consequently the Germans started bringing their own paint and started using delayed fuses.  This countered the British use of a flatbed car before the locomotive.
