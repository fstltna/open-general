Gaza

Nov 16th, 1918

In just one month the British have lost all the terrain that they had gained in the past year. Now that they have received the support of a tank brigade, as well as some reinforces from India and Australia, they're desperately trying to stabilize the front near Gaza. Don't stop now, General. Keep pushing the British and drive them off the Middle East.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.

Special note: 
- You can buy Ottoman equipment in this scenario.
