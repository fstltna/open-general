AC 073 - Escape from the camp of slaves

Spartacus, after defeating two of Varinius subordinate leaders, you are now almost surrounded by Varinius´ main troops.
It seems a pitched battle would take no good end. Will you succeed the outbreak and retreat over the mountains ???

Historical:
After the defeat of his lieutenants, Varinius was finally having a larger troop contingent to the site and surrounded the slave army at the camp of Heraclea. Spartacus recognized the weakness of his position, where he and his men would soon be cut off from supply. Nevertheless, he let his troops continue to strengthen the fortifications, so that Varinius happy believed that the Thracian prepared to a long siege. At night, Spartacus let bodies set up as guardians and left quietly position. He successfully led his men under the protection of the night, passing the too careless Romans. Varinius only became suspicious when he no longer heard the usual background noise from the slave camp. He conquered the empty camp and would have torn his hair when realizing how he had been led around by the nose.
