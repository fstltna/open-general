Our glorious Red Army of workers and peasants has begun the invasion of the Low Countries.  Holland fell quickly to our armored forces, but I am most displeased to inform you that the Allied pigs have managed to set up significant defenses around the Belgian port of Antwerp. Your veteran army, having served mother Russia well in the past, has been tasked with securing this vital and important city.  Crush the Allied dogs, comrade General.  The party will not be kind if you fail here.
