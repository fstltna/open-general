Colonel, welcome at our training terrain. Let me explain everything. Take some coffee and lay back. Our Turkish Army has lacked proper respect since the Great War. Our Army is badly trained and poorly equiped. Oh, yes, we have bought some equipement, but only a few light tanks and some other dated equipement... Fortunately we have non-agression pact with the Soviet-Union, our sworn enemy. A war in Europe is going on between Britain and France against our old comrades from the Great War, the Germans. Our relationship with Germany is good and because of the war, both sides have agreed with helping each other. We deliver resources to Germany and they will help us with pulling back our Army from its poor state. 

15 December, 1939

The Germans have send a poorly trained division, the 7th division, to Turkey to train it. Its commander has agreed with our General Staff for a training mission. Your 5th Infantry Division, Colonel, will also participate. You will have to defend the port of Fethiye, here in the southern region of our country. You will have to hold and if lost, recapture your targets. Any unit lost will be taken from your infantry division. Good luck, Colonel.

(NOTE 1: You have to hold all victoryhexes to win. When lost, recapture them).
(NOTE 2: You can not buy any units).
