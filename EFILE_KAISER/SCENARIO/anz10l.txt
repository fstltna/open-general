Brief to Anzac Commander.

Your failure here has enabled the Turks to hold Palistine and force us back into Egypt. What remains of your troops will spend the rest of the war in the desert protecting the Suez Canal!!!

When you get to the next HQ screen please save your game and exit. Overwrite the WW1 Efile in your PG2 folder with those contained in the Zip "WW2 Efile". Reopen your saved game and your WW1 units will have been upgraded for you.
