Herr Feldmarschall.  We have obtained an armistice with England and the United States.  Bravo!  But while we were conquering England the Bolsheviks treacherously broke our armistice with them and invaded our allied territories in Eastern Europe.  With the bulk of our forces in England and Afrika they have been able to pollute the sacred soil of the Fatherland and penetrate almost to Berlin!  You MUST stop them.
