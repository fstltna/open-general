Well done! During the lat months our enemies have lost thousands of soldiers and tons of equipment, only to occupy a handful of villages without any real strategic value. Thanks to your efforts, the Macedonian front still holds on.
The sad thing is that our army isn't strong enough to take advantage from your victories and launch an offensive. And our German allies think that Macedonia is a secondary front, so they won't send enough reinforcements here. That means that, despite your success, we'll have to adopt a defensive strategy during the next months, maybe years. However, the French have been badly beaten, so while they recover I don't think we'll see much action.
