Thanks to your rapid drive through Holland we are excellently positioned to take Belgium by coup de main as well. Even though the Belgian army is mobilised, you should be able to break through and make a thrust along the coast towards Ostend and France. Just like in the last war, we're aiming for the Channel ports!
