12/10/1939   The Sausage War

Good to have you here. Kenraalimajuri Haegglund announced your arrival.
Situation report: The Russians have pursued us to Tolvajarvi. I have already dismissed the unlucky Everstiluutnantti Rasanen. Some Russians formations are on our flank, but for some mysterious reason they do not advance.
Enemy: The 139th Rifle Division and all its elements. This unit is well trained and could now rest for some days. They have even built some fortifications. This won't make it any easier.
Our forces: You'll co-operate with Everstiluutnantti Pajari. Throw everything you have into the fight. This might be the place for our first major victory. If you can destroy the 139th Rifle Division the way to Suvilahti will be open. Perhaps we can even continue with a counter-attack.
