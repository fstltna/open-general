In November 1943 American Marines land at Torokina and establish a beachhead. Not until March 1944 the Japanese launch a massive counterattack. The attack is held and center of war moves on closer to Japan. To make American divisions free for tasks elsewhere, Australian forces will take over the American perimeter on Bougainville. But they will not sit down and be idle. The Australians will launch offensives to reduce the Japanese power on Bougainville. The Japanese have four times as much soldiers on the island. Can you liberate Bougainville all the way up to Buka in the north and Buin in the south?
