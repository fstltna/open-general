You pledged and were enlisted into the ranks of Polska Si³a Zbrojna - Army of the Kingdom of Poland.

In fact the new Polish Army had to be organized from scratch. But there was no enemy for the Poles to fight. Russia ceased to exist and neither the French, nor British were an enemy for the Poles. 
Most officers and NCOs spend the rest of the war learning and teaching.
Only the Polski Korpus Posi³kowy (Polish Auxiliary Corps - the 2nd Brigade of the Legiony under the "serious" name)  were sent to the eastern front, to Bukowina.



You will be awarded with 72pps (at least). Buy transport for infantry.
