Kiev
¯¯¯
Kiev is important both strategically as well as politically, since it is considered to be the key to the Ukraine!  The Soviets have several large armies gathered near the city. You cannot hope to beat them frontally so we will encircle them. You have been given the southern wing - cut them off as fast as you can! You are not allowed to purchase any new units.
