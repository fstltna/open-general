OPERATION AVALANCHE
September 9th, 1943

It is now time to assault the Italian mainland.  While Montgomery's 8th Army advances across the straits of Messina, your force as part of the British X Corps will land near Salerno.  On your right flank will be the U.S. 36th Infantry Division.  After securing a beach head your men should move quickly to capture Salerno and the mountain passes north of the city.  Diversionary attacks have been made to the east in order to draw away the attention of German forces.  Please note that there will be no pre-landing air and naval bombardment.
