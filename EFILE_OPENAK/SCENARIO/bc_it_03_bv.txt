BRILLIANT VICTORY

Splendid job, sir.  We've pushed the Germans back somewhat to the west of Caen, allowing Montgomery the pleasure of moving his drinks cabinet six inches closer to Berlin.  Unfortunately those German reinforcements that showed up have stalled our advance, and we need a new plan to wrest Caen from the Bosch.  I fear the words "I have a cunning plan" are rapidly marching from Montgomery's mouth with ill-deserved confidence.  Cup of tea, sir?
