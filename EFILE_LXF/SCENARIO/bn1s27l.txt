A disaster! Our Air Landing Corps is destroyed! Several rockets are hit with devastating effect in some of our accumulations of troops. The situation is critical! We must ask the Americans for armistice. You goes back to Germany, General!

Thanks for playing the GREEN DEVILS! I hope you enjoyed the campaign and maybe we will see each other again here, or in another of my campaigns.
