Note: This is a semi-historical scenario, Operation Spartan actually did involve the RAF and the RCAF. Also not sure whether it really was a live ammo exercise.

Historical note: Operation Spartan was the first large scale training  exercise involving the "Jedburghs", an elite special forces unit comprising teams of 3 men, whose mission was: to be dropped into occupied Europe to stir up the resistance, harass enemy movements and tie down as many German divisions as possible. After the liberation of Europe, the Jedburghs then served in the Pacific theatre. Canada, Britain, France and the USA all were involved in Jedburgh operations from 1943 until the end of the war...
