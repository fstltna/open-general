Frostbite in the Ardennes

February 11, 1949

Having taken what they thought would be a quick route and surprise attack on the Allied forces stationed in France, the Soviets encounter determined French and British resistance in the Ardennes.  After roughly three to four months of violent forest combat, the Red Army attempts a breakout.  The Allied forces counterattack with a ferocity never before seen in the Second Great War.
