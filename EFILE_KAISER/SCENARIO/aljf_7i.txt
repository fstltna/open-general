September, 20., 1861 Battle of the Hemp Bales
Lexington, Missouri

Dear Friend, 

the Missouri State Guard is attacking us for 8 days now. Thanks to god, we were able to build entrenchments before the fighting began. Now, our hospital at Anderson's House is  full  of many wounded soldiers and we are short of ammo and water. The only spring is under constant confederate fire and our canteens are almost empty.

They are rolling hemp bales up the hills and use them as a cover. We are loading our rifles and guns with red hot iron bullets but they soaked the hemp bales in missouri waters and our salvos won't light them up at all! We can only continue fighting for a short time, maybe only till the end of this day. We are going to die of thirst or will loose the battle and become prisoners of the Confederation!

ORDERS:

Hold the defense positions at Masonic College and Andersons's House north of Lexington and stop the confederate advance. Later you may want to take Lexington if possible.

Hold 4 VH for a brilliant victory
Hold 2 VH for a victory
Hold 1 VH for a tactical victory


ADVICE FROM YOUR OLDEST SERGEANT:
Sir, I don't think we can hold all positions at the same time. It seems to be a better tactic to defend one stronghold and recapture the other objectives later.
