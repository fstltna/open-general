      "Isn't it a Lovely Day" 
   The Fuehress was happy.Things were falling into place as She had prophasized to those in her 'Black Circle'.Joseph Stalin was moving now.Finland was under his massive armies attack,Hungary and Romania.Britian and France were threatening War and trying to sway the Poles to join in.The Royal and French Navy had asked permission to station Fleets in Dennmark and the Denns agreed.France sent Emmisaries to Berlin but the Fuehress said the Frauland was staying out of any conflict unless attacked.Add important Women across the Globe,even the USA clammoring to join the SS/BdM bringing in money and prominence filling up the SS ranks so ILse was very happy.A knock on the door,trouble brewing in the City."Yes I know" the Fuehress responded to the group, "It was bound to happen.We have many a Day of struggle ahead before We put the males in their place,under our Boots and High Heels.I knew them chasing the Skirts around wouldn't last long.And of course the War that Stalin is bringing to our doorstep we will need those males in the factories to watch over the Slaves of Europe.Stalin's a Madman as Dear Old Adolph was but His fate will be the same in the end. We need a little time to produce the Weapons to Conquer those not of the SS/BdM.I hope the Finns and Others can hold Stalin off a while but if not then We will do what must be done".
