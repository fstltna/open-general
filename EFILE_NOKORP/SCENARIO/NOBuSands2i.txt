Unfortunately the Italians are pulling their troops away, they have plans to invade Greece this autumn. Unfortunately the British plan to help Greece, which means that they are sending troops to Greece, troops which can easily be diverted towards Egypt if we get too close to their precisous Suez canal.

We'll have to try it nevertheless, go as far as you can. High Command hopes you might push as far as Alexandria before the British have the time to send reinforcements, but let's take it a step at a time: For now your prime objective is to capture the port of Mersa Matruh and the nearby airport. This will allow us to bring supplies, and hinder the British from doing so.
Given the British air superiority, we have given you a cutting edge technology long-range fighter.

Ah, one last thing: High Command is terribly pleased with your efficiency. Keep up the good work, I think a promotion is heading your way...


Instructions: Capture all VHs. As before you control the (few) Italians. You gain a free core fighter plane.
