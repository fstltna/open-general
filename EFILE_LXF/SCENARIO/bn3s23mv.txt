General Hongo Yoshio

Excellent General!  The Strait of Hormuz is under our control and the Allies asked for an armistice.  The war will be over soon and the nation deeply indebted to you.  In acknowledgment of your grand achievements a special honour is to be bestowed upon you.  You are invited to a personal audience with the Emperor in Tokyo.
