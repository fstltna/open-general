The Affair at Nery - September 1st 1914

After the battle of Le Cateau, Von Marwitz - commander of II Kavallerie Korps - sends his three cavalry divisions in pursuit of the retreating BEF. On the morning of September 1st, when the fog clears, the 4th Kavallerie Division finds itself eye to eye with the BEF's 1st Cavalry Brigade and the order to attack is given. The 1st Brigade has spent the night in and around Nery far away from other BEF or French forces and finds itself heavily outnumbered against the attacking Germans.

Further East, Von Marwitz's five Jaeger battalions and the mounted troops of IV Korps attack the BEF's 5th Division rear-guard 13th Brigade at Crepy en Valois.

Note: Four out of the five Jaeger battalions will arrive as reinforcements.
