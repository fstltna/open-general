General Gotthard Heinrici

A disaster! After your defeat over one million German soldiers laid down their weapons. Despair is everywhere, a total surrender. The war is over and we have lost, General!

Thanks for playing the GREEN DEVILS! I hope you enjoyed the campaign and maybe we will see each other again here, or in another of my campaigns.
