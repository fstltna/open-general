LOSS
------------------------------------------
After a hard and bitter fight we finally secured the Medean Pass, but we were unable to defeat the Senussi decisively. We missed the great chance to eliminate the threat to Egypt and the Suez Canal from the Turkish supported attacks from the west. It has to be said that your performance as commanding officer of this operation has been less than satisfactory. It remains to be seen how you will perform when you encounter a more formidable enemy...
