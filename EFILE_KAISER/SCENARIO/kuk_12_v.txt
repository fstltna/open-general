Finally, we have managed to break through the Russian lines. We've destroyed the Russian 3rd Army, and in the following weeks nobody will be able to stop our advance. Soon, we'll liberate Premissel, Lemberg and all of Galizien. Besides, if they want to rebuild their lines, the Russians will have to retreat from the Warschau salient, too. When the front line stabilizes, we'll be fighting inside the Russian Empire. Congratulations, General!

There is some bad news, though.  Italy will declare war on the Empire before the end of the month, so we'll have to deploy troops on three different fronts. Our army won't resist that, unless we have the support of our allies. Bulgaria might join our side in the future, but obviously Germany is our most powerful friend. The Emperor has decided to send you to our embassy in Berlin, as a military attaché, in order to improve the coordination between our two armies. It's an important mission, and don't worry, it will last just for a few months. Before you can notice, you'll be back on the front line.
