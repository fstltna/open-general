BATTLE OF OGADEN

April 14th, 1936 (Lower Ogaden Region, Hararge Province. Southern Ethiopia)

Meanwhile the war in the Ogaden had after a long hull flared up again. Prodded by both Mussolini and Badoglio, Graziani at last resumed, or prepared to resume his advance.

In the lower Ogaden, between the Webbi Shebelli river and the Tug Fafan River, were Graziani's MOST EXPERIENCED TROOPS, the Libyan Division of General Nasi. They were concentrating around Danane which Olol Dinke had in January occupied without opposition.

The Ethiopians did not wait to be surprised and attacked. For the last time in the war by attacking first they attempted to disrupt a proposed offensive.

In the lower Ogaden, Abebe Damtew with his 3000-4000 levies from the south, reinforced by Makonnen Endalkatchew and his 12,000 Illubabor men, led the attack. With them came the wife of Dejaz Hapte Mikael, governor of a small southern province; her husband was sick back at home and she was commanding his troops. They had a tank, cannons from the battle of Adowa in 1896, plenty of ammunition brought by camel, and their morale was high.

Dejaz Abebe had always had a better reputation as a war-leader and fighter than his brother Ras Desta, and his men were keen to show that they could succeed where the Sidamo army had failed.

Dejaz Abebe and Dejaz Makonnen advanced against General Nasi on 14 April.  Nasi advanced at the same time.
