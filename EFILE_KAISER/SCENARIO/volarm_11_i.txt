Orel: White avalanche

Oct 11th, 1919

You already know me. And you're familiar to me, too. We've made a long journey together. Some of you were already under my command during the Ice March, when we earned the medals with the crown of thorns and saw Lavr Kornilov die before our eyes. Others joined in the campaigns of the Kuban and the Caucasus. There are those who, for a while, believed the Bolshevik lies and belonged to the barbaric Red Army, but were clever enough to change sides.
The journey hasn't been easy. We've fought and bled together, and we've lost many good friends. But with God's help we've overcome all adversity. Every challenge has become a victory, and every victory has made us stronger. All who have tried to stop us have been crushed.
Our enemies know this, and that's the reason why five veteran enemy divisions stand on our way to Moscow here, in Orel. Fear not. It's because they're afraid of us. They know that if they sent into battle their militias we'd be in Tula before the end of the week, and in Moscow before the end of the month. The Reds are on the verge of panic, so they've decided to throw their best units into us. This battle, and the next that will come, are going to be hard, but don't forget this: They're playing their last cards. Soon they'll be exhausted, and victory will be ours.

Fear not, because victory will be ours. Fear not, because God is on our side. Fear not, because we've become invincible. My sons, my brothers, are you ready for the avalanche?

Victory conditions: 
- Take all the VHs.
