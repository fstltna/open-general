Message from General Marina Vega's HQ:

I regret to inform you that our admired General found a glorious death in the field of battle. His sacrifice allowed us to gain enough time to fortify and defend Melilla, that could finally be saved with the help of the French Army. From now on all of Morocco will be under the influence of France, and only the cities of Ceuta and Melilla will remain under the sovereignty of Spain.
