Narva Liberation
January 17, 1919

Brigaadikindral, we have returned to Narva once again.  The strategic importance of this city is immesureable.  The scale of this battle will test your skill and bravery.

In order to command complete control of the whole eastern frontier of Estonia proper, both Narva and Slantsy must be captured.  The Narva Lake divides the battlefield into two regions.  To the north, your Soomusrongide Kolon will lead the frontal breakthrough.  They will face the battered 6th Soviet rifle division.  In addition, the Finnish 1st regiment has made a successful landing at Hungerburg.  It appears that the Soviets have pulled up the 19th rifle division to Narva, because their regiments are facing the Finns.

To the south, your forces are tasked with providing a mobile brigade.  We can only guess what forces will oppose you on the road to Slantsy.  Given the information from the Finns, you should expect elements of the 19th rifle division somewhere.  Also, most alarmingly, the Soviet 1st cavalry regiment has broken away from fighting to the south-west of us and is on their way to Narva as well.

Good luck, Brigaadikindral!
