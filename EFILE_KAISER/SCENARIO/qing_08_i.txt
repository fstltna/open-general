Tientsin

Jul 13th, 1900

While we were fighting against Seymour and his relief force the Yihetuan and some units of the Qing Army had taken control of most of Tientsin. However, the Europeans, the Japanese and the Americans were defending themselves quite well  on the foreign concessions, south of the city. Athough the Chinese were attacking from three different sides the Westerners had been able to keep a supply line open, from where they received weapons, ammunition and reinforcements. So when the survivors of the Seymour column reached Tientsin, they weren't actually needed for the defence of the concessions, and most of them returned to their ships.

When our elite regiments arrived in Tientsin the Yihetuan offensive had already ended in chaos. All their attacks had failed and they were simply roaming the walled city of Tientsin. Certainly they were fierce and brave, like rabid dogs, but they were completely incapable of achieving any military objective, too. After nearly one month of victorious street battles the soldiers of the foreign coalition were confident enough to be planning a final assault on the Yihetuan positions. 

We reacted quickly. We arrested and executed all the leaders of the Yihetuan that we could find. The remaining members of the militias were forced to swear loyalty to our own units and were put under the control of some of our best army officers. Those who refused were massacred.

In just a couple of days we had cleaned the Chinese lines from undesirable elements and we were ready to face the counteroffensive of the foreign army. Their overconfidence gave us a good opportunity to defeat them before they could send even more fresh troops from the coast. If we managed to take total control of Tientsin, the coalition forces would be deprived of their most important base in mainland China, and they'd probably agree to negotiate with the Empire.
