   "Zhukov,Smokoff,who gives a Dam"
  SS Frau General Petta Pedderson's remark of 'Zhukov opposing Her.Joseph Stalin had decided to move His General Zhukov up to the Northwest Front.This of course meant the Soviets Leaders already there were Dead Men along with their Families.Georgi had done the trick in the Center stabilizing the Front.The SS Fraus were still advancing but now it was at a Snails pace.On the South Front everything was being drawed into the Stalingrad area except a small Panzer Force north of Rostav.Stalin believed if He could destroy the Forces moving from Lennigrad and retake the City the Baltics could be rolled Up,the SS in the Center cut from it's supplies and in the works also was a Pincer operation to trap the Forces of the SS converging on Stalingrad.In Berlin the Fuhress saw in the War Cabinet meetings this same Scenario but had faith not only would Frau Pedderson's troops not be stopped by the a 'little bit above Average' Soviet Defensive General but when the Soviets had got their Forces in position for the Stalingrad counter the Air Korps would pummel them until the Panzers had nothing to engage but Bolshevik corpses.With Frau-Z recon flights behind the Soviet lines Stalin would have a Hard Time surprising the Fraus.He had the Numbers though.Would that be Enough.
