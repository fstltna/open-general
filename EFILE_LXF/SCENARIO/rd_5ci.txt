Comrade General, the Allies are using the Greek island of Crete as a last bastion.  With the Greek government officially out of the picture, this island is the last obstacle to our rightful rule of the Aegean Sea.  Your forces will land at a predesignated point on the island, in the area of the city of Maleme.  Paratroopers have landed to the west of your landing zone.  

You will not be pleased to know that the Royal Navy has positioned a significant flotilla here. Our superior submarines, crafted by the loyal workers, will be dispatched to your command to remove the Allied naval threat.  Good luck, comrade General.
