So far so good. We've cleared the northern side, now we need to tackle the southern side of the St Laurent entry: You will capture Halifax, the big base of Nova Scotia.
It shouldn't be more difficult than St Johns, except that there is a land bridge to the continent and they will have no problems bringing reinforcements. Don't give them too much time.

By the time you have finished with this, your new land troops will have arrived, they left Hamburg this morning.


Instructions: Capture all VHs. Beware of Canadian reinforcements.
