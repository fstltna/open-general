July 2 1943
Good Morning General:
Since a successful invasion of France has been deemed impossible this year, HQ has decided on an invasion of the island of Sicily. The goal is to remove Sicily as a base for Axis shipping and aircraft, thus allowing free passage to Allied ships in the Mediterranean sea. Although HQ doesn't fully agree on it yet, it could also act as a precursor to an invasion of Italy. You and your men will now embark immediately for Sicily, where you will be under the overall command of General Montgomery. Your planned landing zone is in the Southern tip area of Sicily, between Pachino and it's airfield. From there you will move Northwest along National Road 124, while the British 8th Army will take Siracusa, and then move North from there. Good luck General....
