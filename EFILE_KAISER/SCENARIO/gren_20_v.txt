The Spring Offensive ended with large territorial gains for the Germans, but they did not break us. German armies were exhausted and in exposed positions, without any chance of refitting their decimated units. Their best men, the feared stormtroopers, had been annihilated. They would not be able to attack us again, they simply lacked the resources. All they could do now was wait for our final offensives and for their inevitable defeat.
