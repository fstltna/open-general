Holkham

Orders:

Good morning commander! Winston Churchill observes a maneuver near Holkham. He'll reside at Holkham Hall. If we could take him as a hostage, the war could be won soon. 
Take your men and infiltrate the british coast, locate Churchill and take him prisoner. There are several british and polish infantry units around but they are unexperienced and wont be a threat to us. Mr. Devlin, a irish anarchist, will give us some help. He knows the area and will give us useful information. Leave now commander, time is limited!
