1938 AUSTRIAN CAMPAIGN

After the re-militarisation of the Rhineland earlier and the re-armament of the German Army, Hitler has found a new goal: on 12 March 1938 Austria is under attack by its old brother-in-arms from the Great War, Germany, which is ruled by the Nazis. After a failed coup-de-palais in 1934 the Germans try to overrun the country and then annexate it before any great power, not in the last place Mussolini's Italy, is able to intervene. Austria stands alone but has an army not less than the German but smaller. Certain people in Austria are not willing to resist but the majority is convinced to stay Austrian and not become German. According to an old treaty Italy is forced to help Austria, but will Mussolini risk war with Hitler? Will Austria become another victim of the Nazis? No matter the outcome: we will resist!
