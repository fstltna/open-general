Kemmelberg- April, 1918 - L

Frau Bauernschmitt, I regret to inform you that your husband was captured last week by the enemy, during a French counterattack in Flandern. According to our information, he’s alive and well, but he has been transferred to a prisoner camp, where he’s likely to remain until the end of the war. Please accept my condolences.
