The Allies have now built up their forces and are about to unleash Operation Cobra, their attempt to break out of the Norman hedgerows once and for all. Your mission is to keep the Allies from pushing far into France until after August 18th. To do this, you should hold Rouen, Evreux, Alencon, and Laval, but at a minimum you must maintain control of at least two of these cities.
