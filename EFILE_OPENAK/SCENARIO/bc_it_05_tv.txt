TACTICAL VICTORY

Fine work, sir.  The Jerries have been thoroughly and comprehensively trounced - that's what Montogomery told Eisenhower when he lied to him this afternoon.  We have achieved some measure of success though, Caen has been taken, along with Bourgebus ridge, and now with the U.S. breakout to the west, a chance for encirclement looks enticing.  You, sir, have been afforded a few days rest.
