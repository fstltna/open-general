Herr General,

Here at Mogilev we will again carry out a pincer movement to encircle the strongly held city.

II Panzergruppe Battleplan:

1. Divide your Panzergruppe in 2 Kampfgruppe.

2. Kampfgruppe North will push east and cross the Dniepr river north of Mogilev at or around the Shklov-Orsha reach.

3. Kampfgruppe South will push east and cross the Dniepr river south of Mogilev at or around the town of Stary Bykhov.

4. The 2 Kampfgruppen will meet around the Gorki-Ryasna region to close the arms of the pincer.

Player Note: You will need to capture and hold all 8 Victory Hexes on the map for a Brilliant Victory, 6 for a regular Victory and 5 for a Tactical Victory, any less than this will result in a Loss and you will not advance in the campaign. Be ready to expel the Soviet counter-attacks.

Recomended purchase: - Sturmpionere or Brückenpionere + Upgrades and overstrengthening.

Suggested Core: - 3x Tank, 1x Anti-Tank, 6x Infantry, 2x Recon, 2x Artillery, 1x Air Defence, 1x Fighter, 1x Tac Bomber (Including Protos).

Max Core: - 17x Ground Units.

Good luck.
