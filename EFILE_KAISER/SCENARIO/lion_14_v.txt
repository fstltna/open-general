In the end, God gave us the victory. One of the greatest victories in the history of this country. The British couldn't believe what had happened, and returned to Sudan. In the north, they left Gondar, too. When August came, there weren't any British soldiers in Ethiopian soil. 

Almost at the same time, the Germans were launching their final offensives in the Balkans and in Italy. The Italians surrendered in July, leaving the British Empire as our only enemy left. We were nearly exhausted after two years of war, so we sent a message to General Allenby assuring him that, if his troops stayed in Sudan, we'd remain peacefully on our side of the border. The British never answered to our proposal, but the ceased their attacks. For a few months, it seemed that the war was over for us.
