TOBRUK - GEN. KLOPPER'S DEFENCE June 1942 L

Shame on you. Even the lack of anti-tank guns in Tobruk's garrison, the abscence of the RAF and the fact that the inexperienced South African General Klopper clearly expected an attack from the West did not lead to the fall of Tobruk. 

Move you mobile forces east. The Infantry divisions will launch another attack on the perimeter without your useless help.
