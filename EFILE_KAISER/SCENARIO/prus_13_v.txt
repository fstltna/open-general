The Army of the Loire was completely beaten. After two days of battle a third of the French soldiers had deserted, and other 29,000 men were killed, wounded or taken prisoner. The remnants of the army withdrew to the west, leaving a large part of their equipment behind. They wouldn't suppose a threat to the Prussians anymore. The reorganization of the Army of the Loire and the continuation of the war had become impossible tasks, and a relief of Paris was unthinkable. After Le Mans, there wouldn't be further major battles in the Loire region, and while the bombardment of Paris intensified, the Prussians were free to launch a final attack against the French forces in the north.
