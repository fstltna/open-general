The battle of Zhashkiv happened in a back-and-forth style. Whenever an advantage was clearly on one side, this changed immediately and with dramatic circumstances.

German forces were massive, but the Soviet were no less: general Ludvik Svoboda mentions some fifty artillery barrels per kilometer, excluding the small-caliber guns, katyushas and mortars! There was a day when 240 German bombers attacked Czechoslovak positions. Czechoslovak scouts, who spoke perfectly German, intercepted the enemy radio transmission. On one occassion they unraveled preparations for a great enemy attack, so on 22th January a joint Soviet and Czechoslovak artillery raid was conducted against the enemy. This raid was so immense, that even the official Soviet documents describe it as a "hell on earth"; more than seventy German tanks were destroyed and countless men perished. Then on the 26th January the scouts persuaded German pilots to bomb the bridge across Horny Tikich; once the bridge was ruined, Germans couldn't win the battle anymore...
