You have achieved all objectives, the mission was a complete success. Good work!

The coast is secured! The landings was successful at all major sections, only in the area around Dover we suffered heavy losses. As long as our Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine keeps the British Home Fleet away and our supply is secured, the continuation of the operation should succeed. Our next goal is to reach the line Gloucester-Oxford-London!
