Our resistance was heroic, but useless. Nothing coud stop the Red Army, and we had to retreat further into the east.

That was the last time that we acted as a coordinated army. After a bitter argument with Kolchak, Diterikhs resigned and emigrated to Harbin, in Manchuria. Kappel was appointed as the new Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Front, but there was very little that he could actually do. Without most of our equipment, and without any means of transportation, planning coordinated actions between our remaining units was nearly impossible. Besides, we suffered a constant harassment by bands of partisans, and the foreign soldiers, especially the Czechs, were becoming increasingly hostile. All of us knew that the end was near.
