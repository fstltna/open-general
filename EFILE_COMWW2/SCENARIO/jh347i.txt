Windsor
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Well, our forces have stormed ashore on England's beaches only to meet ferocious resistance.  Our drive to capture London has been stalled.  Now, your services are needed to capture Windsor, a vital communications center.  With this rail junction in our hands, London will be cut off from their industrial centers and be forced to surrender.  Good luck, Herr Feldmarschall.
