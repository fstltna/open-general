Behind the Lines

Tovarishtsh General!
Wise comrade Stalin gave orders to clear this remote section of the front totally of fascist forces.

Unfortunately very few of our glorious Red Army units are available, yet we will be victorious! 
In the German hinterland thousands of our partisans are ready to make it a living hell fo the usurpers, and cut off their supply lines!

So push forward swiftly with your Guards Tank Corps and the motorized infantry and join our fighters to liberate our occupied towns and villages!
Naturally, we need to hold our present key positions, of course!
-------------------------
Good day, Herr General!
Again the Russians are preparing for an offensive, although with relatively small forces. To preserve the chance for a counter-ofensive, we must defend every meter of ground fanatically!

Both Infantry divisions in he North may have to be sacrificed if necessary.
I will send you a Panzer division for reinforcement, with which to seal any possible break in your lines.

As soon as the enemy has spent himself, the SS-Panzergren.-Div. south of the Russians main line is to start the counter offensive and to drive the Bolshewists into the swamps.

One thing of concern to us is the increased partisan activity behind the front.
I hope that our Hungarian friends, together with the German garrisons, can keep this terror in check! Particular attention is advised along our supply lines!
The loss of the occasional Russian village is acceptable, but under no circumstances must positions 4:2, 2:16 und 20:11 be lost!
