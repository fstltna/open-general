January 17, 1945

General, 90,000 German and Hungarian soldiers are cut off and surrounded in the Hungarian capital of Budapest. The first two attempts (codenamed Operation Konrad) to relieve the besieged Budapest have failed, and the encircled troops are exhausted, they are close to surrender. Your troops must force their way into the city immediately.

HQ has approved the expansion of your forces to include an armored detachment.

NOTE: You have 30 DHs. Move 10 units onto the Escape Hex at Érd (suburb of Budapest).

RULES: Ground condition cannot be changed by weather. Your core units won't be reinforced after the battles. We are unable to replace equipment and any personnel lost.
