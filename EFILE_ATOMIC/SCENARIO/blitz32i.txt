SITUATION:

Herr General, as you know, the Boksheviks have refused our peace offers, so as part of our 
response to their treacherous attack you have been chosen to play a key role in our drive 
into southern Russia. Our Romanian Allies have rejoined us and will help you to liberate their 
lost province of Moldavia. The key cities in this province are Kishinev and Iasi (Jassy), and Iasi is your primary objective. 
Not only is this assignment strategically important, it is politically critical.  With Feldmarschall Manstein leading Army Group North through the Baltic States, while Feldmarschall Guderian's Army Group Center is liberating the Bylorussian region, your victory here will help liberate the Ukraine and force the Bolsheviks to make peace on our terms.

ORDERS: 

Take all VHs in 12/16/20 turns for a BV/V/TV.

NOTES:

3 Air Transports are available.
