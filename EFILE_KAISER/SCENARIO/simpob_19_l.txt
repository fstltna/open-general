Although our plan was good, it was poorly executed. The Soviets resisted and we couldn't encircle them. In the end we were forced to retire. The troops of the Red Army finally occupied the whole of the Urals and were given the opportunity to attack Siberia and Turkestan.

That was the last time that I was engaged in battle. I was relieved from command due to my failure, and Kolchak sent me to maintain order in Chita, near the border with China and Mongolia. That meant that, when our army was finally defeated a few months later, it was easy to gather as many sympathizers as I could find and lead them safely to China, where the Bolsheviks couldn't harm them. After Chelyabinsk, I had a chance to redeem myself.

From China I traveled to many different countries, until in 1922 I established myself in Argentina, where I still live. I can't complain about the life that I've lived in these last 30 years, but the truth is that I miss Russia very much. I wish that I could have done more, and that we could have won the war. I know that I should have gotten rid of all these feelings of failure and shame, but I've never been able to do that. It's true, I did my best, but now that the Soviet Union seems more powerful than ever, despair and grief take hold of my mind. I guess that it's the penance I have to pay for my sins, and I must accept it.
