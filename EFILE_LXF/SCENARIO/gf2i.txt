Narvik - April 13th, 1940

Our destroyers in Narvik were attacked by 5 British destroyers on April 10th after landing the Gebirgsjäger on the 9th. The British lost two destroyers. But also two German destroyers were sunk and 5 more were damaged. A British Swordfish attack on the 11 was easily repulsed.

But now naval code brakers from Naval Group West are reporting that a British battleship accompanied by multiple destroyers are sailing into the Ofotfjord - towards Narvik. 

Scharnhorst and Gneisenau are positioned too much to the North to help, but your ship is close enough to provide assistance.

Make sure at least 5 units escape from Narvik. 

Attention! Your first turn is skipped. The British go first.
