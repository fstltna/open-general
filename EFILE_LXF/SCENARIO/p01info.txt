01. BRUNETE (6 July 1937)

Your Portuguese Expeditionary Force (PEF) has been held in reserve behind the Nationalist lines near the Portuguese border in order to make sure Spanish socialist or other hostile parties get control of Spanish soil so near our own Portugal. Your PEF has been deployed behind the Nationalists' front west of Madrid.

For almost over a year, Nationalist forces stand at the western gates of Madrid in a deadly stalemate. However these troops stand in a vulnarable position because north of these western approaches the Republicans have entrenched themselves. 

The Republicans have attacked from the north to recapture these western approaches and have driven the Nationalist 71st Infantry Division back. If the Republicans reach Brunete in the south, many troops more to the east will be encircled. This is unacceptable so close to Portugal. Your PEF will counterattack immediately and restore the front. Franco has promised reinforcements. Italian and German assistance is expected as well. A Republican attack from Madrid itself is not expected but nonetheless should it happen, you should drive them back! Good luck, Colonel!
