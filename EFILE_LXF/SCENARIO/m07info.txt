07. Home? (11 May 1945)

Great news! Germany has surrendered! It is time to go home - to our beloved Mother Country!

While most of your units are still at Dunkirk,  accepting the German surrender of that port, a Token Force has been selected which will be sent through Germany and attached to the American V Corps which has recently entered Czechoslovakia. 

There have been many political problems as to what line the American armies could advance to in our country, as the Soviets are coming from east.  Without approval from the Allied Supreme HQ your Token Force will be sent forward to Prague.  

At Wenceslas Square in Prague officials of our government are awaiting for your Token Force! 

What are you waiting for!
