AC 114  *  Harbingers to the Battle of Noreia / Vorboten der Schlacht von Noreia


Storm surges and food shortage caused by climatic changings in the second half of the 2nd Century BC, drove parts of the Cimbri and Teutons to leave their homes in northern Jutland and seek a new home in southern regions. 

Now, their warriors, steeled in countless battles, encounter in the province of Noricum, the first Romans outposts.

Under control of Consul Gnaeus Carbo Papirius who is there as Proconsul in exalted position, stands the  Legio I Germanica.

Boiorix, chieftain of the Cimbri - and Teutobod, chieftain of the Teutons, know their ultimate goal must be killing Gnaeus Carbo Papirius, what will end all Roman resistance. 

Romans: Save your Consul and hold the line! (if you hold 3 Victory Hexes you gain a Glorious Victory; 2 Victory Hexes give you an Victory, 1 Victory Hex a tactical Victory)
  
Germans: Destroy all enemies especially the Consul and/or conquer all Victory Hexes!
