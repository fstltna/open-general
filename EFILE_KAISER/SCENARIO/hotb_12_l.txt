I'm really puzzled. I simply can't understand why you haven't been able to achieve your objectives in time. The Australians have been forced to clean up your mess, and the British are very disappointed with the performance of the American soldiers. They're thinking about replacing us, and I can't really blame them. Let's face it, General, you've been one of our finest commanders, but now you must take responsibility for this failure. You'll be reassigned to the staff of General Pershing, but you won't command any units on the front line again. Your warrior days are over.
