Herr Feldmarschall, this triumph is a fitting end to our Southern campaign.  Once again your skill has led to victory, and more importantly, you have prevented the Americans from using their "Atomic Bomb."  Their research facility is a gutted ruin.  It is most extraordinary that you were able to capture Knoxville despite this distraction.  We must hope that only one such facility exists.

Postscript

Despite your stunning success the free people of the world never lose their will to fight.  Cross Atlantic supply lines and stubborn resistance eventually slow your advance, stop it, then reverse it.  Several South American nations declare themselves as your allies after your initial victories on U.S. soil, but even the support they offer is not enough to turn the tide in your favour.  And across the Atlantic, in Europe, and the Soviet Union, resistance grows.  You may yet lose the war, and if you win the war, you may lose the peace that follows.

But it seems that is a story for another to write...
