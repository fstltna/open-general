
RATHDUFF AERODROME - 28 SEP 1940

Southwest off Waterford, Ireland Southcoast

As expected, the new British government is not recognized in the British dominions and in most British colonies. In Canada, a counter-government of the so-called free-Britain has established and intends to continue the war. Also the British troops in Ireland refuse to capitulate and the RAF still flying attacks against us from this island.

In reaction Case Green, the occupation of Ireland, was ordered. We intend to land simultaneously on the island at several points. You will land with your battle group on the south coast, west of Waterford. The total strength of the Irish armed forces on the island is equivalent with two divisions and is not really worth to mentioning. If these forces resist, smash it! After landing your goal is to destroy a large RAF aerodrome with the code name "Rathduff". Our intelligence says it is near the town of Clonmel. Find and destroy this base!

GOAL: Take all VH's!
