Ah, Colonel, there you are. As you know the Germans have defeated France and captured Norway, Denmark and the Low Countries, with England under attack by the Luftwaffe. The Germans were victorious due to their assault with tanks and motorized infantry. That's why the Turkish Army also wants them. Your 5th Infantry Division will be transformed into an combined tank-motorized infantry divison, the 5th Armored Division. Germany has sent the tools to do this. And to test your new division, we have made another training mission, here south of Izmir. The German 166th Infantry Division will be blocking the passes through the mountains towards Izmir. Your division must break through their lines, use your speed to rush to the passes and break through once again. The Germans have given us a batalion of reconplanes. Gain experience in this lightning warfare, because we will need that in war! Good luck, Colonel.
