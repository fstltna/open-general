Don River, Russia
CO General Erich von Manstein

The Soviets launch a large offensive at the Don River. South from your section a Russian Tank Corps broke through our lines. In the north the Hungarian 2nd Army is strongly pressed. Our troops are surrounded! Try to intercept the Russian attack from south and hold the Don bank. At time no reserves are available!
