AC 072 - Battle of Mons Garganos

Crixus, prepare yourself for your first fight without Spartacus against the Romans. In front of you is the camp of Arrius. Raze it and him to the ground !

Historical:
Rome, now finally taking the uprising serious, brought in the big guns. The Roman Senate dispatched a pair of consular legions under the command of Lucius Gellius Publicola and Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Clodianus.
Gellius subleader, propraetor Q. Arrius, lost at Mons Gargano a skirmish against the Celts of Crixus.
These, however, did not use their victory, but got pointless drunk in the conquered Roman camp.
Arrius went back and annihilate the drunken Celts almost completely.

ATTENTION:
NOT USE SPARTACUS !!!!
