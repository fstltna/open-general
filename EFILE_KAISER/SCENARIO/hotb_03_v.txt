The bravery of the Filipinos will go unrewarded. You've made them flee again after losing hundreds of soldiers. In less than six months the Filipino army has been nearly destroyed, and we control all the important towns and roads of the Philippines.

I wish that this was the end of the war, but it won't be so easy. The Filipinos will surely avoid any kind of pitched battles in the future, and they'll employ tactics of guerrilla warfare. It will be a long and frustrating war. No matter how hard we hit them, they'll hit back the next day. It's the kind of war that I loathe. As long as there is a living Filipino, we won't be able to take peace for granted.

Anyway, I've heard that Aguinaldo and his ministers might be too civilized for their own good. If we capture them, they'd probably agree to negotiate. In the future, we could grant the Philippines some kind of self-government if they accept a permanent presence of American troops and civil officials. At least, that's what I hope.  

Until that happens, I'd like you to stay here, taking care of the guerrillas, but there are different orders for you. You must go with a small contingent of troops to China, where the anti-western movement has grown increasingly violent. We must send some soldiers to protect the Americans who live there, as well as their possessions.
