Message from General Primo de Rivera's HQ:

That has certainly been an impressive counterattack! You have contributed decisively to crush the enemy attacks even before the French could deploy any reinforcements. Very well!

Besides, this battle has made France realise how serious Abd el-Krim's menace really is, so from now on the French will cooperate with us even closer. They will expand the counteroffensive at the Ouergha Valley in order to destroy the Berber strongholds at the mountains, and they will give logistical support to our most ambitious operation: A disembark at Alhucemas Bay, the very heart of the Berber lands. 

For the first time in History such an action will be taken with the combination of land troops and heavy air and naval support. If all goes well, Abd el-Krim's army will be destroyed and he will have to surrender.

You have proven once and again that you are one of our most skilled commanders, so I want you to lead the first troops that will land on the coast of Alhucemas. Good luck!
