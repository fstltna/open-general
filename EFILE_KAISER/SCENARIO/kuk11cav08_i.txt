Brzesc Litewski
(August 14, 1915)

The Russians are retreating everywhere; however, our troops are also exhausted. We reached the Bug again, and it's time to reap the rewards of this offensive: take Brest-Litovsk.

ORDER: Take all VHs and keep your MSU alive.

NOTE: The German auxes are commanded by AI. They might need your help.
