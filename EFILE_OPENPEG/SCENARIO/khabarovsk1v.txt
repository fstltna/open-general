Triumph! Your masterful victory at Khabarovsk dealt a mortal blow to the dragon. The People’s Republic of China has sued for peace, offering substantial concessions in order to avoid the embarrassment of an invasion of China, including complete independence for Taiwan. Celebrations erupted the world over as newscasts of the surrendering Chinese army spread. It seems your next tour will be the parade of a hero who liberated a continent.

Hope you enjoyed the Western Campaign v1.1.  Any feedback, good or bad, can be directed to sdkfz173@gmail.com
