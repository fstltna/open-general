Khamadan,  Nov 25, 1915
Gospodin General-Leitenant, after securing the Galician front during the Wieprz Operation, you have returned to the Kavkaz Front for an assignment of acute dimplomatic and strategic importance.  You will participate in the Persian Pacification campaign.
The Russian Empire's southern frontier, bordered by Persia and Afghanistan, is extremely porous.  This war leaves us no resources to establish a well-guarded frontier.  The Ottoman Empire has revived the specter of a Jihad against us, attempting to spread its influence upon numerous Turkik  and Islamic people under Russian Empire's rule.  The Ottomans and Germans-through their consulate missions in Persia-have actively encouraged, armed, and organized brigades of Mujahadeen with the aim of influencing the currently neutral lands to choose the sides in this war.
The Kavkaz Front has formed the Persian Expeditionary Force (Baratov), giving it mandate to exterminate the Mujahadeen brigades-many of which have organized under the leadreship of German, Austrian, and Swedish officers.  Baratov's force will split into three columns:  yours will capture Khamadan, another will enter Teheran, and the third will enter Qum.  The Russian Foreign Ministry has initiated talks with the British, who are currently advancing toward Baghdad, with the aim of coordinating campaigns in this theater of the war.
