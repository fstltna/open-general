Battle for Guam

July, 1944

I hope you have killed enought enemies in Tinian, because I think the battle for Guam will be even worse!. I haven't received many orders from Tokyo, the only I can suggest you is to take as much advantage as possible from the terrain, select carefuly where you are going to mount your lines... and kitto-katsu.
