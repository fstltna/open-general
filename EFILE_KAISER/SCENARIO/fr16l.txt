The First World War - Spring Offensive - Battle of the Lys- Mont Kemmel (Kemmelberg)- Apr 26th, 1918- L

Madame Bertaux-Levillain, I regret to inform you that your brave husband was killed by enemy artillery fire two days ago, while he was in the front line looking for weak points in the German defences. France regrets your loss, but I want to assure you that his service to our country will never be forgotten.

HISTORICAL EVENTS:

1918-MARCH-23. The Germans start their Spring Offensive, in the hope that they could defeat the Entente before the American Army could deploy its forces entirely. The offensive was, actually, a series of coordinated attacks in Northern France and Flanders.

1918-APR-7. One of those attacks (Operation Georgette) starts with the aim of taking Ypres, forcing the British forces back to the channel ports. Most of the fighting will take place near the Lys river.

1918-APR-11. The Germans manage to break through the British, Belgian and Portuguese lines, making the deepest advances by either side since 1914. However, their casualties are very high, so after a few days their attacks start to lose momentum.

1918-APR-17. The Germans launch a first assault against the Kemmelberg position, but the British repulse it. Just a few hours later, French units must relieve the decimated British divisions in that area.

1918-APR-25. The Germans attack Kemmelberg again, and this time they capture the position. Exhausted, and without the possibility of receiving any reinforces to make up for their losses, they can't exploit their success. In the meantime, the French send more divisions to the combat zone.

1918-APR-29. Unable to progres any further, the Germans cancel Operation Georgette. All the German attacks during the Spring Offensive will suffer the same fate.
