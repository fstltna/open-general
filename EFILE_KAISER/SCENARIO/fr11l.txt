The First World War - Verdun: Bois des Caures - February 24th, 1916 - LOSS

Général, Verdun has fallen. France will fight on, but it will take our nation a lot to recover from this loss. The press is blaming some generals for this debacle. Be sure that it will not be Joffre who has to take the responsibility. You are an old and well-respected soldier, my friend, therefore you will not have to fear court-martial. But it's time for you to resign and make way for younger, more capable commanders. Adieu!  


HISTORICAL EVENTS:
1916-FEB-21. "Unternehmen Gericht" (Operation Judgement), the German attack on Verdun, begins with a 10-hour artillery bombardment of nearly 1,000 guns of all calibres, followed by the advance of the three infantry coprs, spearheaded by new 'stormtrooper' and flamethrower units. While most of the French 1st line is either destroyed by artillery fire or overrun by infantry, Colonel Emile Driant and his two battalions of Chasseurs delay the German advance in the Bois des Caures for nearly 2 days, before he and most of his men are killed.

1916-FEB-25. Fort Douaumont, the largest and highest fort of the Verdun defences, is entered and occupied without a fight, by a small German raiding party.

1916-FEB-27-29. The German advance slows down due to exhaustion, high casualties, and 
the arrival of French reinforcements. Verdun is saved.
