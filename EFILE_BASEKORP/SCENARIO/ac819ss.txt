Come in General......quickly!

The cold winter proves yet again he's best Russian General!  Sit down as look at the situation map.

Our own intelligence has detected another major Soviet winter offensive directed at our own Italian 8th Army.  We must hold the line to allow Manstein's 4th Panzer Army to continue to push to link with the trapped 6th Army.

The Russians have 2 Guard's Armies to conduct their offensive!  I know you and your men are just now disembarking but you must hurry,  our IT 8th Army is critically short anti-tank guns and your appearance in the days ahead will do wonders to their morale.

STAFF INTEL:  The Russians will take at least 3-4 turns to break through the IT 8th Army.  We should first plug the holes. and then clear the west side of the Don of Russians.
