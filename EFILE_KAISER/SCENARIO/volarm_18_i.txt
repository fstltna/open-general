Perekop

Nov 7th, 1920

The Bolsheviks and their anarchist henchmen are detemined to throw us out of Crimea. It took them some months to find courage, but now it seems that the moment of truth has come.
We've prepared ourselves. In Sevastopol we have enough ships ready to embark our soldiers and our families, if necessary, and take them to a safe place. I just have to hold the Reds and the Blacks long enough, so that they won't be able to invade Crimea too fast. I've done it before, and I know that I can do it again. I haven't been able to save Russia, but at least I'll save the people who counted on us. I won't fail them this time.

Victory conditions: 
- Take all the VHs.
