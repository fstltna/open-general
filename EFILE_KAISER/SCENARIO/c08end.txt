Here, quickly, comrade!  A squadron of our loyal Cossacks have made a corridor through which we can escape!  Though not mauled, we have suffered a moral defeat from the Polish cavalry.  Worst of all, we have been denied access to the north and our entire front in Poland is rapidly collapsing...


NOTEWORTHY: Because of the numbers of forces involved, the Battle of Komarow is considered the greatest cavalry battle of the 20th century.  Also it was the last battle fought mostly by cavalry units, in which traditional cavalry tactics were used and sabers and lances played a vital role.
