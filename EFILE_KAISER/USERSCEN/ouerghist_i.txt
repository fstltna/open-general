Battle of Ouergha 

April 15, 1925

When the Spanish army retreated from Xauen, Abd el-Krim believed that, sooner or later, Spain would be forced to accept the Berber큦 peace terms. Since a Spanish counterattack seemed impossible, he felt free to attack France, the main colonial power in the region.
Thus, in april 1925, Abd el-Krim큦 army invaded the Ouergha Valley, in the French protectorate. 
After three months of ferocious fighting, and with the help of more than 100,000 reinforcement troops, the French colonial army was finally able to repel the Berber offensive. But in the meantime 48 out of 66 French frontier posts were destroyed by the rebels, some 3,000 French soldiers died, and Abd el-Krim큦 army was on the brink of taking the cities of Fez and Taza.
The battle of Ouergha made France realise how serious Abd el-Krim큦 menace really was, so the French decided to start a strong cooperation with Spain in order to defeat the Berber rebels of the Rif. The coordinated actions of both the French and the Spanish army reached its peak in september, when the dissembark at Alhucemas took place.
