General,

Despite your troops engaged several German divisions, you have managed to offer considerable resistance, to delay the German forces and to withdraw from Antwerpen/Anvers in an ordered manner.

Although Antwerpen/Anvers fell on the 18/19 May, the Belgian Army is now taking position in the Gent/Gand bridgehead, behind the Dender/Dendre and Escaut/Scheldt rivers.

Let's be confident that our improvised positions behind the Escaut/Scheldt River can stop the German offensive. 

Le Chef d'Etat-major général de l’armée (EMGA).

Historical note:

This new retreat was a serious blow on the morale of the Belgian soldiers, who couldn’t understand why they had to retreat and leave not only the fortified position of the "KW line" but also Antwerpen/Anvers and the capital Bruxelles/Brussel.

The operation was a real challenge since the Belgian Army had to retreat in some cases 100 km, transport its ammo depots (a lot being destroyed/fired as it was not possible to transport it), use secondary roads (the main ones being used by French and British) packed with compatriot refugees, and all this under the constant presence of the Luftwaffe. 

In the Antwerpen/Anvers sector all Belgian divisions (12th, 13th and 15th infantry divisions) were attacked during their retreat by the German Army, in some cases suffering serious casualties, but eventually managed to retreat over the Escaut/Scheldt River.
