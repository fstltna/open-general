September, 15., 1862 Harpers Ferry


Dear Friend, we have been ordered to Harpers Ferry. It's such a beautiful place! A little town and important railroad crossing, were the Shenandoah and Potamac Rivers meet, surrounded by mountains...

ORDERS:
Stay calm and defend this very important town! Surrender is not an option!
If possible take the Maryland Heights and try to size Jackson's HQ at Keller.

ADVICE FROM YOUR OLDEST SERGEANT:
No matter from which direction the wind is blowing -I can smell the confederats!
