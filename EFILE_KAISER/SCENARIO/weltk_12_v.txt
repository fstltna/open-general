Victory! Riga is ours, and the infiltration tactics have allowed us to achieve our goals with very few losses and without destroying most of the city. Apart from some units including the Latvian riflemen, who have fought valiantly, most of the Russian 12th Army has fled the battlefield. After so many years of war the Russian soldiers have lost their combative spirit and they refuse to fight against us. Soon Kerenski will have to accept our peace terms and, if he doesn't, he'll be ousted from power. In any case the war with Russia will soon be over.
