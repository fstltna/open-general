Commander, we never expected a loss here against a beaten and demoralized foe. Our British allies took a terrible beating as did  your own units. We had planned a quick assault into Italy in a few weeks, but now we have to bring in more forces to defeat the remnants of the Afrika Korps. This will set us back many weeks in our preparations, but it will give you time to regroup your forces for the coming assault on Italy.
