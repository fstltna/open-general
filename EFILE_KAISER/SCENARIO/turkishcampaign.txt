In the XIX Century it was undeniable that the once powerful Ottoman Empire was enduring a long period of decadence, and many European nations took advantage of it.  Algeria and Tunisia were lost to the French, Egypt to the British, and in Europe most of the Turkish Balcanic possessions had to be handed over to new countries like Greece, Romania and Bulgaria. Decade after decade, the agony of the Ottomans didn't seem to end.

Intending to stop this, the Turkish authorities tried to modernize and strengthen their armies since the decade of 1890. In the following years they had to fight wars in Greece, in Lybia,  in Macedonia and, finally, in the terrible Great War. Although they fought bravely, the Ottomans were eventually defeated, and the new Turkish Republic had to fight for its very survival until 1923, when the foreign invaders were finally expelled from the country.
