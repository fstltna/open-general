Rawa Ruska

Sep 6th, 1914

Your experiences against the Serbian army will be useful here, in Galizien. The war against the Russians hasn't started well for us in this border of the Empire. After some initial successes, those damned Russians crushed us at the Gnila Lipa River, an all our troops had to retire with heavy losses. We tried to resist in Lemberg, to no avail. That seemingly invincible fortress fell, too, less than a week ago.

I won't lie to you. The entire front could collapse if you can't buy us some time to retreat in order, so we can save as many soldiers and supplies as possible. We know that there are Russian regiments north, south and east of Rawa Ruska, so this won't be an easy mission. If you aren't careful, you could end up trapped, surrounded by enemy units. Don't hold your ground for a minute longer than necessary.

Victory conditions:
- You must evacuate 30 units through the EH at (6,37), while holding at least one VH.
