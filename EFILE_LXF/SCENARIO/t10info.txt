After our capture of Tblisi and the two important mountain passes going to Grozny and Baku, we are consolidating the area as it is very weak against counter attacks. The Russian position south of Stalingrad, thus in southern Russia, is very weak. With the Germans storming to Grozny and Baku and we having the mountain passes and Tblisi, the Russians have been making preparations to counter attack and to drive us back out of Tblisi and the passes before the Germans can join and annihilate the Russians. Your forces have positions in a large salient and encirclement is not a dream. But orders are orders: you must hold the mountains passes and Tblisi. If lost recapture them. Reinforcements are coming but we are counting on your forces. Good luck, General.
