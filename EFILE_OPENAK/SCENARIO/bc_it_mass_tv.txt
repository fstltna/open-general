TACTICAL VICTORY

Better late than never....  You've pushed the Hun over to the other side of the Mass river and given vital flank protection to our Canadian brethren.  Montgomery has granted your unit some much needed rest as a show of appreciation.  Your men will have the chance to enjoy Christmas away from the front!
