
ROANOKE RIVER - 9 OCT 1943

Rocky Mount, North Carolina, United States

The autumn offensive is imminent - it goes to the north! Our plan is to advance via Blackstone and Fort Pickett to Richmond and encircle and destroy the enemy forces in Eastern Virginia. Your task is to cross the Roanoke River and overcome the enemy defenses to create the conditions to push further on Blackstone! The Americans used the last weeks and have built a new defense line at the Roanoke River and expect our attack!

GOAL: Take all VH's!
