Very good, General. You managed to secure Crete and the action has been rated a total success. One consequence of Operation Marita - the invasion of Yugoslavia and Greece - has been that Romania, Hungary and Bulgaria are now our firm allies. They will be very useful when we embark upon our primary goal - the invasion of the Soviet Union.
