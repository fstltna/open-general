TOBRUK - THE EASTERN OFFENSIVE April 1941 - BV

Your attack was so successful that not only the 5th Pz.Rgt. and 8th Mg.Btn. were saved. You also captured Generals Lavarack and Morshead at Fort Pilastrino. 

Unfortunately the Aussies pushed us back out of the perimeter in a swift counterattack. We will attack Tobruk again once the first units of the 15th Panzer Division have arrived.

Note: Only 6 ground units can be deployed in the next scenario.
