Gelibolu (Gallipoli), April 25th 1915

Due to the deadlock in the Western front, with the trenchwarfare, and the difficut situation on the Eastern front, where the Russians are close to collapse, the Entente has planned to attack the Dardanelles. The aim is to help Russia distracting Turkish ressources, allow a passage to the Black Sea and invite the Balkan countries to abandon their neutrality and join a coalition against Turkey. 

Following an unsuccessfull naval attack to force the Dardanelles, an amphibious landing is expected in the Gallipoli peninsula.

Orders: Your mission is to avoid Entente's troops to land or to force them to reembark. Hold 5 VH for a BV, 4 for a V and 3 for a TV

Intelligence report: Main Entete's effort is expected in the south of the peninsula, but do not exclude landings in the other parts also. If needed, reinforcements will be sent to you.
