Epéhy- September, 1918 - L

Frau Bauernschmitt, I regret to inform you that your husband was captured last week by the enemy while his trench near Epéhy was overrun during a French counterattack. According to our information, he’s alive and well, but he has been transferred to a prisoner camp, where he’s likely to remain until the end of the war. Please accept my condolences.

So this is the end... my friend... Thank you for playing this campaign that the four of us made between September 2018 and December 2021. You are very welcome to post feedback on the Open General Forums (Designer's Corner section).
