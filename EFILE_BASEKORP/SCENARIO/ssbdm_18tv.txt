Sascha Horten came running into the building."Tasha,Tasha where the Hell are You"."In here You lunatic,what do You want"."Look,this is the answer to the Problem".Papers were pulled out,doodling as if a kid had been scribbling meaniless numbers, letters and stick line drawings were looked over."Sascha,You Crazy SS Bitch you've done It.This will work I am positive,now to get the Dam resources and rare materials.God I love You little Sis,You've saved Our Asses and Our Dam 'Batt will Fly"."Yes Sis and with It We will win the War against the Soviets and even Amerika Our 'Batt being so advanced"."Yes the only thing that can stop Us now will be if the Fuhress cuts the Reichmarks"."Don't worry,I've met a Pilot named Amanda and She wants to fly Our 'Batt.She came from Amerika with a group of friends and they brought a ton of Reichmarks with them,she'll get the funds to at least get the First one in the Air.Once the Fuhress sees that She will be sold and that letter from the other day of possible termination on the 29th of the Project being financed will be just a piece of trash"."Sascha let's get Our asses out of here and go celebrate,go pick up the Guys and hang one on for a few Days.Let the Fuhress and those Gestapa Guard Dogs she's had keeping an eye on Us and those precious Reichmarks have a 'Hissyfit'.We'll get everything straighten out next week.To have been right to the Brink of the Project folding has been too much.Did I tell You I love You little Sis"?
