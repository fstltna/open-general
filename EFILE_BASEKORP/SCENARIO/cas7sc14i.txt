The conquest of Greece would not be complete without capturing the largest island, Crete. If we are to control the Mediterranean Sea - we have to dislodge the Allied forces that escaped from the mainland. You will be assisted by our Fallschirmjaegers that will make the largest airborne assault operation ever undertaken. Move as quickly as possible and don't let them down, as they can't hold their positions for long without your help. By the way - intelligence reports state there might be some enemy submarine activity north of the island, so you'd better get your troops ashore quickly.
