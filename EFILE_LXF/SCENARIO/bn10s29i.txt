
KIROV - 20 NOV 1942

Eeast of Kirov by train, Russia

On your way back to the West there could be problems! In Kirov, an important railway junction, are Partisans on the loose! The 286th Security Division, responsible for this area, does not seem to be the master of the situation. Bridges and rails were blown up or mined. Prepare your troops for an uncomfortable passage, and if necessary take all measures to ensure a speedy advance of your forces!

GOAL: Reach with 12 ground units in rail transport the Exit Point!

HINTS: Make sure that you own one or better two units, that no need a rail station to be unloaded from rail transport and own the ability to clear mines, for example infantry without transport.

You can only deploy ground units in this scenario and the Exit Hex can only used by units in rail transport, so embark as much of your units as possible in rail transport at scenario start!
