1939-42 GERMAN FLEET AT WAR

This short campaign covers the actions of German capital ships from 1939 to early 1942 in 7 short scenarios. You start as captain of the pocket battleship Graf Spee in the waters off the River Plate. Your task is to defeat the enemy opposition and make it back home in order to participate in the invasion of Norway and later accompany the Bismarck on its first mission. Some of the scenarios are not easy, but because they are short, you can easily retry them after a loss.

The campaign is based on Vincent P. O´Hara´s book The German Fleet at War 1939-1945 that was donated to me by Steve Brown.
