1925 Battle of Ouergha

(Fictional scenario)

April, 15th, 1925

Telephonic conversation with General Primo de Rivera's HQ:

Good morning, General. First of all, my congratulations. As part of our cooperation agreement with the Government of France accepted your elite column to be trained along with French units near the city of Fez. I didn't expect your troops to perform so well. You have earned the respect of Maréchal Lyautey himself and that will undoubtedly increase the prestige of our army among our neighbors.

But I'm not calling you for that reason. The French authorities have reported some enemy movements near their borders in the Ouergha Valley. I don't think that Abd el-Krim is so imprudent as to attack the French Protectorate, but since your troops are already in the region and the French have scarce units at the Ouergha; I want you to help our allies in case any enemy aggression takes place.  You need to hold until they can mobilize enough reinforcements.


Victory conditions: Take all VHs.
