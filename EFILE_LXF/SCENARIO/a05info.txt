05. RETREAT TO VIENNA (11 April 1938)

The Enns Line held out for a week but the German Army is just too strong. Our reserves did everything they could but the Enns Line was lost. Many formations have either been destroyed, surrendered or fallen apart. However we have been able to retreat in order with some units, which are our most elite ones. Your forces are the longest to remain on position, but now the time has come to pull back as well.

While the remaining elements of our Army are manning the city gates of Vienna, your forces are still several kilometres in front of Vienna, and are even on the western back of Traisen River in the vicinity of Sankt Polten. The Germans are storming towards Vienna.

You have orders to retreat to Vienna. The Germans are right behind you so be sure to maintain speed while pulling back but also cover your back. Good luck, General, and remember: we cannot hold Vienna without your force!

NOTE: THE GOAL IN THIS SCENARIO IS TO REACH THE RETREAT HEX WHICH ARE LOCATED IN VIENNA IN THE EAST WITH 8 UNITS. BE QUICK TO PULL BACK, HOWEVER BE SURE TO KEEP YOUR UNITS ALIVE WHILE RETREATING!
