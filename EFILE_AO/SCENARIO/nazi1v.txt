Excellent work, Herr Feldmarschall.  Low on supplies and cut off from the rest of the Empire, the Japanese troops have had little choice but to surrender or face annihilation.  Most of them have chosen to fight to the last.

Do not fear nuclear retaliation, Herr General; the Japanese will never subject themselves to the shame that would result from the use of such a "cowardly" weapon.
