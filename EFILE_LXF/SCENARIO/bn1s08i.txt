HQ German Africa Corps, Libya
General Erwin Rommel

General Major, welcome to North Africa. Your parachute division is the immediately needed reinforcement for our battle-weary troops. The enemy becomes stronger with each day. We must re-establish mobile warfare at the front. You will launch a diversionary attack on the English positions in the north, while our armoured Divisions will attempt a breakthrough in the south. Good luck!
