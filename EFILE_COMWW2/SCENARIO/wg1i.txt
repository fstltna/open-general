Herr General, we have underestimated the Bolsheviks' powers of resistance. They have crossed the Don and completely encircled Sixth Army! You must drive towards Gromoslavka and enter it with sufficient force, securing a base from which we can re-establish contact with von Paulus's trapped forces. We will never, never surrender to the Red Army, but in order for us to hold our position in Stalingrad, you must prevail. Good Luck.

VICTORY CONDITIONS:  

Occupy Gromoslavka by moving 6 ground units into it.

NOTE: 

Be careful not to lose your marked unit, it must survive through the duration of the campaign.
