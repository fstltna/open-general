All right, change of plans. Intelligence has spotted where the Russian government is hiding since they fled from Moscow: It's a small city on the border of lake Balkhash in the east, unfortunately way beyond the current reach of our army.

But not beyond the reach of our aviation. High Command has conceived a cunning plan you're supposed to carry out, having the biggest amount of veteran infantry units.

You are to parachute a small force into that city, not more than 10 units. They are to capture 3 important buildings supposed to contain important documents You are also to take prisoner or eliminate the Russian government present in one of those buildings. Once this is done, you're supposed to use one of the two local airports to fly out. Or build your own if you have to.

You might need to reequip some of your units for this mission. Also take care while approaching: We don't think they have any planes stationed nearby, but given the city is within the reach of our planes, they are sure to have placed heavy AA batteries all around it.
