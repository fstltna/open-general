Okay, let's change the situation: You're attacked, once again, but now your troops are spread over the map, with only a few units directly in the path of the enemy.
Beware, you only have two Victory Hexes, close together, and if the enemy takes them it's Game Over!
Also, from now on the enemy will sport adult-sized tanks. No more cannon fodder.

After you have dealt with that offensive, it will be your turn to go bother your opponent. His territory is full of canals, so you will need to build a lot of bridges...

Once again there are two Bonus Bunkers for you to harvest if you're fast enough. By now you should have acquired enough long-range artillery to make this a mere formality.

Nevertheless, you get some freebies. Enjoy!
