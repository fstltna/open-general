Good job! The German offensive has been stopped, and it's obvious that they're running out of reserves and supplies. If things go on like this, soon they'll have nothing left to fight with. However, let's not underestimate the Krauts. Their first assault on the Marne may have failed, but I doubt they've given up so easily. I'm sure they'll try again.
