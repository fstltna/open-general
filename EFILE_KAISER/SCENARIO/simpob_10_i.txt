We'll never leave again: Kazan

June 10th, 1919

After taking Chistopol we spent a few days resting and resupplying, but we continued our offensive as soon as we could. We were anxious to reach the shores of the Volga before the Red Army could recover. It would be our best chance to recover Kazan and its neighbouring area  once and for all.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.
