
COLMAR II - 7 JAN 1945

On January 1 the Germans launch an offensive, codenamed "Nordwind", aimed at recapturing northern Alsace. It has been contemplated to withdraw Allied forces from Strasbourg, however due to pressure (in part from yourself) Strasbourg will be held. 

A few days after the start of Operation Nordwind the Germans launch another offensive, Operation Sonnenwende, from the south of Strasbourg. This offensive is launched from the north of the Colmar pocket with an infantry division and supporting armored units - you must contain the attack at all costs.

GOAL: Take all VH's!
