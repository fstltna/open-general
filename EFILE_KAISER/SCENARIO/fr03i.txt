French conquest of Morocco - Sidi Bou Othmane - 6th, Sep. 1912


Ma chère femme,

The QG appreciates my expierence in colonial warfare. As you know, after Indochine and Madagascar this is my third command in our colonies..... So here, in French Maroc, I've taken command over our second Column under the high command of Colonel Mangin.

Our actions in North Africa the last years have led to a international crisis with all the other powerful European states. Sometimes it seemed that it was really going to become an armed conflict. I must confess you that I have bad feelings about this. I really think that there will be a Great War in Europe soon, especially if those perfidious, damned Germans don't cease to provoke us. Three generations of French citizens haven't forgotten the shame of 1871.

But maybe I'm wrong, its just a feeling, after all.... and first I must solve the problems here.

After the big Maroc uprising, we have secured the city of Casablanca and the whole coast, but in Southern Maroc still resist some rebels, holding the important city of Marrakech.
Colonel Mangin and my brave men have been sent to retake the control of this city.

Now, ma chère Fabienne, our columns are standing close to Sidi Bou Othmane. The road is blocked by enemies and we have run out of water, but don't worry. I've been in worse situations before. I'll write you again, as soon as possible.
 
Tell the kids that I'll be back home soon. I'm eager to meet our youngest granddaughter. Je t'embrasse,

Jean-Babtiste.

ORDERS: Colonel Bertaux-Levillain, you are ordered to support Colonel Mangin. Break through the enemy lines to continue the march to Marrakech.

OBJECTIVES: Take all VHs

REMARKS: You stand deep in enemy land, so it's not possible to deploy reinforcements later. [No Deploy Hex].

IMPORTANT NOTE: Its very hard and dangerous to reach a BV. Watch out for possible Counterattacks !
