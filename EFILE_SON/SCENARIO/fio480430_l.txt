Well, General, nobody expected that the Papal State and the volunteers from the north Italian cities would join the Sardinian army. With such limited forces you weren’t able to prevent Italians from crossing the River Etsch. They succeeded in driving your troops from all the positions at Pastrengo and Bussolengo. The High Command orders you to retreat into our strongholds around Verona.
