STORY: In February 1941, intensive preparations to strengthen the Italian front line began. By the end of the month, the 15 Italian divisions fighting in Albania had been reinforced by an additional 10. In order to raise the morale of the soldiers, Benito Mussolini ordered the units to be accompanied by the most aggressive fascist cadres, and also by government ministers and high-ranking officials.

The operation was to be directed and observed by Mussolini himself, who arrived in Tirana on 2 March 1941, while Italian radio announced that the dictator himself would personally lead the Italian attack. This was launched on 9 March, under General Carlo Geloso and started with heavy bombardment of Greek positions by Italian artillery and aircraft. The assaults were carried out by 11 infantry divisions and the 131st Centauro Armoured Division.

The attack was mainly directed against the 1st, 2nd, 5th, 11th, 15t and 17th divisions of the Greek Army, and was followed by repeated infantry assaults. Intense fighting occurred between the rivers Osum and Vjosë, an area dominated by the Trebeshinë heights. On 14 March, Italian General Ugo Cavallero, realizing that the attacks were failing to break through the Greek lines, advised Mussolini to stop the offensive. Fierce fighting occurred on a height codenamed "731", which was unsuccessfully assaulted by the Italians at least 18 times. On the other hand, the Greek forces implemented a strategy of active defense, which included counter-attacks when the Italians approached, and systematic exploitation of terrain advantage. A decisive factor for the final Italian defeat was that the Greek artillery could not be neutralized, along with the high morale of the Greek troops.
