Kharkov - March 1943 BV

The threat of our armies in Southern Russia being encircled has been countered. We destroyed or severely damadged 4 Soviet Armies and regained most of the territory lost in January. Prepare your troops for a Summer offensive near Kursk.

The Kharkov scenario and the map on which it is played are created by Hannes Gruber. Slight modifications were made: deployment hexes, supply hexes and prestige management.
