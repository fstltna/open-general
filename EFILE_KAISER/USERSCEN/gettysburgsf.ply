Battle of Gettysburg

July 1, 1863

During the Lee's second invasion of the Union states, the Conferedacy got some major victories which fueled the hopes of Richmond to kick out the US Goverment from prosecuting the war. The Lee's astounding victory at Chancelorsville and later the succesful campaign at the Shenandoah valley, drove the CSA armies to a deep advance into the North, even into Pennsylvania. President Lincoln sent the maj. gen. J. Hooker to pursuit the Confederate advance, just to replace him by the maj. gen. G.G. Meade three days before the battle. In July the 1st of 1863, both armies began to clash at a town of Pennsylvania: Gettysburg, thus, begining the biggest battle on the North American soil of the whole known history up to now.
