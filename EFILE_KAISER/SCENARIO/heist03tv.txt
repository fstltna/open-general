Major,

The raids have left their toll on the border provinces.  They are seen as very serious threats to the security of Estonia in Tallinn:  they may be precursors to an invasion by the Soviet Union.

You have been promoted to the rank of Major.  You still remain in command of the 1st regiment.  However, HQ is prepared to allocate more resources to your command.
