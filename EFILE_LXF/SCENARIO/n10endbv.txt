For a moment those fools from the west must have really thought they could ambush us? Us?!  Communist warriors?  Never!  I will leave you alone for a few hours to get some sleep.  You look pale, Comrade General.

AFTERMATH

Operation Courageous consisted of an advance from Seoul north and an airborne drop by the reinforced 187th Airborne RCT.  However, communist officers had foreseen this action and when the UN forces attacked, the bulk of the communist forces were already north of the Imjin River.  Now the UN forces were full on the offensive again. Operations Rugged and Dauntless would push the frontline over the 38th Parallel running from the western coast along the Imjin River to Kumhwa and from there east across the peninsula.  Even now the communists were massing and preparing for their spring offensive.
