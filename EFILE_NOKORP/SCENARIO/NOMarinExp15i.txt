Time to divert the American's attention from our Japanese allies again.
You'll start with these two easy objectives: A new submarine base, still under construction, and the short wave radio broadcast station which the Americans use to send their annoying propaganda over the Atlantic. Neither should be a problem, a couple bombs and that's it.
According to our intelligence the submarine base is in one of the western fjords of the peninsula, and the radio station must be near the mouth of the river SW of there.

That's just a beginning, for you will strike again just after that. Last time the Americans didn't react much, we need to really draw their attention this time.
This means this is only the first strike, and for this reason you need to be careful with your troops, the only repairs you'll get for a while are those you'll be able to do with your own means, and the next mission will be much more difficult.
High command has given you an experienced Jäger unit, you might need it in those wild, uncivilized places.




Instructions: Destroy the submarine base and the radio station. You get a additional free core unit.
Beware, your units won't autorepair at the end of this scenario, and you won't be able to buy or upgrade for quite some time, being tied up very far from home.
