Attack on Moscow 

On November, 15th the replenished Panzer Group 4, commanded by General Hoepner proceeded towards the Russian capital via Volokolamsk. Despite fierce resistance the Soviet 16th Army (General Rokossovsky) could not reject the German assault and had to withdraw slowly towards the Istra river. 

On November, 23th the situation became very critical for Rokossovsky's troups, for the important city of Solnechnogorsk was conquered by parts of the 2nd Panzer Division. The decisive stage of the battle for Moscow began.
