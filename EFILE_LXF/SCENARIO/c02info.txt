02. BRNO 1 (26 October 1938)

The past three weeks have proven the original plan has failed. The Czechs keep defending organized and we are not even close to Prague. After your spectacular victory at Vienna, we have directed forces to Austria for a push from your bridghead over the Dyje River to the heart of Moravia. 2nd Panzer Division has broken through already and has almost encircled the city of Brno. If we can exploit this gap, we can attack Prague from behind.

You must rush to the battle. 2nd Panzer has driven around of Brno as heavy opposition is expected, but their supplies are very low. We are expecting a Czech relief force for the city which has to be stopped in its path. Your task is to capture Brno and assist 2nd Panzer in capturing Olomouc in the north and reach the mountain passes in west which give access to the central plains of Bohemia, where Prague lies. It is essentially you succeed: only then our new plan can work.
