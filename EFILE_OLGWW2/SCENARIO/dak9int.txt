El Alamein, Montgomery Attack

October 23rd, 1942

The situation is becoming really dangerous, we have an important lack of fuel and tanks, and the enemy has air superiority. Also the minefileds, are inflicting big losses on our units... We will launch a last hit to the British, hoping to surprise them like in the past - otherwise you must fight at any cost, until the last man!.

Historically, the British had decoded the German ''Enigma'' codes and knew all the German plans, Montgomery was able to make special plans to force out the Germans from El Alamein. Marshall Rommel didn't follow the order to fight at any cost and in November the 12th, he started the retreat of the DAK.
