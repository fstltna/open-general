Kerenski's plan has ended in a disaster. Russian soldiers refuse to fight anymore and they are simply deserting or, even worse, joining the revolutionaries. I wouldn't be surprised if the Bolsheviks took power before the end of the year. I can almost feel pity for this former great country and its cruel ending, but it's a war after all. It was them or us.

We must take advantage of this situation. Knowing that the Russians can barely defend themselves, we'll launch an offensive against Riga, the pearl of the Baltic. Maybe that will finally convince Kerenski to give in before it's too late for him.
