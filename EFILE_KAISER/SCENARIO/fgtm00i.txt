Battle of the Yalu River
18th April (1st May) 1904
Gospodin Polkovnik, welcome to Korea.  Following the breakdown of negotiations, the Japanese Empire has declared war and has begun preparations for landing her army in Korea.  The Russian Empire's sphere of influence in the region rests on Port Arthur:  a fortress on the western coast of northern Korea.  It will be the aim of Japan's army to capture this fortress and expell our presence from the region.

The Japanese 1st Army landed on the western coast of northern Korea with the aim of isolating and besieging Port Arthur.  The Yalu River is our first line of defense.   Your regiment will be part of General Zasulich's force of 6 Siberian regiments and a Cossack squadron.  Your task is to fight a delaying action.  You will be reinforced by units posessing a new weapon:  the machine gun.  Perhaps you can utilize this device to your advantage on the battlefield.
