Comrade General, here lies the German capital of Berlin.  You have been selected by party officials to lead the attack.  

A British volunteer corps has arrived to assist the defenders of the city, and we suspect that the Germans are well-entrenched. The 5th Division will assist your forces.  Make mother Russia proud, comrade.
