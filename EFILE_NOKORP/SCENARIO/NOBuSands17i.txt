All right, it has come to this. This is our last stand, if we fall back once more we'll get pushed into the sea  in Tunis. We need to resist and retake the initiative.

Wadi Akarit is a good place to defend: Stuck between the salt marshes and the sea, the space to defend is small and forces the attacker to try a frontal attack.

Beware, we're vastly outnumbered and outgunned, only your tactical skills can save the day.
