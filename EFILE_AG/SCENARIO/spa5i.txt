Battle near Salinae Heraclea

Spartacus, now you have to prove yourself in the fight against Varius's legacy Cossinius.
His troops have theur camp at Salinae Hercalea. Prepare your wild bunch for it !!!

Historical:
After Spartacus had defeated Varinius lieutenant Furius, he encountered the troops of Varinius' legat Cossinius. He carefree had a bath, while Spartacus blasted his troops at Heraclea Salinae.
He fled into his fortified camp but was killed when Spartacus's forces overrun it in the flush of victory.

Since the position of Salinae Heraclea is not known, I made the better-known map of Herculaneum.
