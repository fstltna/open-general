Historical Info:

The Island of Pantelleria, in the Sicilian Narrows separating Sicily from Tunisia was strongly fortified and garrisoned from 1937 on. Benito Mussolini, the Italian dictator, saw in Pantelleria an Italian counterpart to the British bastion of Malta some 120 miles (195 km) to the Italian island’s south-east.
