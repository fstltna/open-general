10. WLADIWOSTOK (10 March 1920)

After two years of struggle getting through Russia, the Czech Legion had finally reached Wladiwostok and all what was left was waiting on ships to take them home, as initially there were not sufficient ships to take all back home at once.

You have get to Wladiswostok by passing American and Japanese zones of occupation. No more fighting is needed! You are going home!!!
