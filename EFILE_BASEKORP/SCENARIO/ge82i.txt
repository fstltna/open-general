Herr General, as you know the Allies landed in Northwest Afrika in November and have been been driving east ever since.  It is imperative not only that their drive be stopped, but that they be thrown out of Tunesia!  We thought to assign this task to Feldmarschall Rommel, but Feldmarschalls Kesselring and Manstein have argued that he is needed to continue the drive on the Suez Kanel.  We have therefore given you this critical assigment.  Herr General, do not disappoint.
