The artillery barrage and the initial assault against the German VII Reserve Corps (von Soden) caused serious casualties to the 21st and 43rd Reserve divisions.  Beremicourt and Brimont were captured, but a violent counter-attack by the German X Reserve Corps (Eberhardt) threw the French back from Beremicourt.

After the assault, the Russian brigade participated in solidifying the French line and was withdrawn to the 5th Army's rear.  In brief, the French Nivelle Offensive failed with serious consequences:  demoralized, many French soldiers refused to obey their officers' orders, and a crisis hung over the entire French Army.  The Russian brigades were not spared the effects of revolution and disenchantment:  soldiers from both brigades mutineed in June of 1917.  The participation of Russian soldiers in the war on the Western Front did not end in June of 1917, however.  By April 1918 the Russian Legion was formed from volunteers and grew to a battalion-sized assault unit during the remainder of the war.  The Russian Legion earned the admiration of French commanders and served with the Moroccan Division.
