--PUBLIC BROADCAST - 4 JAN 2054-

--ATTENTION ALL ARM FORCES--
*We have lost the battle but not the war.  The rule of the Council is over.  However, the traitor Phoenix is still at large.
*If you are loyal to your country and your people, you will report to the highest ranking officer and await further orders.
*If you cannot find an officer of the Arm, find the nearest rebel soldiers.  Report to the rebel officers as you would to an officer of the state.  They will not harm you.
*We are all on the same side now.  The people trust you to do the right thing.  This broadcast repeats.
