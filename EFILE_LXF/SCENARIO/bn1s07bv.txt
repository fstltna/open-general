General Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb

Bravo, General Major! You stopped all attacks and did not yield any ground. The counterattack is progressing well. Once again you displayed unbelievable courage and leadership with your paratroopers. You are being pulled back from the front and are being sent to Germany to prepare for an operation in the Mediterranean area.
