Peipus Raids
November 20, 1918

Kolonelleitnant, your expertise and the experience of your troops are needed at the training grounds of the 3rd regiment outside of Vyru on Lake Peipus.  There have been reports of violations of our borders by the Red Army.  Their raids have left many civilians dead, and it is up to you to protect them.  Battalions from the 4th Narva regiment and from the 2nd Tartu regiment will be ready to provide assistance if the Soviets violate the border.

Good luck, Kolonelleitnant.
