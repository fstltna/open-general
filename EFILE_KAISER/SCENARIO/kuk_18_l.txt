This is terrible, General. We've lost our last opportunity to kick Italy out of the war. Now we must go on the defensive again. We'll probably stop them for some time, but if the Entente powers insist on attacking us, in the end we'll have to capitulate. The maritime blockade is hurting us too much, and sooner or later we won't have any resources left to keep on fighting. Your failure has doomed the Empire.
