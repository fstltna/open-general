VICTORY

Great work, General.  We've made a deep penetration into the enemy's rear....ahem.  Now two fresh armoured divisions of Poles and Canadians are to take over for a new offensive to capture Falaise, while your brave men get some much needed rest.  Oh and if you bump into any Poles on your way, don't broach the subject of Latin American politics - for some reason the subject really winds them up!
