06. KAZAN - RED OFFENSIVE (27 October 1918)

The loss of Kazan had generated into enormous bolshevik activity to stop the Czech Legion from capturing more cities and advance across the Volga River towards Moscow. Leon Trotski himself would conduct the preparations.

The Soviet assembled their Fifth Army under General Tukhachevsky, which later lead the invasion of Poland and become victim of Stalin's purges. The Fifth Army had reached the Volga River and was now ready to recapture Kazan. 

You must hold Kazan and hold the enemy at bay. We have no intentions of advancing towards Moscow but we will not be defeated. Also hold open the railroads to the Ural mountains.
