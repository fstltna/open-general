Armageddon - Final Battle Between The Oder And The Elbe


Replay some of the fiercest battles of the Second World War.
Early in 1945 the Soviets arrived at the Oder river. The Germans threw in their last reserves to stop the final assault on Berlin.

Expect bad weather, rough terrain and understrengthened units.

Many thanks to all the people who have helped with designing, testing and other stuff.
Especially to Leon who provided me the complete Soviet Order of battle and Devils Brigade who was my first playtester.
