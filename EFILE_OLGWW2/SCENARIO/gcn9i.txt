Road to Barcelona

Orders from: Burgos, December, 1938

Sientese por favor, y atienda mis ordenes.  As you may know General the war is about to end.  We need  to inflict one more blow to the badly wounded enemy forces the so-called ''People's Army''.  The very best of the remaining enemy forces are located at Catalonia.   It is the last Republican stronghold in direct contact with a foreign border.  We know the French are debating on whether to intervene and send the Republicans some Soviet weapons that have been blocked at the French boarder.  This is unacceptable as it will allow them to prolong the war.  This would be disastrous for the National cause if a new World War finally exploded.

The main objective is to take Barcelona.  It is the last important Republican city as their government is located there.  By taking Barcelona we may be able to put an end to this bloody war.  The Republicans are trying to build fortified lines in Catalonia so we are going to need to use the German tactics of troop concentration, close air and artillery support to quickly overwhelm them.
