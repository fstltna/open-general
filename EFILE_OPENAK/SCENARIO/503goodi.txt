07. Normandy - Operation Goodwood - The death ride of the armoured divisions 18 July 1944

Herr Major. The Allies have landed in Normandy on June 6th 1944, more then a month ago. For the last few weeks, British and Canadian forces have slowly been taken ground from us around the city of Caen - to your North/West. From our positions on elevated ground, we can see them preparing a tank heavy attack on your positions. Be aware of heavy fighter bomber attacks and hold your ground.

Troops from 21 Panzer Division are moving closer to the front and will arrive at Troarn in the next few hours (turn 2). A regiment of 711 Infanterie Division on bicycles is on its way from the coast to assist you. Expect no other reinforcements.

TACTICAL ORDERS
At the end of the 12 turn scenario, hold 4 VH for Brilliant Victory, 3 for Victory and 2 for Tactical Victory. Any lower number will result in Loss.  

NOTES: 
- Units will not be automatically reinforced to strength 10 at the end of the scenario.
