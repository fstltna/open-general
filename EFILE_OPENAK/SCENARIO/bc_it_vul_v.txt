VICTORY

Great display, General.  With the annihilation of the German Afrika Korps we can now begin the long, arduous task of liberating Europe from the tyranny of leather shorts, sausages and foul-smelling cabbage.  Oh and we'll give the pasta munchers a bloody good seeing too while we're at it.  Pip pip!
