Beersheba, 31st October 1917
----------------------------------------------
After General Murray was relieved of his command in April, our new commander-in-chief, General Sir Edmund Allenby - a tall, heavy cavalryman nicknamed "The Bull" due to his physics and his explosive temper - has filled our army with new enthusiasm and developed a new plan to finally overcome the Gaza Line.
Instead of waging another fruitless frontal assault on Gaza, there will be only a feint attack on the city. The main thrust will take place on the extreme left flank of the enemy, at Beersheba. With this town in our hands, we should have an open flank against which to operate, and full use could be made of our superiority in mounted troops. Moreover, a success here offered prospects of pursuing our advantage, and forcing the enemy to abandon the rest of his fortified positions.

While XXth Corps will attack between the Khalassa Road and the Wadi Saba south-west of the town, our mounted troops will make a wide flanking movement, secure the Hebron Road and attack Beersheba from the east and north-east. It is essential that Beersheba is in our hands before nightfall, since it posesses the only wells in the area.

NOTE: You will be able to buy experienced units in this scenario, reflecting the reinforcements that came to Palestine from the Salonika Front.
