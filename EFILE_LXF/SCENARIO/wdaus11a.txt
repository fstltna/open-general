Situation report: The combined offensive of our Allied forces has been forced to a standstill by heavy Japanese resistance to the south of Lae and Salamaua. Hopefully, an influx of fresh units can break the stalemate.

Operational orders: Your forces are being sent to reinforce our units at the front. Your first task will be to break the Japanese assaults on our positions to enable a return to an offensive stance. Once this has been achieved, you must attempt to capture the Japanese stronghold at Salamaua.
