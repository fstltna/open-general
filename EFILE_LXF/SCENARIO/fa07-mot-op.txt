Welcome to the north, Majuri! Your presence is more than welcome.
Situation report: We have surrounded the 163rd Rifle division and due to our superior Motti-tactic we have cut the Soviets into two pockets. You must quickly wipe the northern pocket out and then turn down south to support my 9th Division. Together we will assault Suomussalmi.
Enemy: The 163rd Rifle division with all additional units in the Suomussalmi area.
Our forces: Your troops and my 9th Division.

Good to have you here.
