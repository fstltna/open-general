Disaster - after Bardia also Tobruk has fallen into English hands and XXII Corps has surrendered. 

Your forces are transfered to XX Corps - the remains of 10th Army. General Tellera is in charge of the withdrawal of troops from the Gebel into Sirte. General Babini's armored forces retreated from the El-Mechili area to your area near the coast after they clashed with elements of the 7th Armored Division. They report English columns moving through the desert towards the coast. If we don't move fast, they could cut-off our route of escape.
