Kolonel, under your leadership, the young Estonian army has claimed her first major victory in this war.

Your experience with the Soomusrong has been a valuable one.  The armored trains add explosive power to your offensive, but they can be extremely vulnerable in maneuver.  Use them wisely in your upcoming campaign:  without adequate supporting units and a clear retreat path, an armored train can become an expensive loss.

The activity of the Soviet ChK has alarmed our intelligence:  these elite units seem capable of organizing strong resistance behind front lines.  With few military resources to spare across wide expanses of front line, you should take care to protect your supplies and HQ.
