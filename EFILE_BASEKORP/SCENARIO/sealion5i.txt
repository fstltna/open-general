Isle of Wight

Orders:

Bad weather in the Strait of Dover delayed our invasion and gives us the chance to take the Isle of Wight and further get control over the important ports of Southampton and Portsmouth. You and your men will carry out this commando raid. HQ will send you reinforcements but it is uncertain when they'll arrive.

Historical Info:

During the Second World War the island was frequently bombed by the Luftwaffe. Close to France, the island hosted observation stations and transmitters, as well as the RAF radar station at Ventnor. It was the starting-point for one of the earlier Operation Pluto pipelines to feed fuel to Europe after the Normandy landings.
