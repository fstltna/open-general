Your early capture of Washington has forced the surrender of the United States before they could successfully test an atomic bomb. North America and Europe have been successfully united under common leadership and all the other nations of the world are courting German favor. The world is at peace.Your brilliant leadership throughout this war ranks you among the greatest generals that have ever lived, and you will be remembered as the greatest Panzer General in history.
