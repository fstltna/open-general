Tula is ours, and in the east the news are even better: our forces have started a counteroffensive and have taken Saratov. In a few days the Armed Forces of Southern Russia will link with Kolchak. At last we'll be united! 
I'm completely sure that, very soon, Moscow will fall. Denikin has chosen me for leading the final assault.
