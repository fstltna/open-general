The Germans again proved their resilience and combative spirit and that, added to the terrible weather and the muddy terrain, prevented us from obtaining the breakthrough that we had been trying to gain for so long. The third battle of Ypres became one of the bloodiest in the war. After three months of fighting, and just like it had happened at the Somme, our advances were minimal, and the Germans were severely weakened, but not destroyed.

Some of Haig's enemies still claim that it was his faulty strategy, and not the weather, the reason why the Germans managed to survive, but those opinions are ill-conceived. Haig was known by his belief in careful and thorough planning, and his staff was probably the best in the Army. His main defect was, actually, the opposite: his hesitation to admit that, too often, reality can spoil even the best of plans, and it is no use keeping on trying. Third Ypres was one of the best exmples of that truth.
