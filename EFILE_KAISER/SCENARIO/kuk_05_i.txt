Expedition against Montenegro

Jan 5th, 1916

When Serbia was defeated, Montenegro should have stepped aside and declare his neutrality. Instead, this tiny, stubborn kingdom chose to stay with their old allies, the Serbs, and now they'll suffer the same fate.

The Montenegrin army is blocking our march towards Albania, in the south, where the remnants of the Serbian army are staying. We must clear the way, and a classical pincer maneuver should work. While the XIX Korps attacks the coastal towns, you'll storm the enemy positions at the mountains. Once you've succeeded, both groups will converge in Podgorica and Montenegro will be ours.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.
