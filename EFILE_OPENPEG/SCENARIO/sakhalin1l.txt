The magnitude of your loss is immense. The People’s Republic of China has gained the upper hand in the Russian Far East. The threat from expanded Chinese air power on the island has halted the advance on Vladivostok while our reserves must be diverted north to guard the Tartar Strait. It will be some time before we can regroup for another assault. You will be serving stateside when that happens.
