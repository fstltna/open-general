The British defences were too strong for you and your men. I guess that we underestimated the Kakies. Fortunately we could send fresh troops from the North in time, and after relieving you they could finally overcome our enemies, who were already quite weakened. Those were our last reserves, so the next time you can't expect a rescue.
