Well done commander! 

Historical Info:

After a final heavy bombardment from the air and the sea, the island’s garrison was twice invited to surrender. There was no reply, so the British troops were landed, and the italian commander Pavesi then capitulated, having been authorised to do so in the course of the preceding night.

The Axis losses totalled 56 Italian soldiers killed and another 116 wounded, and 11,621 Italians and 78 Germans taken prisoner. The sole British casualty was a man bitten by a mule.
