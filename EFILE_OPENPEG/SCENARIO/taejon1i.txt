Taejon, South Korea
The People’s Republic of China has promised the North Koreans reinforcements to launch another offensive. Our hold on the port of Pusan is too tenuous to take a defensive posture, and we need to push out of this corner before the weight of the Chinese army arrives. It is crucial that you capture Taejon, secure the roads north to Choch’iwan, and clear western coast of the peninsula north to Hongsong.
