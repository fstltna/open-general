TACTICAL VICTORY

Good job. We once again have all look-outs under control so we can overlook the enemy's movements. The threat for an invasion has been countered. Merauke will stay in Dutch hands!

AFTERMATH:
Late 1943 your force is being shipped to Australia first and second to England to join with the Dutch citizens all over the world that have assembled in England to form the Prinses Irene Brigade which will take part in the re-conquest of Europe. Your force lands at Normandy early in August 1944. Besides a few minor skirmishes your force sees no action until being part of the ground army of Operation Market-Garden in September 1944 on Dutch soil once again!
