Where's Wenck?

04/30/1945

After a short rest, the Germans resumed their attack trying to manage the last kilometers to the front of General Wenck's 12th Army. Guided by Wenck's radio they headed for the town of Beelitz.
From the Reichskanzlei desperate radio messages were sent:
"Request immediate report. 
1. Of the whereabouts of Wenck's spearheads.
2. Of time intended to attack.
3. Of the location of the Ninth Army. 
4. Of the precise place in which the Ninth Army will break through. 
5. Of the whereabouts of General Rudolf Holste's XLIth Panzerkorps."

But there was no hope. Wenck never had the plan to attack (or the power). Busse was surrounded and Holste was on the defensive. Hitler's last plan for breaking the encirclement of Berlin failed due to the developments in reality.

15 deploy hexes. New units have strength 5. German units are short on ammo and fuel. You have to hold or capture all victory hexes.
