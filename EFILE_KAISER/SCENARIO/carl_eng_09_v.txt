Overwhelmed by the numbers, you could not do more than repeat and multiply the admirable proofs of your courage. I can not, nor want to deal with the enemy. But I love you too much to let unnecessarily spill even a drop of your blood.

I resolved, therefore, stop fighting. If success has not crowned our efforts for now, this does not diminish the greatness of our task, nor clouds the heroic deeds that you have undertaken to carry it out. You have been soldiers worthy of a Cause like mine, and your deeds will place you at a great height. In our  immortal history  the names of your victories will be inscribed with dazzling letters. My Spaniard pride grows with the show of your courage, and my heart of King will keep eternal gratitude to your dedication and your sacrifice.
 
The numbers and trickery  have been able to defeat me for a while, but I have not surrendered. I maintain, intact and complete, my rights, and wrapped in my flag, you will always find me ready to sacrifice my life for the good of Spain.

Carlos VII, February 27, 1876
