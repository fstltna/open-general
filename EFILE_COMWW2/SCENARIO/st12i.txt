January 2 1942

Herr General:  finally General von Paulus has agreed to take an active role in this operation! Feld-Marschall von Manstein has given precise orders for the conduct of Operation Thunderclap: General von Paulus will gather up what fuel and ammo he can, and then attempt to break out of the encirclement and reach safety, sector by sector, at the same time as you are trying to break in. Our Romanian friends are expected to arrive in the next few days to lend what assistance they can to this operation. It is true we defy the Fuhrer's orders in pursuing this, but our higher duty is to the Fatherland!

VICTORY CONDITIONS:

Capture Rynok, Borodkin, and Bereslavka Outpost, and also ensure the survival of a minimum of 1 marked unit...
