Libyan Expedition

Part 1/3 of the "In der Wueste und auf Kreta" minicampaign




Our Italian allies have undergone several defeats during last weeks and there's a danger of their complete failure. I think that I don't need to overly emphasize the importance of a secure southern flank for our upcoming campaign. Moreover, if the Brits gain total control of North Africa and Mediterranean basin, their supply lines will improve drastically.

Herr General, there's not much that OKH can offer us, but we all know that your brigade was seriously depleted during the previous campaigns, but we believe that your skills and experience will compensate for the lack of men and equipment.

Your first task is an attack in this sector. Commonwealth forces consist of two tank battalions with appropriate support. Every time the Italians tried to enter the region, the Brits counterattacked and routed them with little effort. I pity the Italians, they are courageous and skilled, but their vintage tanks are museum pieces and can't do much against phenomenal British armour. Especially when Brits have air dominance over the battlefield.




Victory condition: Capture all VHs.

Hint: As you have realized during the Western campaign, Allied tanks are very powerful, same as their planes. 

Core reinforces (3/3): You will be awarded a "choice unit" depending on a result of the previous scenario.
