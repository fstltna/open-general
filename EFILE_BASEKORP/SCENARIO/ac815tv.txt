Welcome back General.

Your liberation of Basarabia was no small task, the Russians fought hard no?

Your punch through the Russian right flank showed your troop's understanding of blitzkrieg, despite your countries rather light equipment, we must urge Italy & Germany to share Tank designs.

The Romanian Troops showed signs of wavering but finally took heart by your tenacious example and finished off the Russian remnants.

I understand that you will conduct anti-partisan duty, a distasteful yet necessary task.

Good Luck.
