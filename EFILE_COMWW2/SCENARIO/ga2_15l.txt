As Operation Fruhlingserwachen ran out of steam, the Soviets launched a massive counter offensive, the Vienna Operation, on March 15 1945. By March 20, the Wiking were almost completely encircled.

On March 24, another Soviet attack pushed the exhausted Wiking back towards Vienna. Any semblance of an organised line of defence was gone. The 5th SS Wiking then executed a fighting withdrawal into Czechoslovakia, and by early May, they were within reach of the American forces, to whom the division officially surrendered near Furstenfeld, Austria on May 9 1945....
