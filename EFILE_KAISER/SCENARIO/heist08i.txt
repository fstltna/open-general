Rakvere
January 12, 1919

Brigaadikindral, your promotion places you in command of the northern wing of our counter-offensive against the Red Army.  You must capture two important cities along the Tallinn-Narva railroad (Rakvere and Sami) and eliminate the Russian garrison at the port of Letipea.  In this operation you will combine breakthrough maneuver on land and railroad and an amphibious operation.

You must form a marine detachment (3 units) out of specially trained infantry and MG units.  Our Finnish allies have promised to send a detachment of their 1st regiment, so expect their help shortly.  Intelligence reports that the Russians have unloaded siege guns-most likely en route to Tallinn earlier-at the port of Letipea.  Don't let these catch your transports in the water!

Tactically, this task is challenging.  Intelligence reports that the full 46th Soviet regiment has taken positions somewhere between Rakvere and the Baltic Sea.  In addition, their 1st cavalry regiment has stopped in the area en route to the front line.  Also, remnants of battered regiments are filtering through our lines to rejoin their comrades.  Beware of their sudden appearance on your flanks!
