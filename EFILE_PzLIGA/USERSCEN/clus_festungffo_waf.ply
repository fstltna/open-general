Clu's Fortress Frankfurt v. 1.1 - Waffen Equiptment

A historically (nearly) correct scenario.

In the morning of April 16, 1945, the Soviet attack on Berlin began. While the 1st Ukrainian Front (Konev) in the south is advancing quickly, the attack of the 1st Belorussian Front (Shukov) gets stuck in front of Seelow. 
In the Frankfurt area, hard fighting is reported west of the Reitwein Spur and around the Soviet bridgehead at the Eichwald (Oak Wood). The Fortress itself is left quite untouched. 
Historically the Germans, favored by the terrain, achieved a defense victory. But due to the Soviet deployment north and south, the fortress character was eventually obsolete by April 22 -23. The forces found their end in the Halbe pocket. 

Will the Soviets break through? Or are the Germans able to hold their front?
