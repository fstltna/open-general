Visiting Berlin

Choice Scenario 


"Otto! Otto! Here, up in the window!

So, you're a famous man now, don't you? Maybe too famous... Come in and sit down for a cup of tea...!

Otto, you've made yourself several very influential rivals. There are people... yes, high ranks, very high ranks... there are people envious of your achievements. Annoying, I know. But I think that we've found a way out. We? Yes, I already spoke to some friends. You know what? Now when the French campaign is over and the invasion of Britain is not in sight, what about a little vacation, heh? We may hide you in the academy... Calm down! Listen... Calm down, please and listen! Look, it'll be proof of your slim ambitions and this will soothe your rivals. Once the time comes, we'll help you to gain the brigade back under your command, trust me!

After all, they didn't promote you for fun and your experience  is still valued. So, what do you say now?"


Victory condition: Capture three VHs for a BV, two for a V and one for a TV.

Hint: Now when you have lots of off-duty time, maybe it'll be wise to visit some of your rivals and change them into friends. I know that it's really humiliating, but you may need their help in the future... or at least neutrality... instead of open hostility.
Because of the f/f feature, the next few scenarios have slightly limited upgrade choices. Exploit this knowledge during the HQ...
Decide for yourself if you wish to make one very influential friend, or rather several of them, but less influential. Check the VHs names for... another hint, of course.
