The First World War - Krivolak - 21st, Oct. 1915

Ma chère Fabienne,

It was bad enough that our offensive in the Dardanelles stalled, but when last week Bulgaria finally decided to side with the Central Powers, our position in the Eastern Mediterranean became really dangerous.

It's a pity that we couldn't convince Bulgaria to join our side. They have a big and experienced army, with good officers, although with outdated equipment. They would have been excellent allies, but Serbia's intransigency ruined all our negotiation attempts.

Now the Serbians are paying the price. In just a few days the German, Austrian and Bulgarian offensive has routed their army, and conquered most of their country. They are approaching the borders with Albania and Greece, and that could be a disaster. Many Greek Monarchists are pro-German, and they could convince King Konstantinos to join the Central Powers, too. 
In order to prevent this, and with the help of the liberal Vevizelist Greeks, we have basically invaded that country. Now we are in Macedonia, ready to confront the Bulgarians and stop their offensive before it's too late. 

Frankly, I'm tired after so many months far from home, fighting in this primitive lands. I miss you very much. Sometimes I wish I could retire, and stay with you forever. But then I realize that it would be a selfish act. The future of the French people, of our children and grandchildren, is at stake. And that includes the fighting in the Balkans. I hope I'll return to France soon, but in the meantime I must stay here. However foolish it may sound, thoughts of you are a great relief for my old soul right now. Everyday I remember how we met, how young we were, and all the great times that we've lived together since then.
 
I must stop writing now. Je t'embrasse,

Jean-Babtiste.
