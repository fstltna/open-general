Historical Note: Operation Veritable, which began on 8 Feb 45, and later, Operation Blockbuster, 25 Feb 45, were designed to overcome the three defensive German lines built within the 30 km gap between the Maas and Rhine Rivers east of Nijmegen. Also known as the Siegfried Lines, these German positions consisted of trenches, anti-tank traps and wire belts which ran between towns and farmhouses. Behind the lines was German territory, including the cities of Cleve, Goch, Calcar, Geldern and Xanten. The plan was to clear the area west of the Rhine river, then link up with American forces pushing up from the south, (Operation Grenade 23 Feb 45). During this month of fighting, the First Canadian Army lost 15,634 killed, wounded or missing, including 5,304 Canadians, but they had gained the banks of the Rhine which marked the last major line of German defence.
