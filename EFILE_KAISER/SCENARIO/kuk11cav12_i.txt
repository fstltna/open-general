Tölgyesi-szoros
(September 28, 1916)

Germany has sent three fresh divisions, commanded by General Falkenhayn, to stop the Romanian offensive. They are attacking toward Nagyszeben and Brassó (Southern-Transylvania). In the meanwhile your division is ordered to liberate and secure the valleys of the Eastern Carpathians.

ORDER: Keep your MSU alive and take all VHs.

NOTE: You can upgrade your Infantry after this scenario, but they will lose 25% experience, so use green replacements carefully.
