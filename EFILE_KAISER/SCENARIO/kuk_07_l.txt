Yes, your Highness, the General died from his wounds yesterday. He did his best to stop the Italians and, if we act quickly, I think that we can still use his battle plan to halt the enemy offensive. Yes, the funeral will take place tomorrow. I understand, sir. Yes, I really think that he deserves that posthumous title. After all, he'll be remembered as one of the greatest generals of the Empire.
