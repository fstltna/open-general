Sar Weha - Jan 18th, 1888

"And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held"
Rev. 6,9

Since 1885 the Mahdists had carried out sporadic border raids into Ethiopia. Tired of that, in January 1887 the King of Gojjam, Tekle Haymanot, who at that time was a loyal vassal of Yohannes, sacked the Sudanese border town of Gallabat.

In retaliation, the Mahdists invaded Ethiopia a few months later and, in June, they sacked Gondar, which had been the Imperial capital until 1855. In January 1888 they made a second attack against the same town, but this time Tekle Haymanot was ready to give battle. Yohannes had sent my army to reinforce him, so we were the last hope for the inhabitants of Gondar.

Victory conditions: 
Take all the VHs.
