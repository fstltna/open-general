Uzsok Pass, February 23, 1915
Gospodin General-Leitenant, the fighting in the Carpathian mountains has reached its crescendo of violence.  The Austrian 3rd (von Bojna) and German Sudost (von Linsingen) Armies have launched a desperate push to reach the besieged Przemysl.  Mobilizing their last reserves, the Austrians are forming ad-hoc divisions and brigades out of reserve MarchBatalionen, pouring inexperienced troops to fill the depleted ranks of standing divisions.  At Uszok Pass, the left wing of Linsingen's army -- Hofmann Corps -- are assaulting the heavily fortified positions of the 34th division in Kaledin's Svodny Corps (part of Brusilov's 8th Army).

The 34th division has been ordered to hold its position behind an extensive entrenchment network.  While the 34th holds, you must use the now famous 4th "Zheleznaya" ("Iron") Rifle Brigade (Denikin) to punch through the Austrian lines, stabilize our grip on the pass, and remove the threat of a German breakthrough toward Przemysl.  To accomplish this task, your men must hold the supply line intact to the 34th, while striking westward to remove the threat of the Austrian flank there.  If the enemy is able to capture any of your starting positions, this operation will be lost.  Do not let your comrades down!
