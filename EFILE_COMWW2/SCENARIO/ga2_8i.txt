Herr General, as you know, we were unable to fight our way past Malgobek to the main prize of Grozny, and instead, we switched the direction of our advance to come at it from the south. Now, on the outskirts of Ordzhonikidze, our spearhead has been snipped off. Your task is to make secure the area around the city of Gizel, while reinforcing the Corridor , thus temporarily preserving a path to allow 13th Panzer division to disengage its units and withdraw before they are completely encircled. Good luck, Herr General....

VICTORY CONDITIONS: 

Capture Alagir, Nart, Arhonskaja, and Gizel, and move 8 ground units into the Corridor at coordinates 28,22...
