Our victory in the Kuban is almost complete. Ekaterinodar is ours at last, and our army is growing. It won't be long until we can meet again. Hopefully, just a few months. I miss all of you very much, but I must still  be patient. Don't forget to tell Yuri and the girls that his father thinks about them every day. Tell them how we're fighting for our country, and for their future.

Goodbye dearest Katya, my first and only love...Believe me ever to be your devoted and loving husband,

Sergey
