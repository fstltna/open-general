You could not achieve your goals, the mission was a failure!

Saudi Arabia and Yemen agreed to a cessation of military hostilities on May 15, 1934. Britain mediated the signing of the Treaty of Taif by representatives of the countries on May 20, 1934, which provided for Yemeni recognition of Saudi Arabian sovereignty over Asir province and Najran district. Yemeni troops completed their withdrawal from the Asir province on June 27, 1934.

THE END!!!

Congratulations, you have completed the campaign!
