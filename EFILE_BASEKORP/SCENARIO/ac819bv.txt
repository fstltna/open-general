Come in General!  Incredible!

Your troops caught the Russians completely off guard, and that is the word of several Russian Officer prisoners that we have taken!

We have re-established our defenses on the Don, but 4th Panzer Army could not break through and Hitler refused to allow a withdrawl!  4th Panzer Army is withdrawling back across the Chir and has called a General Cousel to discuss Strategy.
Manstein will then fly to Berlin to directly persuade Hilter on the reality of the situation, Madness!
You must come to this meeting, and pray, pray that we come up with a plan that Hitler will accept!
