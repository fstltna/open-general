Aberdeen Proving Ground
December 19th, 1954
-------------------------------------------
Several of our agents in Moscow were recently killed attempting to retrieve information on the diversion of key Soviet elite units to new theaters.  Luckily, in their final moments one of them was able to relay a message to the spooks working stateside.  Commander, as audacious as it sounds, the Soviets have been planning an invasion of the Eastern United States, and they're about to carry out their mission.

The Soviets aren't dumb, Commander; they know they have no hope of sustaining a massive invasion on such far-strung logistics.  We believe their force is more of a raiding party than anything else, with limited objectives; and we believe their target is the device you recently secured in Greenland, which we have moved to the Aberdeen Proving Ground in eastern Maryland for safekeeping and analysis, overseen by yours truly.

Soviet forces have already made it ashore via unknown methods and reports indicate they are heading this way.

Commander, we still have no idea what this device is or what it can do.  It must be protected at all costs.  

Carter out.
