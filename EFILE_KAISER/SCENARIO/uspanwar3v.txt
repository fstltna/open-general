Congratulations!

The village of Silang is in our hands. The gate to reconquering Cavite is now open.

Considering the distinguished service to your country you will be recommended for promotion to "Coronel".

Historical background:

Silang was the first victory of the Spanish campaign of 1897 to recapture the territories of Cavite province which had fallen into Filipino hands in the early phase of the revolution in 1896. It was an important stronghold in the way to Imus, the seat of Aguinaldo's revolutionary government and the first main objective of the Spanish offensive.

Unlike Cuban mambises, Filipino rebels preferred open warfare to hit-and-run guerrilla warfare. They normally fortified themselves in villages and formidable trenches, forcing Spanish troops to storm the rebels' positions, with both sides suffering heavy casualties.

Despite tenacious Filipino resistance, Lachambre's troops recaptured Silang without major difficulties, forcing the rebels to retreat to Perez Dasmariñas in disorganized manner.
