Marshall! it is good to see you again, Please sit down.

The Allies have taken over the front to push through the Alps and into Germany.  YOUR Army is now going to be rested and refitted for a new operation.
You will lead the LIBERATION of Greece!  The Germans have kept all of our Italian brothers in the Balkans as POW slave labor, many have escaped to join the Greek partisans group - ELAS.
The Russians are now driving into the Balkans forcing a German withdrawl from Greece.....but they are taking the Italians POWs with them!  We must move quickly to rescue them and trap as many Germans south of Thermoplyae as possible.  We hope to negotiate a trade for POWs they already hold in Albania.  

STAFF INTEL: The Germans will have Mechanized reinforcements from the North and units comming from Crete via air from the south.  However, ELAS will mobilize to help scout our advance, and are ready for a sneak attack on the Southern Airfield.
