Beirut

Oct 10th, 1918

It seems that your Orient-Korps has arrived just in time! Just two weeks ago the British routed the Ottoman armies at Megiddo, and all the front line collapsed. Amman and Damaskus have fallen, as well as Beirut. Three days ago a French naval division disembarked in that town, and soon afterwards they linked with the British XXI Corps.

I know that you haven't had enough time to plan a decent strategy, but the situation right now is desperate. Your troops are the only reinforces available in all the Middle East. If you don't intervene, Turkey will surrender before the end of the month, since they can't resist any longer. You must counterattack immediately and retake Beirut. That should halt the British offensive, because the risk that they might be outflanked would become too high. Then we could think on our next move.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.

Special note: 
- You can buy Ottoman equipment in this scenario.
