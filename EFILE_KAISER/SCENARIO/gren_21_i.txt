Battle of the Selle

October 17th, 1918

The next summer eveything was ready for our final assaults on the Germans. In August, we broke the front lines and we recovered all the terrain thad had been lost during the German Spring Offensive. In September, the Hindenburg Line collapsed, and in October our enemies were retreating through the territory that they had gained in 1914. It had taken us four long, terrible years to go back to the battlefields where the British Expeditionary Force had had its baptism of fire. But now the circumstances were very different. Then, the Germans believed that they were unstoppable. Now, they were gathering their last forces in a desperate attempt to avoid a total rout, that could lead them to a general mutiny and to a revolution of unpredictable consequences.
