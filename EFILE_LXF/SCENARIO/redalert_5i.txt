Ah, Commander! Welcome. Let us get down to the matter at hand. One of our spies was recently captured deep in Soviet territory. He has vital information which is crucial to the war effort. One of our commando teams was able to rescue him, but is now encircled by Soviet troops. Lead your men in and rescue them before the Soviets can recapture them. On a more pleasant note, the Germans have joined us in the fight against communism after the success of the Polish operation.
