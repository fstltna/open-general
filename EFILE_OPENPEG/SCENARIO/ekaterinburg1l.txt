The U.S. did not invest its defense budget toward technological superiority for you to stumble blindly into battle like some Viking berserker with a blunt sword. The use of advanced weapon systems requires a degree of tactical expertise that you have failed to display. You will be relieved of command before you cause irreparable damage to the Coalition. It may already be too late after the loss of Ekaterinburg.
