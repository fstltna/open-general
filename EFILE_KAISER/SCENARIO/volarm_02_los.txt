Although my troops did their best, only with the arrival of our cossack reserves could we overcome the Bolsheviks. At least the railroad is clear of enemies now, we have taken lots of supplies, and many prisoners have joined our ranks. Tikhoretskaya will fall pretty soon, and then the way to Ekaterinodar will be open.
