November 4, 1944

Your victory at Debrecen made it possible for the 8th German and 2nd Hungarian Armies to escape from Transylvania. Unfortunately, the 2nd Ukrainian Front is only 90 km away from Budapest. We are expecting them to attack any minute. You must hold the Attila-line until all Axis troops arrive and prevent a Bolshevik lightning victory.

NOTE: You have 30 DHs. Hold 7 VHs for BV/DV, 6 for V and 4 for TV/MV.
