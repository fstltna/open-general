Ah, Herr General, excuse me, Herr Feldmarschall! As you know, our campaign in the north continues to go well.  You have been chosen to lead our invasion in the south.  After your beachhead is secure,  it is imperative for you to seize the port city of Savannah. Once this is accomplished, our drive inland will cut the United States in half.  It is believed that the Americans are ignorant of our plans.

We have committed the mightiest of our naval forces to this assault, forces that we cannot afford to lose.  If you win the battle on land, but lose our capital ships in the process, the battle will be lost.  You must preserve those ships.  They cannot be replaced.  We have also built up a substantial unterseeboot presence off the coast of Georgia.  You will have command of them as well for the duration of this battle.

We have managed to out maneuver the Allied naval fleets but intelligence reports indicate we will have to defend our landing forces from naval assault from British and Canadian ships in the north and possibly a small American battle group from the southeast.  Be prepared for this eventuality.  I would wish you good luck, but I expect intelligence and careful planning will serve you better.
