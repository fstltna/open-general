01. Rostov 2 (Samodurovka) (20 January 1943)

STRATEGIC SITUATION:
Thanks to your previous actions, large parts of the mobile First Panzerarmy were able to get safely back into the Ukraine on time, before their route of withdrawal through Rostov was cut off. At this moment the Russians are launching a large scale attack on the city, hoping to cut off the last retreating units. Non-mobile components of Heeresgruppe A are pulling back to the Taman peninsular instead of Rostov. But you must make sure that the last elements of 1st Pz can retreat to safety. That means that you must hold the Rostov Corridor open as long as possible - at least until 7 February. We will accept no less.

TACTICAL ORDERS:
Various Russian divisions are heading for Rostov and the Sea of Azov to cut the Rostov Corridor. You must hold down them down as long as possible. The retreating elements of 1st Pz Army are coming in from the south and can be used at the front but they are low on supplies, men and fuel. 

NOTES: 
- At the end of the scenario, hold 5 victory hexes for brilliant victory, 4 for victory and 3 for tactical victory.
- Units will be automatically reinforced to strength 10 at the end of the scenario.
