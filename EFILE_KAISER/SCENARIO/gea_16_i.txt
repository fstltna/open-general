The Last March

After the raid in Portuguese East Africa, Lettow decided to go to Northern Rodhesia to continue distracting Entente forces from the war in Europe. After a long march they arrived at Kasama and Chambesi, where notice of the Armistice arrived. Subsequently Lettow surrendered his forces at Abercorn in Nov 25 1918.
