Eben Emael

Good Day Herr General!

With the Dutch surrender our operations in the Netherlands have come to an end. 
Now it is up to Belgium! First we are to take Liege, an important traffic junction.
The problem is the - as the Belgians pretend - strongest fortress in the world, Eben Emael,  which blocks our ground foces. Well, we landed ON TOP of the fort from the air! I hope our Fallschirmjaeger and combat engineers can deal with those mighty bunkers!

Meanwhile our infantry is approaching from the east. The second crucial point, however, is to take the Blitzkrieg into the hinterland as fast as usual. Since Guderian and Reinhardt have most of our fast forces gathered in the Ardennes, there is only one Panzer division available! Anyhow, I'm confident that you will be able to enhance your prestige quickly in order to requisition some reinforcements.

Good luck, General!

Bonjour mon General!

The Boches actually do not shrink from attacking neutral countries again! Our northern neigbors are already defeated. I'm afraid we will be the next victims. 
The pride of our fortifications, Eben Emael, is being attacked from the air! We never imagined that ...
I can only advise you to contain the enemy long enough to give our French allies a chance to come to our aid. Then the 'Schlieffen plan' will not work for another time!

Bonne chance, mon General!
