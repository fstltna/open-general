"Good morning, general! I've heard that your brigade had quite a hard time last weeks. Believe me that even we do the best that we can, although the men of the frontline units may sometimes think otherwise. It's not that easy a task to bring you new stuff when it takes thousand kilometres for every last mantle to get from the depot to the respective soldier.

I'll try my best. But don't expect miracles..."
