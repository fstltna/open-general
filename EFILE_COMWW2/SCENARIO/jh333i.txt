Kiev
¯¯¯¯
Welcome Herr General! Kiev is important both strategically as well as politically, since it is considered to be the key to the Ukraine!  The Soviets have several large armies gathered near the city. You cannot hope to beat them frontally so we will encircle them. However, our intelligence report that most of the bridges have been destroyed by the Soviets, so prepare for a difficult river crossing. You have been given the southern wing - cut them off as fast as you can!
