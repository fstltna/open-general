Battle of Mahiwa

Finally the British pressure was too intense for the German army.  They retreated from the area of Kilwa and Lindi into the upper Lukuledi and the road between Liwale and Masasi. Von Lettow's last hope was to escape from the British and invade Portuguese East Africa.  He hoped to fine the much needed supplies for his men.

With General Wahle's force at Nyangao separated from Von Lettow-Vorbeck's troops, the British sought to cut off the force and destroy it. Thus they planned to cut off and surround Wahle's column by flanking it with the veteran Nigerian Brigade. With the destruction of Wahle´s force and the taking of Myangao and Mahiwa, Von Lettow Vobeck´s way of escape would be closed and he would have to surrender.  Aware of the danger, Von Lettow Vorbeck rushed to reinforce Wahle´s men. He knew that  General Beves would throw his men into action regardless of loss of life and favored repeated frontal attacks.   Von Lettow-Vorbeck planned a defensive strategy of local counterattacks that would inflict  severe losses on the British.
