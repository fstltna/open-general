Dardanelles, April 25th 1915 - BV

Congratulations! British and French troops are trapped in the beaches and will be forced to re-imbark. You have done an excellent job!

Historical outcome: After the initial landings, not much advantage was taken of the situation and most troops stayed on the beaches. The Turks had time to bring up reinforcements. The subsequent failure of the Entente's offensives, the persistent lack of progress, and the entry of Bulgaria into the war on the side of the Central Powers opening a second Mediterranean front at Salonika, made the Entente's position untenable and forced the evacuation of the peninsula.
