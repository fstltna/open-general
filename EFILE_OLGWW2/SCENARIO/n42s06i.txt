Herr General,

From the beginning their were a lot of doubts about operation Zitadelle. At first we delayed it for a few weeks in order to solve some of the mechanical problems our new tanks suffered. Then we heard of the great success of our forces in Sicily and decided to call the operation off, and decided to send some of the Panzer divisions against the offensive the Russians started in the south on July 17.

Now the Russians have started a great offensive of their own to capture Belgorod. We are forced to commit our Panzers there. The Soviets also started a smaller offenisive to the east of Charkov. Your XXII Pz div is to stop this at all costs.
