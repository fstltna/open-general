South off Wake Atoll, North Pacific
CO Admiral Shigeyoshi Inoue

Now the die is cast! After our attack on Pearl Harbor we are at war with the United States, the Netherlands, the Britain’s and their vassals. However, our first attempt to occupy Wake Island, cast doubt on the assumption that the Americans have only a low morale and combat effectiveness. We suffered heavy losses and our attack was a failure. The second attempt, under your leadership, should be more successful.

BACKGROUND

In January 1941, the United States Navy constructed a military base on the atoll. On 19 August, the first permanent military garrison, understrength elements of the 1st Marine Defense Battalion, totaling 450 officers and men, were stationed on the island, under Major James P.S. Devereux. Also present on the island were 68 U.S. Navy personnel and about 1,221 civilian workers for the Morrison-Knudsen Company. Forty-five Chamorro men were employed by Pan American Airways at the company's facilities in Wake Island, one of the stops on the Pan Am Clipper transPacific air service initiated in 1935.

The Battle of Wake Island began simultaneously with the Attack on Pearl Harbor and ended on 23 December 1941, with the surrender of the American forces to the Empire of Japan. It was fought on and around the atoll formed by Wake Island and its islets of Peale and Wilkes Islands by the air, land and naval forces of the Empire of Japan against those of the U.S., with Marines playing a prominent role on both sides.
