Well Herr General, you have earned a trip overseas.  We are going to the aid of our Italian allies in Somaliland. The Ethiopians, with UK aid are attacking. You must move swiftly before the UK can reinforce the natives.
All the airfields have been destroyed so it is important that you capture the last remaining airfield so your Luftwaffe can operate. I think the natives will crumble when faced with your seasoned troops!
