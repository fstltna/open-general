SPRING OFFENSIVE FIRST PHASE (22 April 1951)

This is the moment we have been waiting for, Comrade General.  The Chinese have prepared a huge force for an offensive aimed at destroying the capitalists!  Two North Korean Corps will attack near the eastern coast, while your Corps will attack along the western coast in the direction of Seoul.  The Chinese will attack in the middle.  The imperialists do have more guns, firepower and aircraft than we have but we have more men.  Most importantly are men are highly motivated.  This will overcome any obstacle!  Now go forward and liberate Korea!
