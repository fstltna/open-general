05. KAZAN (7 July 1918)

In the process of securing its own fate, the Czech Legion was capturing various cities. Within weeks the Volga River was reached and the city of Samara was taken. Next would be Kazan, famous for holding the Imperial Gold Reserve. A fact not lost for the Czech Legion.

From Samara, south of Kazan, you will once again use the railroad system to quickly reach Kazan and clear it of Bolsheviks. The Imperial Gold Reserve is also one of your goals. If we capture it, we have a very good negitiation position - with anyone.
