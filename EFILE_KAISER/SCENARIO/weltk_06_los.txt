Why have you been so slow? Almost a week has passed and you haven't achieved anything. All right, it doesn't matter, I understand. Paradoxically, that problem has been caused by our own artillery. The bombardment has been so heavy that the terrain has become impracticable. 
The situation is worrisome. Our troops can hardly move on the conquered ground, and they won't be able to take all the relevant defensive points before the French reinforcements arrive. So when the enemy deploys its reserves, our own soldiers will be exposed to artillery fire, too. They won't be safe and we'll suffer many casualties.
