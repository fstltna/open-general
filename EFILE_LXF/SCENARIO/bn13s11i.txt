
LILLE  - 24 MAY 1940

Mon general! The German Armies are pushing us back to the Channel coast from the south, east and north. There are rumours of a possible evacuation by sea. Nothing is confirmed so we will remain on our posts and do our duty!

Our 1st Army is slowly retreating back to the area of Dunkirk but are not nearly as mobile as the German Panzer Divisions and we are threatened with encirclement at Lille. You have been given order to assemble your force and retreat over the Lys River back to British lines. There will be many French troops that have to be left behind at Lille, but we have no choice. The Germans are close to sealing us off from the British already! Speed is vital. Good luck, mon general!

GOAL: Take all VH's!
