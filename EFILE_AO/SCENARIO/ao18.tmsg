
Commander, this is Carter. It looks like we've fixed the future, but our own damn military  is attacking us.  I'd say we should surrender, but there's no way we can let anyone get their hands on this thing.  Hold your position and try to secure any routes the enemy can use to bring in troops until we can leave.







Halfway there, Commander.  Just a little bit longer and we can come home.









The machine is almost ready ---!
