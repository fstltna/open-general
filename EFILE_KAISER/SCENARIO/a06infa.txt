07. OMSK (22 December 1918)

The autumn of 1918 brought good news to the Czech Legion. Austria-Hungary had surrendered and the new state of Czechoslovakia had declared its independance. In short, the Czechs and Slovaks of the Legion had a home to attend to. It would no longer be unneccasarily involve itself in the Russian Civil War anymore.

To reach its homeland, the Legion had still to cross Siberia, which was in control of White Russian power under Admiral Koltsjak. December 1918 saw a revolt against Koltsjak in Omsk, east of the Ural mountains, where Koltsjak held court. The Czech Legion supported Koltsjak as he did not object to the presence the Czech Legion - both sides had profit from one another. 

A small part of the Legion will take part in the action to put down this revolt. Support will come from Cossacks which are grazing in the countryside.
