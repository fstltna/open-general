Howdy!                                                                  01 August 2009

2009 Update: changed the starting HQ unit (you can now upgrade the HQ units via the new HQ class in version 2009.5 of the KG efile). 
Only battle edited was the 1st one (Spain). 

----
Here's my new KAmpfgruppe Efile version (2008) of my AXIS CAMPAIGN.  
It takes advantage of all of the additional capabilities of the PG2UK210.exe game engine.
  
> Experienced new units.
> Sound and smack file assignment (all SSI)
> Prototype assignment period.
> Combat support for HQ units
> Fire Support for AT Class
> and much more - too many to list.

The purpose of making this campaign is to enable the experience of being an Axis commander
supporting the war effort either through supporting a big German offensive or conducting
a smaller offense with only your Axis corps.  To truly get the 'Axis General' experience,
I have not enabled you to obtain German units.  Thus you can get whatever the Axis minor
countries can produce or get of German equipment, (Like the Romanian Stug IIIG) but no German
units!

This version v2008 (June 2008) - uses my new Kampfgruppe Equipment File other updates include:

  1. Reduced prestige cap levels - makes the campaign a little tougher - getting a BV will truly be brilliant!
  
  2. Lots of new units from my efile - see the Sapper's Kampfgruppe Efile readme file for details

  3. Adjusted scenarios to accomidate the new equipment file and to also take advantage of comments from guys that
  played the FFWC version.  Most notably the victory hexes were modified to improve the AI play.

  4. Changed the campaign flow slightly, in the first few battles - to improve game flow.

  5. A complete removation of all the units - to maiximize the capabilities of the Kampgruppe efile.  This creates 
  an entirely new feel, not just from the new efile, but from re-arranged units that makes sense when accounting 
  for AT units that give support fire and in that some Artillery do not give support fire now.

  6. A few modifications based on play comments from the PG2 dudes at JP's Panzers.  Thanks guys.

  7. The new KG Efile v2008 now has HQ-Cmd units (non-purchaseable) that provide Cbtr Spt as an inherent function.
  You get one to represent your Division (Then Corps?) HQ throughout the Campaign.


The version-9 ( November 2005 ) update also:

  1. Used some new ideas to improve scenarios playability and enhance the computer's AI
  to give you a good battle.

  2. Re-arranged the scenario battle flow to decrease the early war battles by 2 - this was a little 
  tedious from the inability to buy better stuff during build phases and also gave the core troops too
  much experience for mid war battles.

  3. Fine tuned the prestige cap and prestige awards a little more.  This to make build phases more fun....
  ....but you must manage your prestige or you'll run into trouble later.


The April 2005 release-Face lift did a few things:

  I - two new battles, Albania 1940 and Voroshilovgrod 1943
  
  II - Masive prestige awards shift on both directions - to better match war time realities of doing upgrades and
  the time it takes to perform this - this has the side effect of making things a wee bit harder.

  III - Checked all units - some upgrades for the FFWC 2004 efile update and some more 'spinkling' of
  leaders for the computer player to throw at you.

  IV - Did a difficulty review and made some of the earlier battles a little easier and the later battle harder.  
  I did this review based on JP's Campaign reviews forum feedback - thanks to all that provided this feedback.
