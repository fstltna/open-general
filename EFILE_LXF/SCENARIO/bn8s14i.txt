THE STORY

Main battle begun by frontal assault of the 26th Division backed by artillery and armor against German 891st and 892nd Regiments but failed to breach it.

On 28 November Army Group E allowed 15th Mountain Corps to begun retreat from Knin to more defensible position north Knin which were to be held during the winter. Two days later Germans begun shortening their front by pulling back from Ostra Glavica, Bulajusi and Lisnik, also fresh 847th Regiment from 392nd Division arrived in area of Padene to boost German defenses in that sector.

On 1 December new assault breaks Germans lines, successful morthen outflanking maneuver by 8th Brigade of the 20th Division attacks German forces in Padene area while 26th Division ties down most of Germans to the southern sector. Next day 14th Brigade of the 19th Division reaches Knin - Padene road and connects with 20th Division completing encirclement of German forces in Knin. 1st Dalmatian Brigade breaches German lines in the south advances towards Knin itself.

Between 2 and 3am on 3 December, 1st and 12 Dalmatian brigade arrived into Knin across demolished brigade over Krka river and by 4am linked up with 9th Brigade of the 20th Division liberating Knin. Most of German forces were cut off in several pockets, smaller one southeast of Knin was eliminated by 26th Division capturing 1200 German soldiers. Most of 264th Division was surrounded near Stara Straza with only small group lead by division commander Alois Windisch managed to breakthrough during the night of 3/4 November. As a last act of desperation to prevent it from falling into Partisan hands Germans set fire to their ammunition and fuel depot stored in Stara Straza railway tunnel killing around 600 of their wounded which were also located inside.

By 4 December most organized resistance ceased with Germans attempting to reach their lines in small groups, amongst captured was Konrad Wild, commander of the 383rd Regiment of the 373rd Division.
