You have been attached as the second wave of Operation Husky, our amphibious assault on Sicily.  We have succeeded in landing the first wave at Gela and Licata and the 82nd Airborne has captured the Airfield North of Gela. Heavy counterattacks are expected in the near future, so get your men ashore as soon as possible.
