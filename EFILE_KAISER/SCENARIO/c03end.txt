Comrade! Kiev is liberated!  Imagine the headline of tomorrow's newspaper!  "The Ukrainian capital has been liberated!"   The people of the Ukraine are now free from the capitalists who have ruled them for the past few weeks.

Also, I assume you know what to do with the Ukrainian prisoners of war?  They are traitors of their own people.  They allied themselves with the very power that invaded their country and they deserve nothing but the final penalty.
