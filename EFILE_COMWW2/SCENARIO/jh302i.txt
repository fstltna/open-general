Brest-Litovsk
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
General, welcome to the East. Let me brief you. The government in Berlin has finally decided that it is time to destroy our sworn enemies - the Bolsheviks. Your attack here at Brest-Litowsk will be the opening hour of Operation Barbarossa. Along a front line 3000km long, guns will open fire. The enemy should be completely surprised and you'll be able to cross the Bug river with almost no resistance. Good luck all the same!
