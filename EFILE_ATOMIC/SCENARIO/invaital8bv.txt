Well done commander! 

Tensions arose between the Vatican and the Allies after the bombing and destroction of the Abbazia di Montecassino. There is no evidence that the bombs dropped on the Monte Cassino monastery that day killed any German troops. Only after the destruction of the Abbey, German Paratroopers began to use the abbey as a strongpoint and observation post. Following the war, the abbey was rebuild in the 1950s.
