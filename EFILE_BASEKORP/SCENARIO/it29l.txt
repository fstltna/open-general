PORT SAID May 1943 L

Your failure to capture Alexandria means that we lose the initiative in North Africa. No help can be expected from the Germans. They are preparing for a major Russian Summer offensive at Kursk. You are dismissed.  

News: 
- Our Japanese Allies lose most of the forces that were to finish the conquest of New Guinea at the battle of the Bismarck sea when their transports were sunk by US and RAAF bombers.
- Radio Berlin announces the discovery by Wehrmacht of mass graves of Poles killed by Soviets in the Katyn massacre.
