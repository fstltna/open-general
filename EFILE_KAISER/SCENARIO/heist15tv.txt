Kindralmajor,

Congratulations on your victory over the forces of General Von der Goltz.  It was a hard-won battle, but it will remain a symbol.

The German troops have broken through the Latvians' southern flank and are retreating toward Riga.  You must knock them out of the town at all costs.
