MILLERBLITZ+ CHOICE SCENARIO

"General, you have been given the choice of command"

You, the player, can determine which campaign you want to play by moving your unit either south to Gibraltar or southeast towards Tobruk. If you want to play the classical Blitzkrieg! scenario path you should choose Tobruk. If you want to play the campaign called Greater Europe (also originally by H. Craig Miller) you should capture Gibraltar.
PLEASE NOTE: Go directly to your choice, otherwise you will be sent back to this scenario!
