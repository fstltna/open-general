Welcome to East Africa, commander.  I am Captain Jenkins and I shall be your assistant for the foreseeable future - unless I'm killed, captured or sent on a special mission to Fiji....

As I'm sure you're well aware, the Italians have decided to join the war on the German side.  That was a month ago.  The Italian forces here in East Africa have been fairly docile, as they percieve themselves to be in a relatively weak position.  However, it appears now that Mussolini's gaze has fixed itself to British Somaliland.  Italian forces have advanced into the territory, on three lines of advance.  A western column is advancing towards the coast at Zeila; a central column is advancing along the main road to Berbera; and an eastern column is protecting the central column's flank.  It has been decided, in light of our limited resources, to concentrate our forces in the centre, and you have thus been given the task of defending the main road into Berbera.  To accompolish this, your men will occupy a series of hills overlooking this road.  You are to hold the enemy up for as long as possible.

Good luck, sir.
