Operation Typhoon - Borodino October1941

The SS-Division "Reich" and parts of the 10th Panzer Division were approaching the Borodino battlefield 100 km west of Moscow. Between them and the Russian Capital stood the reinforced 32nd Siberian Rifle Division, just arrived by train to man the partly completed Mozhaisk Defense Line. After five days of brutal fighting, the SS finally got through, but fresh units filled in behind the survivors.
