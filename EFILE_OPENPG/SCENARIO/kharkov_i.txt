It is imperative that we regain the initiative by launching a counterattack to retake Kharkov, a city recently taken by advancing Soviet armies. If you are able to retake Kharkov and all other objectives by March 14th, we should be in a position to launch a major offensive aimed at Kursk in the summer. An early victory at Kharkov will make it easier for us to overwhelm the Soviets when the weather turns warm again.
