Battle of Sakarya - August 23rd, 1921

The Greek army began its final offensive on July 16, 1921, overcoming our defenses and taking Eski Shehir on the 17th. Our troops retreated with heavy losses to a defence line behind the Sakarya River, just 50 miles from our capital, Ankara.

Our position is strong, entrenched in hills behind the river. The Greek army had to decide between digging in and defending the gains, or advancing towards Ankara in order to destroy it, thus extending its lines of communication and supply in a hostile territory. After much deliberation they chose to attack.

You must stop the Greek offensive; their forces are more organized and trained, but remember that your position is strong.

Orders:
You must control 6 VH for a BV, 5 for a V or 4 for a TV at the end of the scenario.
