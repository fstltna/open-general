Kornilov's death has been a terrible blow for us. Without his leadership many veteran warriors look lost now, like orphaned children without their father. The morale of our army has sunk. Alekseyev and Denikin have taken command and, knowing that it will take some time for our troops to recover, they have ordered us back to the Don River region. 
Another great problem is that Alekseyev is very ill. He's been trying to hide it, but we know he's suffering from cancer and heart disease. I wonder how long he'll be able to endure the unhealthy conditions we're living in.

At least the Bolsheviks have taken many losses, so they won't pursue us. And in the north, since the Don Cossacks have risen against the Reds and the German Army is getting close to Rostov, the power of the communists has been severely weakened. They won't be able to bother us, so we'll rest for some weeks and start a new offensive as soon as we can.
