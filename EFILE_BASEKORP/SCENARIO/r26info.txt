26. SOFIA (12 September 1944)

The last days, we have not encountered heavy resistance. Most of the Bulgarian Army is deployed in occupied territories in Greece and Yugoslavia. With the sign of our invasion, fascist leaders have ordered some loyal units to come back and defend the Bulgarian capital of Sofia against a Red invasion. The Red Army must help its comrades in Sofia who are supressed by fascists and take control of the city and its vicinity. Bulgarian proletarian partisans might help you during your advance. There are no signs of German fascists in the area, but watch our for some loyal crack Bulgarian fascists. Good luck, comrade.
