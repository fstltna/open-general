Strangers in a strange land

May 10th, 1900

Although initially the British were reluctant to employ non-white units in this war, now they're desperate. While you were fighting in Port Elizabeth an expeditionary corps was formed in India, and they disembarked in Durban some weeks ago. They tried to go to  Buller's aid in Colenso, but due to their lack of knowledge of the terrain and their defective maps they didn't arrive in time.

Now the Indian Corps is trying to go back to Durban, but we won't allow them to do so. They could be very dangerous fighting under the protection of trenches and forts, so you should take the opportunity to overcome them in the open. Attack them and destroy them while Botha, Smuts and De Wet outflank their lines and take Durban by surprise.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.
- Your MSU must survive.
