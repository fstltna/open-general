03. TSJELJABINSK (14 May 1918)

An agreement has been made between the Bolshevik authorities in Moscow and the Czech Legion. The Legion is allowed to get out of Russia using the Trans-Siberian railway. So the Legion was scattered over the railway between Penza and the Urals in May 1918. 

It was not of the Legion's wishes to mix itself into any Russian internal affairs but local Soviet authorities were sometimes acting on their own good. The relation between the Soviets and Czechs was tense. So on 14 May 1918 the units of the Legion arrived in Tsjeljabinsk, east of the Ural mountains, where a train with Hungarian prisoners of war which were returning to Austria-Hungary in accordance with the Brest-Litovsk treaty. At Tsjeljabinsk an incident between a number of Czechs and Hungarians took place after which the local Soviet authority imprisoned a number of Czechs. Trotsky ordered to disarm the Legion which was sufficient for the Legion's commanders to take their faith into their own hands. 

You have to attack the prisonhouse in Tsjeljabinsk and free your fellow legionairs. You might have to defend yourself against possible attacking local Soviet troops and the Hungarian POWs which are still in the vicinity. Parts of the Legion is still at railroads west of Tsjejabinsk but some of them might arrive on time to help you.

NOTE: YOU CAN USE THE RAILROADS BY EMBARKING YOUR UNITS FROM NOW ON.
