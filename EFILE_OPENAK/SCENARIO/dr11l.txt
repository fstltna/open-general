Kiev encirclement - Konotop September1941 L

We missed the chance to trap 600,000 Bolsjeviks in what would have been the Kiev pocket. Send your troops back North for the final assault on Moscow. And don't give me any excuses, I know the raspoetitsa - the dreaded Fall rains - have set in. This will disrupt mobility but we do need to reach Moscow before the winter.
