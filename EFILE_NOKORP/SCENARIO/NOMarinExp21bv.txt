Good work. Great tactical victory, the city of Quebec and its port is ours.
Unfortunately not a strategic victory: The Canadians have regrouped around Montreal, and I guess they will do that city after city till we reach the Pacific coast - With the constant risk of US troops falling on our backs.
It will be a long war.
