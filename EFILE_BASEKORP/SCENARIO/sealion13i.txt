Historical Info:

On 9th April 1940 Germany launched a invasion of both, Denmark and Norway. Denmark had to surrender quickly, but Norway, with the help of British, French and Polish troops, was able to fight the Germans untill the Allies had to retreat and Norway capitulated to the Germans on 10th June 1940.

The Germans took Narvik quickly but later lost 10 destroyers (50% of their entire destroyer force) and were pushed eastwards by the allied forces. The Germans even had to consider reatreating into neutral Sweden and getting interned. However, the situation at the western front in France forced the Allies to retreat. On 8 June, General Dietl retook Narvik, and on 10 June the last Norwegian forces in Norway surrendered.
