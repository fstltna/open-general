Advance on Jerusalem, 19th November 1917
-------------------------------------------------------------------
After the fall of Gaza, the EEF advanced along the Maritime Plain and then performed a right turn into the Judean Hills in order to march on Jerusalem.

We just have taken city of Latron and are now entering the Judean Hills which block our approach to the Holy City. Given the importance of Jerusalem heavy Turkish resistance is to be expected.
