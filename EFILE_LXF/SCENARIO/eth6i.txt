SECOND BATTLE OF TEMBIEN

February 27th, 1936 (Tigray Province, Northern Ethiopia)

On the morning Ras Mulugueta died, Badoglio launched his second attack in the Tembien. Rumors of the great battle at Amba Aradam had already spread, and were confirmed, first by Dejaz Aberra Kassa (son of Ras Kassa) who had headed for the Tembien and then by Italian leaflets dropped from the air.

The Bitwoded Makonnen's death was more of a blow to the morale of the Ethiopians than the death of Ras Mulugueta, unpopular with all for his severity.  It was a demoralized and much reduced army that the Italians had to attack. There were 50,000 armed men or less facing the Italians instead of the 150,000 that had attacked them a month or so before. It was always difficult to keep any large Ethiopian army in the field.

Ras Kassa knew that an Italian attack was imminent and that a large force of Italians was moving down the Gheva valley TO CUT HIM OFF FROM THE REAR. But his was a strong defensive position; the mountains were almost impregnable. Ras kassa waited almost with confidence for the Italians to break themselves on the lower slopes of the mountains, as they had done before.

What Ras Kassa had failed to allow for was Italian mountaineering skill. To climb the sheer cliffs of the Golden Mountain, Worq Amba, would have been an exploit even by daylight. To climb it by night and when it was occupied by the enemy was a heroic feat.
