The First World War - The Gallipoli Landings - April 1915 - LOSS

Général, your conduct of this battle has been appaling, and only your good reputation and the fact that the British performance has been even worse has saved you from being relieved from your command. We can call ourselves lucky that the Turks are equally exhausted, otherwise they would haven driven us into the sea. We had to call off the offensive, before we could even reach Krithia. Now we have to dig in and hold our position for the time being.

HISTORICAL EVENTS:

After the costly setbacks during the initial landings, the allied advance on Krithia was stopped by the Turks on April 28th, and in some places the British and French were even driven back to their starting positions. Another 3,000 allied troops lost their lives on a devastating day that left the infantry men exhausted, demoralized and virtually leaderless due to an appaling breakdown of command. The high hopes for a swift and crushing victory at Gallipoli vanished and the whole campaign turned into trench warfare.
