Modder River

November 28th, 1899

After driving the Boer off Belmont and Graspan we followed our advance north along the Western Cape Railway, in order to relieve Kimberley.
The next natural obstacle that we found was the confluence of the Modder and Riet rivers, where the Boer had blown the railway. Although our explorers did not find any sign of enemy presence, we approached cautiously to avoid a possible ambush. The Traansvalers and Free Staters, led by Cronjé and de la Rey, couldn't be very far away.
