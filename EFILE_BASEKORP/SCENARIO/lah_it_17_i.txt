We have been ordered back to the Eastern Front for an offensive at Lake Balaton, Hungary.  The operation aims at destroying the Red Army between the Danube, the Plattensee and the Drava, and establishing a line east of the Balaton oil fields.  Our first objective is Sumontomya.

The conditions out there are very difficult, an early thaw has left the ground water-logged making it impossible for our vehicles to operate off-road.
