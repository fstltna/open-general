Last days in Novorossiysk

Mar 12th, 1920

My defence of Kharkov could have given us a chance to recover, but France and the United Kingdom simply betrayed us. They've stopped their support to our cause and are preparing themselves to live in a world with communist governments. In the other fronts the news are equally bad. Kolchak and Yudenich have been defeated, so now the Bolsheviks can send all of their units against us. Believing that our end is imminent, many of our soldiers have deserted.
The Bolsheviks have taken advantage from all of this, and in these past months they've driven us out from most of Ukraine, the Don region, and the Kuban. Even Ekaterinodar fell some days ago. At least thay've been forced to pay a very heavy price, with tens of thousands of dead and wounded.
Now all of our past mistakes are more evident. And not only the military ones, the political ones too. We refused to make a deal with the Polish and Ukrainian independentists, and thus we lost some potential allies who could have been decisive. Denikin tried to develop a serious agrarian reform, but we didn't listen to him. We were very busy with the military issues, and thus we lost the support of the peasants. The Bolsheviks only offer them false promises, but even that is better than the lootings and harsh treatment that they've received from us. Soon they'll learn that the Reds are even worse masters, but for now they dream of their arrival.

Our last bastion remains in Crimea. Denikin has decided to evacuate as many people as possible there, in order to make a last stand. We've got enough ships, so the evacuation isn't a problem, but someone will have to defend the mountain passes, fighting the Bolsheviks and giving the others enough time to travel safely to Crimea. And that's what Denikin has ordered me to do.

Victory conditions: 
- Destroy 45 enemy units.
- Don't lose any of your 6 MSUs. You can embark them, if you wish.
