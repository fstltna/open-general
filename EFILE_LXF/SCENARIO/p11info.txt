11. TORINO (28 April 1945)

The spring offensive has been a huge success. Both the US 5th and British 8th Army are rolling into the Po Valley with the Axis troops no hope of stopping us! Most divisions will head for the Alps near Austria to cut off any German retreat towards the area. US IV Corps will conquer the western Po Valley with the key cities of Milan, Genoa and Torino. Milan and Genoa have recently been captured. Lighting advances are being made towards Torino. The PEF is part of US IV Corps.

The axis are retreating with no goal. West of Torino, the French Alps begin where the French 27th Mountain Division is making attacks. The PEF and the US 92nd Infantry Division are pushing from the east and south-east. All over the countryside Italian partisans are making life for any enemy a hell. However still fractions of German and RSI Italian divisions are resisting. They must be forced to surrender. You have orders to capture all important areas in the vicinity of Torino.

The war is close to its end. Berlin is being captured while most of Germany is already taken. There are cease-fire talks concerning the German troops in Italy. In a few days the war will be over!
