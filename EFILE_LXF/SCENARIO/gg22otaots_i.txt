Herr General,

Due to the adverse weather conditions and supply problems, OKH has re-evaluated your drive on Moscow to more modest objectives for now.

II Panzer Army Battleplan:

1. Hold the southern side of Tula and take the northern side of the city.

2. Hold the airfield north of Tula.

3. Hold objectives north-east of Tula and capture Kryukovo and the airfield north of Luznka. 

Player Note: As the commander of a large number of troops and equipment you have decided the orders from OKH are unachievable without excessive losses to your Panzer Army so a withdrawal to more defendable positions is required!! You must successfully retreat your HQ unit to the escape hex to win. You should own at least one VH till the successful escape.

Recomended purchase: - Replace losses,upgrades and overstrengthening.

Suggested Core: - 5x Tank, 1x Anti-Tank, 6x Infantry, 2x Recon, 3x Artillery, 1x Air Defence, 1x Fighter, 1x Tac Bomber (Including Protos).

Max Core: - 21x Ground Units.

Good luck.
