Vienna - April 1945 BV

Your forces have repelled the attack on Vienna and have struck a severe blow to the enemy. The Russians - tired of the war and unable to cope with long supply lines - have gotten in comparable difficulties on other fronts. This situation is forcing Stalin to negotiate a peace settlement. This will bring peace to Europe and will save our country. You performed wonderfully General.

HISTORY
Vienna fell to the Russians. The Der Fuehrer regiment was sent to Prague for a (successful) rescue mission of the entrapped garrison forces, the Deutschland regiment clashed with American forces near St Poelten Austria and the rest of the division was sent to Dresden.
