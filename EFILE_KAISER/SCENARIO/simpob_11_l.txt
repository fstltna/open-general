Without the cossacks, I would have suffered an embarrasing defeat at Samara. Thank God that they came to our rescue. In the end, Simbirsk, Samara and Syzran were taken. 

Ninety miles. That was all the distance between our divisions and Denikin's army. With minimal effort, our forces could have joined before the end of August.

But at that time the Anti-Bolshevik resistance lacked an unified command, and our plans weren't always properly coordinated. Denikin believed that he had a good opportunity to take Moscow, so he ordered most of his units to leave the Volga region, go to the north and take Kursk and Orel. His reserve went even further, to Ukraine, to protect his left flank from the attacks of Makhno's anarchists. As usual, we were on our own.

It was frustrating, and Kolchak was furious, but there was nothing that we could do. Denikin had refused to acknowledge Kolchak as the supreme leader of the anti-Bolsheviks, and he didn't accept his orders.

Sadly, we had even bigger problems. In the north, our Siberian Army had liberated Glazov, but it seemed unable to follow its advance and take Vyatka. And the partisans had become a real problem They attacked the railroads everywhere, so our supply lines were in danger. In fact, we had to cancel our plans for new operations, and my men had to spend the rest of the summer pursuing bands of partisans between Samara and Belebei. Wasting more than two months in minor operations was disheartening. It meant that the war would last until the next winter, at the very least.
