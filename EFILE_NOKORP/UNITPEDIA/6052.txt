The "Entwicklung" series of tanks was an attempt to standardize tank construction, and make simpler, more reliable and cheaper tanks.The E-series designs were simpler, cheaper to produce and yet more efficient than their predecessors.

E-75 was intended to be the standard heavy tank, to be used as a replacement of the Tiger II and the Jagdtiger.
