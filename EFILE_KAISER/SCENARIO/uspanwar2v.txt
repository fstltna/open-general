Congratulations!

You have accomplished your mission brilliantly and we can now start pushing Maceo's troops out of Western Cuba.

In view of your outstanding service you have been selected for promotion to "Teniente Coronel".

General Lachambre, who has been assigned to combat the new insurgency in the Philippines, has asked you to go with him. Good luck! 

Historical background:

The results of the battle differ considerably depending on the protagonists. For the Spanish, it was a victory that "deserved a place in the best pages of Spanish history" since despite fighting superior forces they have dislodged Cubans from their positions and were able to beat the enemy again on their return.

According to Cuban and American sources, the Spanish met with a terrible defeat since they were not able to hold the ground and suffered serious losses. In addition, apparently Maceo was not there.

What is true is that a second column under General Bernal coming from Aguacate should have joined Inclan's forces in his attack to Cacarajicara. Bernal's column failed to support General Inclan in the time specified. As a result, and also due to personal enmity, General Bernal was driven out of Cuba by Weyler.

After Cacarajicara, Weyler began an aggressive campaign to put an end to Maceo's invasion of Western Cuba and force his troops back across the "trocha" (fortified line) and into Eastern provinces. After some months of harsh combats, Maceo became convinced that he would have to leave Pinar del Río province behind and return to the East, where the insurrection had also fallen on hard times. When he was going to meet Cuban Chief Commander Máximo Gómez to plan the ulterior course of war, on December 7 he was killed in a skirmish with a Spanish column.
