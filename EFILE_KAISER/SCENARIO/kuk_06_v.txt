We must stop. While you were crushing the Italian divisions in the mountains, the Russians launched a counterattack in the east. Our units were taken by surprise, and now all the Eastern Front could collapse. We must send all our reserves there as soon as we can, or all could be lost in a matter of days. We can't continue our offensive here.

We were so close this time...Now we'll have to go on the defensive again, waiting for the reaction of the Italians, and hoping that we'll be able to stop them just as we've done up to now. At least now we control some strategical positions, and they can be useful in the future, if we ever have another chance to strike our enemies.
