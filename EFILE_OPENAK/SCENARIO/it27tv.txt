FAID PASS February 1943 TV

Congratulations. You have captured Faid pass and secured Sened and Maknassy. This gives us solid defensive positions in Central Tunisia and a base for big follow-up attacks on Sbeitla and Kasserine towards Tebessa and maybe even Bone, splitting or even surrounding large Allied forces in Tunisia and Algeria.

But our next concern is 8th Army, which stands in front of the Mareth line in Southern Tunisia. If 8th Army brakes through there is a risk that they make contact with Allied troops in Northern and Central Tunisia. That would be the beginning of the end of our presence in Africa.
