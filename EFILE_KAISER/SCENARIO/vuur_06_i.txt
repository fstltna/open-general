At this moment only a miracle could save our republics. The British outnumber us nearly four to one. Bloemfontein and Johannesburg have fallen, and six days ago so did Pretoria. 
The Kakies think that we'll surrender in a matter of weeks, but obviously they don't know us at all. We've gathered the remmants of our army in the hills east of Pretoria and we're preparing a last line of defence there. Our enemies may win this war by the force of numbers, but they'll never break our spirits. 14,000 enemy soldiers will assault our positions very soon. Show them what we're made of! But beware of the British cavalry, they'll try to outflank you and attack from your rear.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.
- Your MSU core unit must survive.

Special notes:
- Purchasing is disabled in this scenario.
- In the next scenario you'll lose your core.
