The Campaign...
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
You take command from the civil war in Spain, to the "lightning" victories of early World War II - and beyond! 
This campaign will test your abilities as a leader in both Blitzkrieg scenarios and defensive scenarios.
If you are skillful, you will fight in Afrika, Russia, and even England!

This campaign is a further development of MillerBlitz+ and Blitz 2008 which both of them were modernized versions of H. Craig Miller's Blitzkrieg!. This version has been modernized even further and contains major changes to the scenario set-up. There are some new scenarios and in consequence some of the old ones have disappeared.

Important message! 
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Please also note that this campaign is an Open General ONLY campaign, meaning that you can't use the old PG2 executable.
