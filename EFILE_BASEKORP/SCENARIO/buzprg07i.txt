Through the High Tatra

Bonus scenario.

*****

Battle of Dukla wasn't the only operation in which the 1st Czechoslovak Army Corps took part. While the most of the men fought in the Pass, the 2nd Paradesant Brigade was paradropped on a Slovak ground to help the insurgents. But the Uprising was suppressed, and the insurgents seeked refugee in the mountains, with many of them trying to cross the front.

The Slovak National uprising is highly controversial theme and everything surrounding it became a reason for heated discussions in past years. As such, I didn't want to dabble in it. But I couldn't gloss over it just as well. So, this lead me to the creation of something special.

Take the upcoming mission as a chance how to take a rest from the grandiose scenarios so far...

Intelligence and reconnaisance: While on its way through the mountains, our ad hoc group of soldiers and insurgents lead by some parachutists of the 2nd brigade realized that an enemy column moves on the same mountain trail. This is a perfect chance to set a trap. These Germans are part of the infamous anti-partisan forces, a cause of many misery in surrounding villages. Now they will pay for their cruelty...

Reinforces: None.

Hint: Hold a compact formation, isolated men will be an easy target to pick. Germans seem to not know of your presence and they march southwards from the hamlet without much caution. If you could deal them a strong enough blow, they'll run away before they realize how small your forces are.

Note: This one scenario uses a scale of "unit = company".

Victory conditions: Destroy four enemy units. 

Warning: To say that "this scenario uses very limited deployment, use the 'View the Strategic Map' feature first!" would be an exagerration... You can't deploy anyone. :-))
