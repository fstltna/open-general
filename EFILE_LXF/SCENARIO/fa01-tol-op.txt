Good morning Kapteeni, 
for days now the Soviets have been bombing our seaports. The latest report shows a bomber formation aiming for Kotka.  
Situation report: You're ordered to take over command in the Kotka area and intercept all enemy aircraft.
Enemy: Reports show parts of three bomber regiments and two fighter regiments.
Our forces: All the defensive forces at Kotka including five fighter groups. We will also provide you the resources to raise your own fighter wing.

Show no mercy!  Stop the bombing of our cities.
