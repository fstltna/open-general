[Message from Burgos]

S.E. el Generalisimo wants to thank you for your quick and decisive defeat of the Republican resistance at Catalonia.  You have been awarded the army's highest decoration.

Some members of the government expect to end the war in the next month and maybe we will have a new Crusade in the future.
