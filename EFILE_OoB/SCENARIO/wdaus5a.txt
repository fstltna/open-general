Situation report: The Japanese have overwhelmed the Allied Forces throughout the Pacific. Their thrust into Malaya has caught the British completely by surprise. Prior to the war, it was thought impossible to operate tanks in the jungles of asia. The Japanese are not only using tanks, but using them in great numbers. Our only hope is to counter the Japanese threat with armour of our own.

Operational orders: Despite the short notice, your troops must be thrust right back into the thick of the action. As the only experienced armoured forces we have available, you must proceeed to Malaya and put your Tanks to good use. Your first operational area will be around the Port of Penang. Like Dunkirk, a large portion of our Allied Armies are faced with the prospect of anihilation unless the enemy is stopped. It is your task to hold the enemy from the port of Penang.
