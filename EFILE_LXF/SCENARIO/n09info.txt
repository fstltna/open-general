HOENGSONG (11 February 1951)

Indeed, Comrade General.  It is clear that the imperialists have never heard of Sun Tzu.  Since we are very vulnerable; we should avoid getting involved in their offensive and retreat some miles to a strong defensive position.   Now we are better prepared to go on the offensive again and continue our push south!

This night, in cooperation with our Chinese allies, we have resumed our offensive south.  It is restricted to the central sector near Hoengsong.  Our Chinese comrades have broken through the South Korean positions with their usual infiltrating tactics into enemy lines. Hoengsong itself is likely to be reinforced by the imperialists with their guns made by enslaved comrades in America.  While the Chinese attack from the west and north, you will attack from the east.  Show the communist strength by liberating Hoengsong and destroy any enemy you may find!
