3rd Ypres Prelude - Messines Ridge - June, 1917 - V

Good job General. Messines Ridge is back in our hands. 

Historical events:
The effect of the mines on the German defenders was devastating. Some 10,000 men were killed during the explosions alone. The British divisions took all objectives within three hours. German counterattacks were repelled. For the first time on the Western front, defensive casualties (25,000) exceeded attacking losses (17,000).
