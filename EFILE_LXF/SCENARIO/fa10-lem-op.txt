01/15/1940   Struggle For Lemetti

A new task awaits you.
The Soviets have much better commanders in this sector and up until now we haven't been able to encircle their units.  
Situation report: The enemy is advancing slow but steadily towards Kitilae and Lemetti. You need a strong counterstrike to stop their advance so we can launch a counterattack.
Enemy: We know about the 168th and 18th Rifle divisions. There are rumors about a Tank division which would be a major concern.
Our forces: Parts of your group are still on their way to this area and to date only a few units have arrived. You're also in command of the 12th and 13th Divisions which are already on the spot.

Hurry up and establish some starting points for the upcoming offensive. Watch your flanks!
Note: We don't have any airfields at this sector.
