Domokos - May 17th, 1897

After Velestino, the Greeks retreated to the mountains located south of Pharsala, near the village of Domokos. The position was easy to defend, and was the first of several mountain passes that the Turks would have to take on their way to Athens. The Greeks hoped to resist long enough, until the mediation of the Great Powers forced the Ottoman Empire to accept an armistice.
