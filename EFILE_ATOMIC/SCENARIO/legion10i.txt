SITUATION:

Comandante, most of the Mediterranean Sea is under our control. The British have only few isolated bases in the east. Your next mission will be a raid on Alexandria. Our human torpedos of Decima Flottiglia MAS will attack and sink the powerful enemy battleships that are anchored in the ports of Alexandria in an heroic attack that will cause havoc amongst the British units. Your men then will make landfall and destroy enemy facilities and capture important objectives.

ORDERS: 

Take all VHs in 12/16/20 turns for a BV/V/TV.

NOTES:

You can buy up to 4 new units in this scenario.

You start without an own airfield and have to build one once your sappers have landed.
