Battle of Kasserine Pass

February 16th, 1943

Anglo-American forces have disembarked in French territory, moving at full speed toward Tunisia. After your recent victory in Alexandria, we cannot affort a counterattack from behind. Due to your inexperienced rivals, their positions are very weak, but they are greater in number and better supplied.
Your mission:- Advance at full speed and take Tebessa.

Note: In Tebessa the Allies have a great oil reserve, that if you capture, will allow you to perform future offensive operations.
