Unfortunately two of the main generals of the Russian Army didn't even consider surrender. Annoying barbarians!
Fortunately, thanks to the secret documents your men have retrieved during your raid, we know where their troops are hiding, and you will have the honor of crushing them once and for all.

Strike fast and hard, for they will throw everything they have into the battle, and we had ample opportunity to establish that their production lines aren't affected by the fall of Moscow, quite the contrary. Don't let them swamp you in sheer numbers.



Instructions: Capture all VHs.
