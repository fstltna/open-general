First Ypres - La Bassee - October 10th 1914

Our new Chief of the General Staff, Colonel-General Erich von Falkenhayn, has decided that the war can be won in Flanders. He has made a plan consisting of three operations to achieve victory:
1. A major assault towards Arras with three infantry corps.
2. A cavalry sweep accross Flanders towards the coast with 8 divisions.
3. The capture of the now besieged city of Antwerp.

Calais on the coast - not Paris - has now become the glittering prize that can win the war on the Western Front.

Your 4th Kavallerie Division is part of HKK I on the South flank of the cavalry sweep that is to break through the enemy lines at La Bassee. [XVIII] from 4A, [XXI] from 6A and [XV] from 7A have given up their cavalry units to beef up the strength of your division.

The 1st Bavarian Reserve Infantry Division will arrive piecemeal over the next two days (during the first half of the scenario) in the sector of the Garde Kavallerie Division.
