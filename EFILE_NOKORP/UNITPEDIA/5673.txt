The Skoda "305 mm Mörser M.11" was a siege howitzer produced by Skoda Works and used by the Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I, and by the German Wehrmacht in World War II.
Due to its frequent use in conjunction with the 420 mm "Dicke Bertha" ("Fat Bertha"), this mortar was eventually nicknamed "Schlanke Emma" ("Thin Emma"). The lighter, mountain version was nicknamed "Gretel".
