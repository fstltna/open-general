00. FALCIU 1 (22 June 1941)

Dear Comrade. Today fascist forces from Germany have attacked our borders, from the Baltic to the Ukraine. To make things worse, Rumania has declared war upon us. The situation looks grim but we are prepared. Our Red Army is the biggest army in the world and we have more tanks and aircraft than any other country. Victory will be ours.

Your unit is part of the 150th Rifle Division located in Bessarabia, former part of Rumania. It is likely that the Rumanians will start an offensive here soon. To prevent this and conquer suitable defensive positions to start our own offensive from, you must cross the Prut River at Falciu, capture the bridge and form a bridgehead. Reinforcements will be brought in whenever possible. Beware of the Rumanians who will fight feriously because it is their own soil they will be fighting on. You must succeed. Good luck, Comrade!

NOTE: You do not start with core units. You have to buy them.
