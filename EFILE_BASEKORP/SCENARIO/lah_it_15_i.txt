We have finally been given the order to move to the Normandy region, Caen to be exact.  The Hitlerjugend division need our support in defending the important city against the British attacks.  They are taking heavy casualties holding on to the high ground to the west of the city - in the face of British armour and infantry assaults.  We will be taking over the defence of the Caen region, and hope to launch a counter-attack soon.
