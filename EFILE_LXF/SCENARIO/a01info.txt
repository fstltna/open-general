01. SALZACH VALLEY 1 (16 March 1938)

The front at Linz and the Traun Line has been stabilized for now. German forces must regroup before being able to successfully resume their offensive. However south of Linz, around Salzburg and the Salzach River Valley, the Germans seem to have chosen to penetrate into Austria. If they are not stopped, our forces at Linz and the Traun Line will be in danger of being attacked in their flank. Even more, if we lose control of this area, the 6th Infantry Division in Tirol will be cut off. 

At Salzburg we have the 8th Infantry Brigade in line. However they will not be able to stop the onslaught of the several German divisions which are expected to storm our lines. Your force is being dispatched to support 8th Infantry. Elements of the Fast Division, part of the Reserve, are heading to Salzburg as well and will soon arrive. Air cover is not guaranteed but we will do our very best to support you!

The Germans already have crossed the border and taken Hallein. You must recapture Hallein and hold the front, if any important sites are lost, you have orders to recapture them.
