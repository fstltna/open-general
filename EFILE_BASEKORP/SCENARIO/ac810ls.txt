To the Italian troops in Greece.

Your hard won victory over the British was costly but yet finally complete.  Your General did not survive the RAF attacks, thankfully Marshall Graziani quickly turned the battle in our favor.

Let us rest while we reform our legions, bury our dead and prepare for our future campaigns.  I salute you for your tenacity under these very hard circumstances.
