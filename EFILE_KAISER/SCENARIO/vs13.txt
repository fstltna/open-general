Antwerp - The Second Exit - September 9th 1914

Four days ago we discovered that the French and the British are sending troops through a gap between our First and Second Armee at the Marne. [IXReserve] corps and your 6.Reserve Division were sent away from our positions in front of Antwerp to the Marne to plug the hole in our lines there.

The last few days, the seven division strong Belgian Army kept its positions around the Antwerp fortresses. We have 5.Reserve Division, the newly formed Marine Division, 37.Landwehr Brigade and 1.Reserve Ersatz Brigade keeping an eye on them.  

This morning however, the Belgian Army is exiting its positions and has launched a full scale attack in support of the operations at the Marne. Your 6.Reserve Division is called back and troops from 39. Division  - also on route to the Marne - will detrain close to Leuven to help push back the Belgian Army attack.

You will not be able to deploy your core ground troops (6.Reserve Division) until later in the scenario.
