During the month-long progress through Slovakia, the 1st Czechoslovak Army Corps liberated many great cities, but then they were stopped at Liptovsky Svaty Mikulas, where there were many casualties both on Czechoslovak and on Soviet side.

Although it is said that the catastrophe at Liptovsky Svaty Mikulas happened mainly due to the low morale of Soviet soldiers, who immediatelly pillaged the local distillery, it is hard to argue about the fact that Germans put up a heavy resistence.

On 5th April Ruzomberok was captured, and not a week later Turciansky Svaty Martin also fell into Czechoslovak hands.
