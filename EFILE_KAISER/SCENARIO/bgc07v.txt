Good work, General! Your troops overran the Turkish lines and stormed Scimitar Hill. Unfortunately, we have lost far too many men to carry on with the attack. Again, the final breakthrough has not been achieved.

HISTORICAL OUTCOME:
The preliminary bombardment for the attack on Scimitar Hill was very heavy for Gallipoli, but a mist on the Suvla plain favoured the enemy, interfering with the aim of the British gunners. 
While 87th Brigade of the 29th Division stormed the crest of Scimitar Hill and chased the Turks back towards the high ground leading to Kuchuk Anafarta, the 11th Division failed to take the "W Hills". 29th Division came under heavy fire from the intact field guns of "W Hills" and from Tekke Tepe. A storm of lead swept them from the crest of the Scimitar. To make things worse, a great fire broke out in the undergrowth, so little headway could be made. Another attempt to take Scimitar Hill by the 2nd Mounted Brigade which was thrown into battle, failed a few hours later.There was not an atom of gain, for everywhere the troops fell back to the original line.
The attack at Scimitar Hill cost the British 5,300 casualties and was the last attempt to advance at Suvla. The front line remained between Green Hill and Scimitar Hill for the remainder of the campaign until the evacuation.
