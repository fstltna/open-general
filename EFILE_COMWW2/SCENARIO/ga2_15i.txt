Herr General, Our situation in Hungary is rapidly becoming critical!: Operation Fruhlingserwachen has stalled, Soviet efforts at outflanking our advanced forces have intensified, and the latest intelligence indicates the Soviets are planning a massive counter-offensive! So, Herr General, in this situation, the only orders are: Use your best battlefield judgement! 

VICTORY CONDITIONS: 

You must retain control of Szekesfehervar long enough to allow 5 ground units to be moved into the Berhida Corridor when it opens up.
