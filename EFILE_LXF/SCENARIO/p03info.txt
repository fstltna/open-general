03. MOGADISHU (22 February 1941)

As we have joined the British against the Axis powers of Germany and Italy, we will assist them as much as we are capable of. One of the main British campaigns is the assault on the Italian colony of Ethiopia. From Sudan, a northern force will attack. From Kenya, a southern force will attack first Italian Somaliland, and next Ethiopia.

Your forces have been transported to our colony of Mozambique where you have finished additional training. You will now participate in the Allied attack against Ethiopia. Your PEF has been allocated to the southern attacking force in Kenya. You will wage war alongside Nigerian, Rodesian and South African soldiers. Belgium has offered a colonial detachment and we can count on local irregulars for assistance.

Your first goal will be the port of Mogadishu. If we are able to capture this port, our supplylines to Kenya will be drastically shortened and we can turn our direction of advance into Ethiopia. The Italians are expected to put up a small but ferious fight. We doubt they are willing or able to hold Mogadishu for long. Good luck, General.
