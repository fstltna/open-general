Conversion of an unfinished H-39 class battleship. Ficitious but possible.
The outbreak of WWII had halted work on the first two (of 6) H-39 battleships, until end 1941, when they were scrapped.
If Gemany had the resources, given that battleships had gone out of fashion in 1941/42, the hulls would had been converted to carriers.
