TACTICAL VICTORY

You have done well but the enemy was far stronger than expected. Enemy fire was very heavy and supplies could almost not make it to the troops. The order to evacuate has been given. Our operation against Porton has been a failure. We will simply hold the Buoi-Ruri line and guard it with active patrolling.
