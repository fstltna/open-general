04. DOWN'S HILL (19 February 1945)

Beyond the Genga River lies Down's Hill, rough high ground some miles inland. The Japanese have occupied this key feature and you must clear it from the enemy. Also Tsimba Ridge must fully be cleared from Japanese troops in order to secure our supplylines. The Japanese will fight with known stubborness. Good luck, General!
