The time for Operation Citadel has come. You are to attack and destroy the Soviet forces in the Kursk salient. The seizure of several key cities behind the front lines (including Kursk) is the key to this battle. You must capture all of your objectives by July 24th. We must warn you that we expect massive Russian counterattacks in your sector to begin within ten days. If you are unable to take all of your objectives, you must at a minimum hold two objectives.
