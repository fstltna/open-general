The attack on Moscow is in it's preparation stages. Your forces are being positioned around the city itself along with the majority of Allied forces.  However, an extremely desperate plan by the Soviets to produce deadly Sarin nerve gas and drop it into the city upon Allied troops during the final thrust has shown itself.  The situation has risen to crisis-level as the Soviets prepare to ship the Sarin gas into trucks from a large manufacturing facility north-east of Moscow itself.  Unfortunately, we don't have the time to manuever your forces to the crisis point, so you will have to use a highly trained force which has responded to the area.  Take the gas and prevent them from shipping it out.  You must hurry, so move quickly. Armored corps are on route. Good luck, Commander.
