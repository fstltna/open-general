15. ROSTOV 1943 (2 February 1943)

We have advanced hundreds of kilometers and we once again stand at the gates of Rostov. It is vital that we capture this gate to the Caucasus as soon as possible, because still not all German units have retreated over the Don, back into the Ukraine. Although many Germans are forced back to the Taman/Kuban peninsula, enemy mobile forces are rushing towards Rostov. If you are quick enough than you can trap them before they have crossed the Don River. In any case, it is vital that we do not lose the momentum in this winter offensive. We must push the fascists invaders back, back and back. Good luck, comrade!
