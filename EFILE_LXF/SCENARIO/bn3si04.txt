
BATTLE OF TAIERCHUANG
19 Mar 1938

Part of Battle of Hsuchow
Late December - Early June 1938

To destroy withdrawing KMT troops, the Japanese GHQ ordered a full speed pursuit in the North. Spearheading the attack on the escaping Chinese were the Japanese 5th Division and the 10th division. Those two divisions were the very best and most mobile of the Japanese. But the Chinese General Li Zong Ren set a trap for the Japanese in the city of Taierchuang. 
While the defenders of Taierchuang fought on and held the city against both the Japanese 5th and 10th Divisions, Li moved his strike forces from the south and attacked the Japanese from behind. The Battle of Taierchuang was one of few Chinese victories.
