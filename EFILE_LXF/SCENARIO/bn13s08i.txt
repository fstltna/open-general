
BREDA - 11 MAY 1940

After months of sitting idle, the German Army has gained the iniative and started its offensive in the West! The enemy has attacked on a broad front from the Netherlands to the Ardennes: just as expected. We will conduct our Dyle-plan. While our Armies at the Meuse and the Maginot Line will remain defensive, our Armies more north, including the British Expeditionary Force, will march into Belgium to prevent fighting taking place on French soil.

The 7th Army, that includes your force, forms the far Allied left flank and will drive all the way to Breda in the Netherlands to join up with the Dutch Army. Forward elements of the 7th Army are already crossing the Belgian-Dutch border. Speed is important; the Germans have dropped paratroopers in the Netherlands and at least one Panzer Division is heading towards Rotterdam to join them. You must advance quickly and prevent the enemy from doing so! Vive la France!

GOAL: Take all VH's!

NOTE: Buy an air defense weapon!
