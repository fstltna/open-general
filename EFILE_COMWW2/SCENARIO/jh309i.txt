Advance on El Alamein
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Now that we have stopped the Allied assault on Tunis, it's time for us to move eastwards. Our next objective is El Alamein - the gateway to Egypt. The British are present in great strength, but your past performance indicates that you should be able to overcome them. Again, you must achieve your objectives quickly so we that may maintain our pressure on the British. You are Feldmarschall Rommel's lead commander in this attack!
