Operation Blücher-Yorck - Belleau Wood - June, 1918 - V

Congratulations General. Your attack exceeded all expectations. American reinforcements were pushed aside and the road to Paris is wide open. We might win this great war after all.

Historical events:
- May 27 1918: Operation Blücher-Yorck (Third battle of the Aisne) starts with an attack between Soisson and Reims. The strategic goal is to split French and British forces and gain victory before more American forces reach the battlefield. The French defenses were not developed in depth and the front quickly collapsed. 
- June 1 1918: German forces captured Vaux and Château-Thierry and moved into Belleau Wood. American forces were moved up to check the German advance. Throughout the next weeks, Belleau Wood would change hands multiple times.
- June 3 1918: Victory seemed near with Paris only about 50km away.
- June 6 1918: After many Entente counterattacks and beset by supply shortages, fatigue, lack of reserves and many casualties the offensive had to be halted.
- July and August 1918: After two more mainly unsuccessful German offensives, the initiative moved to the Entente again. Their 100 day offensive would end the war on November 11, 1918.
