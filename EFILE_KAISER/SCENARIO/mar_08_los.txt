Message from General Primo de Rivera's HQ:

Nobody expected such a terrible attack. Even with the help of your troops, the French haven't been able to hold their positions at the Ouergha Valley. They will have to call thousands of fresh troops to recover their lost territories.

Anyway, this battle has made France realise how serious Abd el-Krim's menace really is, so from now on the French will cooperate with us even closer. They will expand the counteroffensive at the Ouergha Valley in order to destroy the Berber strongholds at the mountains, and they will give logistical support to our most ambitious operation: A disembark at Alhucemas Bay, the very heart of the Berber lands. 

For the first time in History such an action will be taken with the combination of land troops and heavy air and naval support. If all goes well, Abd el-Krim's army will be destroyed and he will have to surrender.

Speaking of that matter, I guess you understand that such an innovative operation must be led by a young commander, familiar with the characteristics of modern warfare. With all the respect that you and other veteran officers deserve, it´s time to reform the Spanish army. I think that you'd better ask for a honourable, well earned retirement.
