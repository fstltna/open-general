Well, you managed a win, Commander. You have done a pretty fair job for us in this war and now it is time for you to return to the States to a training command. Your string of victories has left the enemy severely weakened and soon we we have a new "Secret Weapon"  that will end this war quickly without any future bloodbaths of this sort.
