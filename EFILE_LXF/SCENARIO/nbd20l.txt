Commander, you really put us in a bind this time. MacArthur is mad as hell and wants to see heads roll and Nimitz is calling for an investigation. Unfortunately someone has to pay for this tragic mistake. Since most of your men are now dead or missing, it is only fair that their Commander pay the same price. MacArthur asked for volunteers for a firing squad and every surviving member of your unit volunteered. They even had a lottery to determine the "winners." Do you have any special requests for your last meal?
