Salonika: Florina
12 September, 1916

Gospodin General, in April 1916 the Tsar authorized the formation of a Russian Expeditionary Corps.  4 brigades were to be raised:  the 1st and 3rd destined for France and 2nd and 4th for Salonika.  The 2nd Brigade (Diterikhs) reached Salonika on 30 July, 1916 and went in line alongside the 57th and 156th French divisions.  The 4th Brigade (Leontiev) reached Salonika in October.  For both the Entente and the Central Powers, the Salonika Front is a multi-national effort.  You will deploy alongside the Serbian Morava division with the British 22nd in reserve.  On the other side of the line, Bulgarian 6th and 8th divisions alongside the German 101st hold their line.

Our allies in Salonika have been planning an offensive during the entire summer, which resulted in a "spoiling" offensive by the Bulgarian 1st Army in August.  The Serbian Danube division has held to the last fortifications at Florina, but will not hold much longer.  Your offensive must restore our posession of Florina and break through the Bulgaro-German line by capturing the town of Seres.
