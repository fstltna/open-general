Kindralmajor,

Congratulations on your victory over the forces of General Von der Goltz.  Their equipment, training, and organizations are excellent, but are no match for your cunning.

However, we may not celebrate yet.  The German troops have broken through the Latvians' southern flank and are retreating toward Riga.  You must knock them out of the town at all costs.
