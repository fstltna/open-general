Herr Feldmarschall,

The time has come to break the stalemate of the last decade and open a new front against the Japanese mongrels.  You are to take your forces and cross the border here, at Teheran.  

The Japanese line is strong and entrenched; they are a paranoid lot and have been anticipating this action for some time.  If you can breach the line you will have little difficulty encircling and annihilating the other enemy forces in the area; by now I am sure you are familiar with the level of speed necessary to pull off a successful "Blitzkrieg" attack, Herr Feldmarschall.

Do not hesitate to use all of the tools at your disposal.  The Luftwaffe has come up with some new toys that may make this assault easier than anything you ever had to deal with in the previous war.
