The Soviets have become extremely desperate in light of recent Allied success in capturing and holding Volgorad. Intelligence reports that the Soviets have begun testing of a super-heavy tank, which if produced in time for the assault on Moscow could easily turn the tide of the war. This must not happen. Commander, you must take your forces and converge with nearby Allied troops in the area to take the weapons facility and destroy that tank. If we aren't quick enough, the blueprints will almost certainly be transmitted to another Soviet base. Take it out quickly and efficently, Commander. Good luck.
