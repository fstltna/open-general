Second Battle of Gaza  - brilliant victory

Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) infantry brigades succeeded in entering our trenches at several points, but they were too weakened by our fierce defense to retain their gains during our counterattacks. British losses are about 6,000 men, three times as high as ours. Moral in our Army is high!

Historical outcome 
On top of what is reported above, Ottoman forces received further reinforcements. The Weakened EEF dug in and stayed in the trenches opposite Ottoman forces for six months.
