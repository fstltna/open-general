Madrid Offensive

December 23, 1938

	The Civil War in Spain provided a testing ground for the German Wehrmacht, as well as the Soviet and Italian armies. In the battle of Guadalajara, northwest of Madrid, both sides committed some of their best units as the Nationalists tried to cut off Madrid, still held by the Republic despite repeated attacks.
