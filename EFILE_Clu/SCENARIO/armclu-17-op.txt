Steiners Treachery

04/25/1945

Some survivors of the 9th Army went north and withdrew to the bridgehead being formed by the 51st Corps south of Eberswalde. On  April 25th the 25th Panzergrenadier Division was tasked to mount an operation to relief Berlin. This was part of a wildly optimistic plan, conceived by Hitler, for SS-General Felix Steiner and his so called Armygroup Steiner to save the city. After some initial success, the 25th Panzergrenadiers found themselves pinned down at a small bridgehead south of the Ruppiner Canal.
In the ensuing phase of 'Operation Berlin' ,Seydlitz-Troops were active, mingling among the retreating Germans and passing on false instructions.

For a victory you have to take the enemy hexes and hold the bridgehead.
Your deploy hexes (15) are spread over the map. New units have strength 8.
German units are short on ammo and fuel.
