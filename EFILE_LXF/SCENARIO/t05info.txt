After our victory at Damascus, the British realized that they will have to bring in their best troops to stop us! So no secondary units for you, I'm afraid, General haha. But let's get down to business. Damascus is besieged and our Army has advanced towards Beirut, the most important British harbor in the area. Most of our forces here will advance directly to Beirut, but you and your men will come from the east: that means out of the hills and down to the coast and doing so, encircle the British at Beirut. Good luck, General.
