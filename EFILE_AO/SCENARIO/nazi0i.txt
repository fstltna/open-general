Herr Feldmarschall,

I am sorry to disrupt your meeting, but the Americans have taken up arms near the site of your last great victory at Knoxville.  Normally I would not bring this to your attention, but the plant at Oak Ridge is a significant contributor to our nuclear program.  We cannot allow American rebels to seize or destroy any part of our nuclear arsenal.

All fissile material has already been packed up in a truck, awaiting evacuation orders.  The truck is not to be harmed in any way

A portion of your former army has remained behind to watch over the area; return them to your command and wield them as your own.  Troops from the "German-American Union" also operate nearby and can be made to fight for our cause, though their equipment and training are clearly inferior to that of the Wehrmacht.  

Reports indicate that the rebels have somehow managed to preserve a few pieces of military equipment over the last seven years, so you must be aware that there exists a real and present danger to our Oak Ridge plant.  Defend the plant and secure the area.  Herr Hitler will not settle for anything else.
