July 1, 1941

General, as you know, Wehrmacht launched Operation Barbarossa, a large scale attack against the Soviet Union. You are commanding the Carpathian Group (consisting of the mechanized "Rapid Corps") as an attachment of Heeresgruppe Süd. After crossing the Dniester we have reached the defense lines of the Soviet 12th Army at the gates of Tarnopol. Instead of a frontal assault against the dug-in bolsheviks, try to surround them. You will attack in the South while elements of the German 17th Army will form the northern pincer. Good luck, General!

NOTE: You have 22 DHs. Take all VHs!
