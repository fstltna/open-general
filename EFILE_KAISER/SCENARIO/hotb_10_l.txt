What a disappointment! Thank God the French have managed to overcome the Germans, who have retired to the Hindenburg Line. But the performance of the American divisions has been so poor that now all our allies are mocking us. Even the Italians, General! The Italians are making fun of us, do you understand? You've disgraced the American Army and must take responsibility for it. I expect your resignation letter on my desk tomorrow at 7 am.
