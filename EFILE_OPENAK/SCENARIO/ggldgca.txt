Once again your XIX corps let us down Herr General, you are relieved of your command!

General Charles De Gaulle had long believed that Tanks should be used in groups to smash the enemy not as Infantry support which was French military doctrine at the time. After the breakthrough at Sedan he was finally  given command of a hastily formed armoured division called the 4th DCR and allowed free reign. He decided to counter-attack the German panzer corridor at Laon in an attempt to cut the German advance. De Gaulle's first attack on the 17th and second on the 19th were both smashed thanks largely to the 10th Panzer Division which had just arrived after fighting at Stonne.
