The Battle of Noreia

Boiorix, now you got to know the Romans - make them feel fearful from now on!
Together with our brothers the Teutons and Ambrones, you have to destroy the remaining troops of Consul Papirius Carbo!

Notes of historical interest:

The advance of the Germans was blocked by the fortress Noreia and, furthermore, due to the Pontafel Pass being held by the Romans.

When the Noricans called him for help, Consul Gnaeus Papirius Carbo left Pontafel and and approached the Germans.
Carbo initiated negotiations with the Germans and secured their commitment to vacate Norica.
He seconded guides for the negotiating team in order to lead it back to its camp in a roundabout way and took with his Legion  the quickest way to ambush the clueless Germans in their camp.
A serious mistake as it turned out - The Germans overran the normal battle array of the Romans ...
Only a thunderstorm prevented them from extermination.
