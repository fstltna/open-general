March 7th, 1902

After Ysterspruit the British have renewed their attempts to capture us. One of the British forces that is taking part in this operation is commanded by none other than Lord Mehuen, the general that we faced at the Moddeer River and Magersfontein.

Methuen is heading to Lichtenburg with 1,300 men and he's decided to destroy us. Wouldn't it be great to ambush his column and turn the hunter into prey?

Victory conditions:
- Destroy 10 of the 12 British units (all of them are MSUs).
- Your MSU core unit must survive.
