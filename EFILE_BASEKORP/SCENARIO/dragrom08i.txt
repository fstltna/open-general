     Taman Bridgehead : Evacuation - 21 Sep 1943
___________________________________________

      Despite the superiority of soviet forces the battle for Taman Peninsula was fought on German's OKH terms which decided the moments of withdrawal on defensive lines and also the time for the evacuation.  The decision to evacuate was not a result of defeats in Taman but because of unfavorable unfolding operations to the north of Azov Sea .
      The evacuation operations, started in mid september, surprised at first the soviet forces which after 22 Sep managed to organize efforts to disrupt the retreat with landings in the rear of the defensive lines both on Black Sea and Azov Sea coastline.
