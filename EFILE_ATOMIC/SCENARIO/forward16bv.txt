Great job. The Germans got a bloody nose. They have wasted all of their reserves and it seems that they have no capabilities to lead a further big attack. After your success our troops in the north of the Kursker salient could break to the German lines. Because of this they stopped all attacks on the Kursker salient. It gives me pleasure to told you that the USA and Great Britain has landed on Sicily.
