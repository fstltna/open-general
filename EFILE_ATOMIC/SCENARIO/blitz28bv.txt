Herr General, this victory is worthy of great praise. The Allies's attempted breakout has been stopped and now the only part of France they still hold is the area around Cherbourgh.  Unfortunately, while we were fighting the Allies the Bolsheviks stabbed us in the back!  They broke our peace treaty and with most of our troops tied up in Western Europe and Afrika have been able to rampage across Eastern Europe. You must quickly move on Cherbourgh and force the Allies from Europe, so that we may transfer troops to the East.
