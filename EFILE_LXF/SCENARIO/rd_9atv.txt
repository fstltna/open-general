Comrade General, this came very close to being a debacle.  Many brave Soviet soldiers were lost to secure the Dover coast. 

Do not disappoint us in your next battle Comrade General.  It is the most important battle you will ever fight, and Comrade Stalin will be watching.  This, I can assure you.
