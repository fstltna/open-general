General, it is my duty to inform you that you are under arrest. In consideration of your rank, General Cadorna will allow you to keep your sabre and your pistol while you are under the custody of the Italian army. Although I think that you won't be our prisoner for too long. It would surprise me that the Austro- Hungarian Empire didn't surrender in less than two months.
