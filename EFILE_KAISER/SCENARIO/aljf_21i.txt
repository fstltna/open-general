October, 25., 1864  Petersburg


Dear Friend,
our army corps has reached Petersburg...from here important roads and rails lead in all directions....but especially Petersburg controls the last working railway to Richmond...
by now we only control the area east of Petersburg.... 
Trying to undermine the confederate fortifications south-east of Petersburg, sappers already created a huge crater in the rebel position. But it has been of little use as the walls of the crater are too steep to climp up, our attack commando has been brutally killed in attempting to make it up...
We will see what the HQ plans for my corps....

ORDERS:
General, looking at our forces, I still feel that it is impossible to take Petersburg frontally; but with the support of your army corps we are able to lay siege to Petersburg and cut it off from all connections...
Doing this, we also have encircled the rebel capital Richmond.

Transports delivering reinforcements will arrive from the east and our cavalry will be here soon coming from the south-east

TAKE ALL VH's


ADVICE FROM YOUR OLDEST SERGEANT:
In the beginning, move forward with care and stay connected.
We should concentrate on our goals in the west; our cavalry corps will be very useful later there..
