Battle of Warszawa: Poland's last chance

August 13th, 1920

The Soviet offensive has been too strong. Again and again we have been forced to retreat and now the Russian Red Army is ready for its final assault on Warszawa. As the Russian troops cross the Wkra River and advance towards Modlin Fortress, our defeat seems inminent. In a few days Poland could cease to exist as an independent state.

The Russians want to break our defences north of Warszawa so they would be able to strike from behind the city. Our last hope is the counterattack that commander Józef Pilsudski is preparing from the south. But in the meantime you and your troops, as well all the rest of the Polish 5th Army under General Wladyslaw Sikorski, will have to defend the northern area near the Modlin Fortress from an enemy that has superior numbers. 

Victory conditions: Take all VHs.

Intelligence report: On turn 3 you will receive reinforcements coming from the west.

Good luck!
