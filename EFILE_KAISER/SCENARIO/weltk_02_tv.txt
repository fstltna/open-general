Well, it's been a victory, indeed, although a pyrrhic one. The French counterattack is imminent, and since we haven't been able to dig in, I'm afraid that we'll lose much of the terrain that you've just gained. The fighting in Hartmannsweilerkopf isn't over. There will be many skirmishes in the following months until the front stabilizes again.
However, your victory has called the attention of the OHL, and it's been decided that you and your men will be transferred to the Belgian border. Good luck, General, you'll need it on your new destination.
