Excellent work commander! The vast lands of Russia and all their resources are ours at last!
With this amount of resources, nobody can resist us - As the Americans will soon discover.

In the meanwhile, let the 2nd line troops take care of the last pockets of resistance. Take my plane and fly back to Berlin, you are a national hero and will be celebrated as such!
