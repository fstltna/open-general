General, you failed to push back French and British forces that are now in an excellent position to launch follow-up attacks. Luckily we have more prepared defensive lines to fall back to.

Historical events:
After the battle of Pilkem Ridge, British commander Haigh kept on launching more attacks North and East of Ypres throughout August, looking for a breakthrough. The results were small gains of terrain at higher and higher costs. All until the British got completely stuck after capturing Passchendaele in a final attack early November. All reserves of the British army were spent.
