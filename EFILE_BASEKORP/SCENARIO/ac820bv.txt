Come in General! A toast of mulled wine!

Your troops fought like demons, and that is the word of several Russian prisoners that we have taken!

We have made contact with 6th Army, but, Hitler refused to allow a withdrawl!  4th Panzer Army and our forces are to hold this corridor open for the entire winter if need be!

Manstein has reportedly flown to Berlin to confer directly with Hilter on the reality of the situation, Madness!

Pray for us General, pray for us all that Manstein is successful!
