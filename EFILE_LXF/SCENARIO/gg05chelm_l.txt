Totally appalling work by your XIX corps Herr General, for you the war is over.

At 5pm on the 18th of september the supply column of the 3rd Panzer Division arrived to refuel the vehicles and they set off towards Chelm. They advanced slowly due to bad and blocked roads and destroyed bridges. Only isolated pockets of resistance are ecountered but the division suffers it's highest losses of the campaign so far this day. The lead units enter the outskirts of Chelm and OKW reports suggest a meeting between Heers Groups Nord and Sud here, but this was never substantiated.
von Schweppenburg decides to assemble his wide spread division at Wlodawa where eventually they are relieved before shipping back to Germany.
