Good work Majuri!
Due to our crushing victory the enemies' advance has been stopped. From captured documents we know that the Soviets have planned to break through to Oulu at the Gulf of Bothnia. This would cut Finland in two and would lead to our defeat, but I haven't yet told you the best. Come to my headquarters...
