Free Leningrad
More then two years ago the Germans began with their blockade of Leningrad. The pitful population of the town had to feel the pinch of hunger. We want to stop the blockade and push the Germans back. In the south and in the central sovietunion the Germans are withdrawed. I am sure they will withdraw their troops, if we will be able to lauch a great attack on the 16th Army.
Your troops:
You will only have your tank army for this mission, but we have allocated two divisions with bridging engineers to your troops, because the Germans have destroyed the bridges. 
Enemy troops:
The 16th Army still have some strong troops, but the best of the Germans are fighting in the south and in the central. So the 16th Army has only a few tank divisions. Mostfull infantry divisions will be your opponent.
