Clash at Kondoa

After the battle of Kahe, Van Deventer 2nd Division reached Kondoa Irangi and after light German resistance took the town. During its advance, his forces had lost more than 2,000 horses to the Tsetse fly and so its mobility was very restricted. He was ordered to entrench in Kondoa and await reinforcements. When the rainy season began Van Deventer's forces had severe supply problems and were cut off from the rest of British units. Meanwhile, von Lettow-Vorbeck reinforced his units around the town and planned to recapture it.
