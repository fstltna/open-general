"Look at that Cawells,isn't She beautiful.A shame to send Her to the bottom.I must say those Broads in Germany have as fine a looking battleship as I have ever seen".Commander Cawells looked through the periscope.The Polish sub 'Orzel had a SS/KM battleship in it's sight.A Torpedo spread was fired."Their true to center Lispke,this should be some fireworks and We can at least speak of Victory from under the sea".The countdown was made,only 1 Explosion."Faulty weapons again,Lispke.Raise the periscope let's see the damage.Dam another vessel got in the way,small fry not worth registering in the log but do it anyway.Let's get out of here".The 'Orzel moved out into deeper waters and made a run for Dennmark.The SS Air Korps hounded it for 40 minutes finally giving up,too much allotment of forces for a single Polish fish when there was better targets on the land.From Dennmark to England the 'Orzel traveled but with a faulty radio it could not communicate with the Brits.Finally putting some Men ashore they made contact just in time to see a Brit Coastal bomber drop bombs damaging the 'Orzel.The 'Orzel would not get back into action for 8 months and of course by that time Poland would be no more.Later exploits of the 'Orzel would be Legend and of course it's end would too.It being one of a number of subs struck by it's own Torpedo when the sound guidance would error sending the wayward fish back in the waters off Casablanca to destroy the sub.
