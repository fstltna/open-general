Welcome General, please sit down.

Mussilini has managed to persuade Hitler to let us finish the Greeks, Hitler is apparently eager to do other things this Summer, interesting......

In any case, we must force the British off the mainland to secure our hold on the Balkans, this should not be difficult with our new Axis partners of Hungary and Romania.

STAFF INTEL:  The British will show their usual resilience but slow to maneuver.  The RAF will be active.  The only Greek presence will be some partisan activity.
