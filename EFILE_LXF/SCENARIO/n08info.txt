WONJU DEEP RAID (7 January 1951)

Sorry for the interruption, Comrade General.  Orders have been given to continue the offensive.  We have reached the important communication center of Wonju.  The town is expected to be heavily guarded by capitalist forces, most likely to prevent an uprising of the Korean people against the imperialists!  Your Corps will attack due south and slip around Wonju from the east.  Making good use of the hills will allow you to penetrate deep into the enemy line.  Our V Corps will keep the forces west and north of Wonju occupied.  The enemy is gaining strength but we have still have them reeling.  Race forward, Comrade General!  Free Korea!
