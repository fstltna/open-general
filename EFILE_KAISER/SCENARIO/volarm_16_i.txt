Kharkov

Dec 4th, 1919

Due to my past defeat, in the following weeks Denikin only assigned secondary tasks to me. I can't blame him for that. My failure has prevented us from taking Moscow and, possibly, has cost us the war. Our army has been unable to stop the Soviet counterattacks, and it has been forced to retreat from most of the towns that it had taken during the summer. In fact, many of our divisions are on the verge of destruction.
The situation is so desperate that Denikin has had no choice but to employ all of his available officers, including myself. Three days ago he gave me the command of the area of Kharkov, in Ukraine. He's ordered me to stop the initial Soviet assault and hold the city as long as I can, thus giving the rest of our army the opportunity to regroup and retreat in order to the Donbass and the Kuban.

Victory conditions: 
- After 12 turns you must hold 5 VHs for a BV, 4 VHs for a V or 3 VHs for a TacV.
