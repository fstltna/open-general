So you've been wounded by enemy fire. I'm sorry to hear about that, General. Well, at least you're alive, and the doctors say that you'll recover after some months of rest. Don't worry about the war, now the priority is your health and your well-being. Replacing you won't be easy at all, but we'll find a way to get the job done. Don't think about it now, and just focus on your recovery.
