Good to see you again so soon General!

Our drive from Oslo to Lillehammer went more quickly than expected, the Norwegians are already asking for terms!

I must commend your forces, your drive up the right was fantastic in this rugged country.  I was happy to report directly to the Furher himself of our success, and he said he would call Mussilini to send his personal gratitude.

Cheers General!
