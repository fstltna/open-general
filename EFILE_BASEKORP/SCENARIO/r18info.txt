18. NOVOROSSIYSK 3 (9 September 1943)

The time has come to destory the enemy on the Kuban steppes. They have been there for far too long. And finally, after months of preparations, we are in position for a full-scale attack on the fascist perimeter. Near Kursk, our units are rolling west again. We must follow and make the enemy see that the Red Army has arisen from its ashes! 

Your force will attack towards Novorossiysk and beyond. Attacks will come from the bridgehead south of Novorossiysk, as well as along the coastal front. The Black Sea Fleet has once again committed Marines who are waiting to get revenge for their fallen comrades, months earlier. So attack, and let nothing stop you! The enemy is still strong and willing to resist so prepare for a ferious battle. We accept not anything less than the complete destruction of the enemy in the Novorossiysk area! Good luck, comrade.
