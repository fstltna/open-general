07. FEODOSIYA (29 December 1941)

On the central front, near Moskva, we have pushed the fasicsts armies almost hundred kilometers back, away from our capitol. Rostov is once again in Soviet hands. Sevastopol on the Crimea remains under our control but the remaining part of the Crimean peninsula is occupied by the Rumanian and German fascists. The enemy is attacking Sevastopol for days and without support it will fall. We must make sure this will not happen. Therefore we will invade the eastern Crimea at both Kerch and at Feodosiya. 

You will lead our forces at the Feodosiya operation. From the Taman peninsula you will land at various places around the town of Feodosiya, which lies on the connection of the Kerch peninsula with the larger Crimean peninsula. The German forces are stretched to defend the coasts but they should be ready to counterattack once you have landed. So be quick, land your forces and attack!
