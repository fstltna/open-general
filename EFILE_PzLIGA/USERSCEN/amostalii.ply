AMONAS STALINGRAD v2.01

At the beginning of September 1942 the 6th German Army under general Paulus, supported by units of general Hoth's 4th Panzer Army in its southern flank, began the assault on the very city of Stalingrad. For the defenders, the 62nd Soviet Army under general Chuikov, the slogan had been spread: 'There is no land behind the Volga for us!'. Thus one of the bloodiest and most merciless battles of the war developed.

In the second half of August violent German bomb attacks, killing more than 40,000 civilians, had transformed the city into an expanse of rubble. Paradoxically, this favored the defense extremely.

In addition STAVKA, the Soviet supreme command, continuously fed the 62th army with fresh forces from the eastern side of the river. On the other hand, the Germans' power decreased more and more  ...

A further important factor was the - apart from air raids - indisputable position of the Soviet heavy artillery on the eastern Volga bank.

All these factors let the Soviets persist in a narrow strip of the city on the Volga bank. Until November the Wehrmacht did not manage to throw Chuikov's remaining troops into the river. Rather the mass of the 6th Army kept being bound to Stalingrad, until on November 19 the Soviet counter-offensive northerly and southerly of the city led to the encircling and later destruction of the 6th Army. 

Already at that time, Germans in the Reich felt this was the turning point of the war. Psychologically, in the conscience of the German people, Stalingrad was the turning point, indeed. 

Can you manage to conquer the city already in September with YOUR 6th Army?
Or do you prefer to stop the fascist aggressors as Chuikov?
It's up to you ...
