Kiev

Part 1/3 of the "Battles of the Brigade" minicampaign.

*****

After the battle of Sokolovo the battalion was extended into the 1st Czechoslovak Independent Brigade which numbered roughly 3500 men and women. Czechoslovaks got new weapons, including field, antiaircraft and antitank artillery, machine guns, armoured cars and even twenty tanks.

At the beginning of November 1943, the brigade took a part in the Battle of Kiev...

Intelligence and reconnaisance: Germans are firmly entrenched in the city and they have AA guns, artillery support and air-cover. On their left flank, just behind the antitank ditch, the 7th Tank Division is placed. Its force is depleted and many tanks fight in other sectors, but you still face some twenty armoured vehicles.

Reinforces: None.

Hint: Don't forget that you may use the city's SH as your own.

Note: From this moment the campaign's scale has changed - one unit represents a battalion.

Victory conditions: Capture all VHs.
