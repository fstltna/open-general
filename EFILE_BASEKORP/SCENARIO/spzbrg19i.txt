Kursk

Part 2/3 of the "Zurueck in USSR" minicampaign


"Wilkommen, Herr Generalmajor! Here is the new intelligence report about the Soviet defense. I wish that it wasn't that depressing, but the photographs don't lie. What stands before you is another set of extremely strong defensive lines with horrid ammounts of infantry, bunkers, barbed wires, mines, field, antitank and luftschutz artillery. There are immense numbers of tanks, assault guns and self-propelled cannons in reserve, so wherever we break through, the Soviets can cement the hole. Vast numbers of aircraft are also ready right behind their lines and those are skilled pilots, if we may guess. Personally, I believe that the scenario... pardon, the area... is so full of enemy units that if the Soviets wished to bring one more soldier here, they'd need to remove one another first.

Good luck!"


Victory conditions: Capture all VHs.

Hint: After initial success, the German armies more and more flounder in the extremely strong and deep Soviet defense. One line after another falls down, just to be followed by yet another one... Every time the Germans get through, they lose men, machines, time, patience and morale...
There are no reserves or reinforcements.
