Strike on Kontum

November, 1967

Comrade commander, we again needed your men. As you know, our operations in the province of Kontum in the middle of this year have gone well, nevertheless there are still several enemy forward bases that we must destroy. Those bases are so close to our route of supplying ' ' Ho Chi Minh' ', and of our area 609, reason why they must be eradicated. In addition, apparently a enemy offensive in the province of Kontum is approached, and our enemies do not have to count on those outposts.

Victory Conditions:

- Destroy the three advanced enemy bases Dak Pek, Dak Seang and Dak To.

or

- Capture Kontum.
