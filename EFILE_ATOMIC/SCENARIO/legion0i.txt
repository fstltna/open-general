SITUATION: 

Comandante, you are ordered to command a small legion of combined arms, which is already on its way to Libya. 

The Senussi Order is not accepting our rule over the Libyan coast and our local forces met strong guerrilla resistance of Senussi tribal fighters lead by sheikh Omar Mukhtar. They frequently raid our coastal cities and supply lines. Our control over the area reaches barely 10 miles into the desert. The situation in the Derna area is critical.

ORDERS: 

Make landfall with your troops, assist the local forces and repell all enemy attacks. Then move into the hinterland and capture the Senussi stronghold. Take all VHs in 12/14/16 turns for a BV/V/TV.

NOTE:

Your legion's small air force is already stationed at Susa airfield.
