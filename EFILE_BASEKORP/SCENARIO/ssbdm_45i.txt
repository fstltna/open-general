   Tank Battle on the Volga  11/11/42
 "Yes Fuhress,PZ Gp Neffer has just arrived.No I don't know where General Pedderson is,She's always on the move trying to inspire the Fraus,wouldn't be surprised She isn't in one of the Frau Jadgpanthers ready to roll over the Ivans herself.Yes I know,We cross the Volga here and Moscow is Ours.Air-recons spotted the Soviets heading Our direction,the Stuka's are aloft and pounding them now.There's so many it will still be a murderous fight but Stalins played His final hand here.Frau Renveldt has informed Us She has spotted no Armor at all facing Her now except the small tanks so She should be able to roll up the Front in the Center when We commence Our attack here from the North.Inga has informed Us all Gruppens will cover Our area,this should be some show,fitting to this Great Struggle of the SS/BdM against the Bolshevik Hordes.It is near it's End,Moscow in Our hands,Stalin dead or running and the Soviet Goverment will crumble. The World will finally see what You prophesized before We even took on France is coming to be.Your Greatness will surely go down in History as the most able War Commander of all time even if You do wear a Skirt and High Heels.And I as the Other Generals and all the Fraus commend You,there has never been anyone like You or will there ever be".
