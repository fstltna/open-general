Frau Admiral Zera was stunned.What had just happened?The Brits and their Royal Navy,the Pride of that Navy the 'Hood not a match for the Girls aboard the SS/KM Fleet.The shells from the Big guns had been on target enough to ravage the Royal Navies battlewagons. Zera watched as the Flyers of the Air Korps went over to chase the small boats running back to 'Winstons arms.The 'Wohr moved slowly through the carnage of Brit ships still afloat.The 'Hood was listing to starboard and would soon be going under.Brit Admiral Holland was boarding a lifeboat and stood at attention ordering the others to do the same and gave the 'Wohr a salute."That's Big of Him,isn't it Zera" Frau Captain Missy Warner stated."Yes I must admit,in all the World the Brits show class no matter what the situation.I admire them for that.As soon as the 2 'Fuhress Class Battleships are put to sea they should get a lot more chances to show it in defeat.This Day will go down as one of the most monumental in the annals of naval history.Now let's get back to Our Duty,We must get to port and repair Our damage and give Respect for the Dead".In Berlin the Fuhress on hearing the result of the battle stated "a 'Miracle has been delivered into My hands,this will have to affect the Enemies moral".In London Churchill retired to His Library to gulp down some Spirits and cuss the 'Fraus who were only worthy of Cooking,Cleaning and Bearing Bastard SS Children.
