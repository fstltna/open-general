The British 1st Division has ceased to exist as an able fighting force. Cecil Rhodes will have to wait in Kimberley a little longer before some gallant English knight goes to his rescue, ha, ha. And I'm glad to inform you that near Ladysmith General Botha has beaten a large British force, too. This has been an excellent week!

But the war is far from over.The enemy will sent massive reinforcements very soon, so you must be ready for even harder battles. Colesberg will be your next destination.
