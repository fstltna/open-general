EL AlAMEIN OPERATION SUPERCHARGE November 1942 L

Our anti-tank screen at the Rahman track collapsed and even the heroic performance of Ariete could not stop 8th Army. Your actions did allow some of the DAK remnants to retreat. Unfortunately we had to write off most of the non-motorized X (Brescia, Folgore, Pavia) and XXI (Trento, Bologna) Corps. The remnants of your XX Corps are renamed Battlegroup Ariete. 

With strong Allied mobile forces on our tail, the first really defendable position is El Agheila - more than 1000km to the West.
