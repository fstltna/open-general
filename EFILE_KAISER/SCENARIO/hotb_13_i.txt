Argonne

October 4th, 1918

Hi, General, welcome back! It must be tiring to cross most of France in just a few days, but I hope that you're ready for more action.  

The Franco- American offensive on the Meuse and the Argonne region started while you were away, more than a week ago. I must say that it's been a complete success. The German lines of defence have been destroyed and our enemies are retreating in good order to the north, towards Sedan.

We cannot let that happen. We must hit them now, before they have time to build new defences. But, of course, our first line units are exhausted, so we need your experience one more time. Pursue the Germans, harass them and force them to run for their lives. They're on the brink of defeat, and they just need a final push. Good luck!

Victory conditions:
- Take all the enemy VHs.
