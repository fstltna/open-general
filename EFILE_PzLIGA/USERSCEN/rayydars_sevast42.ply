Sevastopol 1942

The 1942 siege of the Crimean capital Sevastopol by the Wehrmacht's 11th army, commanded by the legendary Erich von Manstein. This scenario is historically correct concerning date and fortifications. Other units are roughly historical (2 German, 1 Romanian corps), but more or less fictitious in detail. 

The Soviet amphibious landing on the south-eastern coast has been implemented to just spice up the scenario and to make a defender victory possible. It actually took place in 1941 and then forced v. Manstein, fearing to get cut off the Ukrainian mainland, to retreat from Sevastopol. Will this happen again?
