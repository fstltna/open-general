Villers-Cotterêts

September 1st, 1914

The following week we continued our retreat into France, and even though Von Kluck's German First Army went after us, they did not dare to engage us in combat.
This was going to change the first of September, when our 1st Cavalry Brigade had to fight at Néry against a German division. That delayed the march of all the British forces, so the German III Corps had an opportunity to get close to our I Corps. For that reason I was ordered to take positions at the Retz Forest and cover the retreat of the other units

(from the memoirs of Lt. Gen. Bruce W. Dickinson)

Victory conditions:
- You must destroy 28 out of 36 German MSUs.
- Your MSU core unit must survive.
