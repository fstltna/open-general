The First World War - The Gallipoli Landings - April 1915 - V

Général, you and your men have fought bravely, nobody can deny that! Even those snobbish British generals have to admit that it has been the French Army that has set an example of adorable valour here at Gallipoli. But finally we had to accept that the Turkish reinforcements were just too much for our depleted forces. We had to call off the offensive, before we could reach Krithia. Now we have to dig in and hold our position for the time being.

HISTORICAL EVENTS:

After the costly setbacks during the initial landings, the allied advance on Krithia was stopped by the Turks on April 28th, and in some places the British and French were even driven back to their starting positions. Another 3,000 allied troops lost their lives on a devastating day that left the infantry men exhausted, demoralized and virtually leaderless due to an appaling breakdown of command. The high hopes for a swift and crushing victory at Gallipoli vanished and the whole campaign turned into trench warfare.
