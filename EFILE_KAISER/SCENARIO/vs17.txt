2nd Ypres - Gravenstafel Ridge - Chlorine Gas Test - April 22nd 1915

With the bulk of our reserves sent to the Eastern front to save our Austro-Hungarian allies, there is not much we can do here on the Western front but to repulse Entente attacks like the one at Neuve Chapelle last month.

General von Falkenhayn has however ordered us to attack at Ypres to test the first use of poisonous gas by our army and to divert attention away from his proposed offensive on the Eastern Front. Attacks south of Ypres have been delayed time and time again due to the wind blowing in the wrong direction. That is why your troops North of Ypres have gotten the order to dig in gas cylinders between the German and Entente front lines and to open them as soon as the wind blows strong enough in a favourable direction.

The first set of cylinders will be opened in the sector opposite the French 87th Territorial Division and the in this sector newly arrived 45th Algerian Division. Your largely volunteer 46th Reserve, 53th Reserve and 54th Reserve Divisions are expected to advance South to the Gravenstafel Ridge. More attacks supported by gas might be launched here around Ypres if this attack is successful.

Player orders: Capture all victory hexes in time for Brilliant Victory or Victory to trigger a follow-up attack in the next scenario. Tactical Victory or Loss will end this gas experiment and will make you move back to defensive operations.

Notes: 
- The gas units will disappear in turn 2, so make use of them straight away.
- Losses will not be automatically replaced at the end of the scenario.
