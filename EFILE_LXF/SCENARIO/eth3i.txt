BATTLE OF TEMBIEN

December 15th, 1935 (Tigray Province, Northern Ethiopia)

The Ethiopian counter-attack.

Almost simultaneously at the end of November 1935, the two rival war-leaders reached their new headquarters in the North. Dessie for Haile Selassie and Makalle for Badoglio.

Badoglio was not particularly happy with the situation.
It was too reminiscent of Adowa (Italian defeat against the Ethiopians in 1896) on a large scale: divisions this time strung out in a long line with sketchy communications between them and the Ethiopians massing in front, ready to pounce on first one and then another isolated group.

Badoglio had no doubt that the Ethiopians were massing. All the air-reconnaissance reports brought news of approaching armies. It seemed hardly the moment for the great push forward from Makalle, which would only lengthen his lines of communications and leave an even greater gap in the Italian centre into which the Ethiopians might drive.

On 15 December, as Ras Imru and Ayalew Birru's men crossed the Takazze River, the army of Wag attacked in the Tembien. Dejaz Haile Kebbede led his army of Wag, now 10,000 strong. Their morale was high, though only one man in six had a rifle and the whole force had only TWO OR THREE MACHINE-GUNS.
