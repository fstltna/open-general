Tragedy at Ekaterinodar

Apr 9th, 1918

Our explorers confirm our worst fears. The defences of Ekaterinodar are strong and the communists outnumber us at least three to one. However, Kornilov is determined to attack. The Bolsheviks are growing stronger every day and if we leave they'll eventually find us and crush us. The general knows that a frontal attack would be suicidal, so he has ordered a flanking maneuver on Elizabetinskaya. That could surprise the Reds and, with the help of a handful of Cossacks that have joined us, might give us a chance.

Victory conditions: Take all the VHs.

Special notes:
- The unit that takes Elizabetinskaya will obtain a leader.
- From now on you'll be able to buy Cossack equipment.
