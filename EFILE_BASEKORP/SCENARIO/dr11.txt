Kiev encirclement - Konotop September1941

After 19 days of indecisiveness - known as the 19 day interregnum, Hitler has decided you and the rest of Guderian's 2nd Pz Gruppe need turn South to assist Von Rundstedt's less successful Armee Gruppe Sud in the encirclement of Kiev - Ukrain - 350 km South of here. You are to make contact with von Kleist's 1 Pz Gruppe South of Konotop to complete the encirclement. The capture of Moscow will have to wait. Opposing your forces is the newly created Russian 40th Army assisted by the 2nd Air-landing Corps and the 10th Tank Division.
