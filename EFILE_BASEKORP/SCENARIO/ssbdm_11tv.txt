"Whoaa Hell Willa look at that go up.That whole dam Amerikan battleship blew apart.The fire must of reached the magazine section.What a Rush,I'm pissing all over myself.We may die here in the next few minutes but what on Gods Earth could compare to these Dam giant shells flying around and missing or hitting their targets. I've got to sit down My knees are shaking so bad.Glad I decided to go to sea and fight for the Fatherland.If we live through this engagement the stories We tell will have no equals.And this 'Biss and 'Tirptz,far Superior to anything out here this day"."Hey what the Hell You two doing there,get Your sorry Asses back on that AA gun,who told You You could get off of it?You want one of the Brit Torpedo planes to give You an enema right up Your butt"."Sorry Lt. Curll"."You'll be sorry if I catch You off that Gun again".Willa and Stenny got back to the flak gun.Later Brit Swordfish bombers came through the Hell of aa and sent destructive fish towards the ship.Three Torpedoes hit the Armor belt doing minor damage as 8 planes were shot down.This day the Fuhress Class Battleships sent the message the Atlantic was now a very perilous place to sail if You were not Flying the SS/KM Flag.Add into the fray the Wolfpacks and Britians Convoys went from 87 percent getting through to Zero percent on this Convoy and less than 65 percent on later travels. Britian would starve on less than 71 percent getting through.
