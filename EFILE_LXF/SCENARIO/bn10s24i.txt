
STALINGRAD - 8 JUN 1942

Southeast of Stalingrad, South Russia

Our 15th Panzer Division had already occupied the eastern Volga River bank opposite to Stalingrad and blocked the river passage. In the West, our troops have closed the ring around Stalingrad and will reach the city limits in a few days. Until then, you must prevent that enemy reinforcements reach Stalingrad! Divide your forces - with the stronger part reinforce the 15th Panzer Division and parry all attempts of the enemy to cross the river! Pass the Volga River with the other part (deploy this force at SH direct in naval transport) and support our incoming troops in the conquest of Stalingrad!

GOAL: Take all VH's!

4th turn - southwest, 100th light Infantry-Division
5th turn - southwest, 3rd Panzer-Division
6th turn - west, 29th Infantry-Division (mot.)
