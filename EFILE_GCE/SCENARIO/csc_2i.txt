Ofensiva de Guadalajara

March 8th, 1937

Buenos dias general. The Italians are preparing an assault themselves on to Madrid... The CTV generals are believing they will be able to hit hard to the Republicans, but, we shall see what the Italians will do!. You are going to take part in the offensive with a couple of your best units...

Buena suerte.
