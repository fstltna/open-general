Domokos - Tactical Victory

Knowing that if they stayed at Domokos they would eventually be crushed, the Greeks retreated during the night. The road to Athens is open. Well done!

Historical outcome
The Turks didn't waste any time, and as soon as the battle of Domokos was won they advanced to Thermopylae, taking that pass, too. 
The Great powers of Europe feared that Athens could fall, so on May 20th they forced the Ottomans to accept an armistice. Greece had to cede minor areas on its northern border and pay heavy reparations (4 million Ottoman pounds). Since Greece was an insolvent country, it had to accept an International Financial Control commission, which in effect diverted the Greek state's main income sources  to the repayment of Greece's public loans. Crete however did become an autonomous state under international supervision, while remaining under the Sultan's suzerainty.
