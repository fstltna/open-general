The conquest of Egypt is almost a fact, General! Only days ago when we crossed the Suez Canal, General Rommel broke through at El Alamein. Italian forces are making their way to Alexandria while mobile German forces of the DAK are pressing towards Cairo, the capital of Egypt. Your forces are at the outskirts of Cairo and elements of the German 15th Pz Division will soon join you. Together you must capture thee bridges over the famous Nile river and cut Egypt in two! When this is acomplished Allied forces will either be captured in the Nile Delta and Alexandria or have to fled south along the Nile where we will chase them down like Gazelles! But first join with the DAK and capture the bridges over the Nile river in Cairo. Good luck, General!
