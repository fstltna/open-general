    "If it wasn't for the Frau-Z's"  06/19/42
  Because of SS Armor units chewing up the Soviet armor Joseph Stalin had shifted His production more towards the Air and AA,especially Fighters.The SS/BdM was now in a Fight for their Lives.The Soviets though maimed and bruised were not down for the Final Count in the Skies west or north of Moscow.Soviet Pilots who had escaped after being shot down many times now were as experienced as the SS.Though the Female Pilots of the Air Korps had incredible kill numbers the Soviets with still their number advantage were starting to make the Air War a contest in every area except one.That was when the Soviets tangled with Junker's Frau-Z.The Frau-Z was a cut above.It could outrun the Soviets if it had to by using a Special additive ( Blitztrycessaran) increasing the Horsepower for a short time and the 'Musik' guns which pointed up tricked many a inexperienced Soviet Pilot who had no ideal they could level off and fire to the rear.Every third shell firing from the 20mm Auto-cannons also had the effect of a Shot-gun shell which played havoc with the Enemies planes also exploding too soon at times bringing down a few Frau-Z's by blowing off the Tail.Defensively the Junkers Warbird had redundant fuel and contol systems.And of course the best Frau Pilots flew the Frau-Z.So with Moscow soon to be under the Gun Stalin was playing His Cards that He hoped could 'Trump the Frau-Z's, Numbers.On the Ground He had failed,could He Win in the Air.
