Another great victory!  The German troops have rid themselves of most of their pursuers.  Now they will be able to invade Portuguese East Africa with little opposition.

Historical aftermath: Following Von Lettow's own words, Mahiwa was a "brilliant victory" for his army. It was the bloodiest African battle of WWI for the British army.  It suffered more than 2,500 casualties. However, the German losses were also high and few German soldiers managed to cross the Rovuma river into Portuguese East Africa.
