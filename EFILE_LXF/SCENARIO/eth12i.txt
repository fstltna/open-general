BATTLE OF GOGETTI

February 18th, 1937 (Gurage Region, Shoa Province, Ethiopia)

The figure who really inspired the resistance in the south-east was one of the Italians' oldest and fiercest enemies, Dejaz Gabremariam. Sent Down from Dessie by the Emperor to reconcile Ras Desta and his Fitauraris.  He had only half-succeeded in that but had wholly succeeded in restoring a fighting spirit and a coherent front against the enemy.

It was Gabremariam to whom the Sidamo nobles looked for leadership; and though Ras Desta's personal courage was never doubted, it was Gabremariam who with 4000 men had barred the Italian advance throughout the rainy season.

Ras Desta and Dejaz Gabremariam crossed into Bale and finally joined forces with Dejaz Beiene Merid. Beiene Merid had about 3000 men and the reduced army of Sidamo cannot have numbered many more.

General Nasi now took overall command of operations and ORDERED DOWN A COLUMN OF LIBYAN BATTALIONS under General Kubeddu. 

On 17 February, a lorried column that came down from Addis Ababa commanded by Captain Tucci and consisting mainly of Dejaz Toclu Meshesha's Tigrean Banda made contact; on the 18th they attacked.
