The First World War - Krivolak - 22nd, Nov. 1915- BV

Général, you've managed to stop the Bulgarian attacks for a while. Unfortunately, the Serbian Army has been nearly destroyed, so there is no need to keep on fighting in Macedonia at the moment. You may evacuate your forces south of the Greek border, while the British embark the surviving Serbian troops to the island of Corfou.

The Bulgarian Army isn't big enough to fully recover from their losses, and the Germans can't send more soldiers to the area, so the Balkan Front will stabilize pretty soon. However, I'm afraid that we'll have to retreat from the Dardanelles. Russia won't receive any help by sea. I hope they'll be able to take care of themselves.

Now you must return to France. Both sides are preparing new offensives at the Western Front, and your experience will be needed there. Good luck!
