Herr General, it is your privilege to lead our attack here, on the Dnepr River, in the Ukranian heartland. A successful offensive here will sever communications between Kiev and Rostov and trap several Soviet armies. It is, of course, imperative to take your objectives quickly. Our thoughts are with you.
