Orders:

While the creation of the Anzio beachhead was successful, the 5th Army still is stuck at the German Gustav Line. 

After the bombing of the Monte Cassio Abby on 15th February German Paratroopers are using the ruins of the Abby as fortress. 

Your orders are to capture Monte Cassion, overcome the Gustav Line and push westwards in order to connect with the Anzio beachhead and march for Rome later on. For the upcomming operation you will take command of Polish, Canadian, British and Free French Forces, which will fight alongside your core troops. Good Luck, Commander!
