Operation White Sword - Luga
September 29, 1919

Kindralleitnant, the time has come for our fall offensive against the Bolshevik forces.  The overall strategic situation looks very promising for us and our allies:  in the south Denikin's Volunteer Army has already begun their thrust north toward Moscow.  In the east, the Czech rebellion and Kolchak's forces are threatening to overrun the Bolsheviks.  Today presents the best opportunity for us to strike at the Bolshevik capital and to crush the regime.  Our alliance with Yudenich's White movement will serve as a powerful bargaining chip-should Imperial Russian forces emerge victorious in Russia's civil war.

The first objective of the combined force is to secure the important railroad hub at Luga.  15th, 19th, and 11th divisions of the Soviet 15th Army have entrenched along the front.  Intelligence reports the 15th Army posseses 2 armored trains and a division in reserve.  You must capture your objectives as rapidly as possible:  every day the Bolsheviks conscript new masses into the Red Army.
