Battle of Lake Narotch
18 March, 1916

Gospodin General,
As the Battle of Verdun rages on the Western Front, the French military liason office has urgently requested a Russian offensive to begin with the hope of preventing the transfer of divisions from the German Eastern Front to the west.  Our 2nd Army (Ragoza) had begun preparing an offensive aimed at recapturing Wilna and Panevezys.  Here at Lake Narotch you will lead the V and XXXVI Corps (Baluyev Group).  All artillery assets (divisional, corps, and army) have been combined into three artillery groups to facilitate a breakthrough.

The German line (XXI and XXXVIII Res Corps) has been significantly fortified since our engagements here in the fall of 1915.  Expect several layers of entrenchments and concrete fieldworks.  Air reconnaissance has spotted the entire 9th Cavalry Division in reserve of this sector.
