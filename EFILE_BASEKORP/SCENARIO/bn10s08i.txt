
TOBRUK - 10 APR 1941

Western Desert, Libya

Welcome to Africa! The front here is deadlocked and the Italians need our support to reach a victory. Your first task is to expel the Commonwealth troops from Libya. The Italian attack on Egypt last September failed miserably and our allies suffered a heavy defeat and the loss of Tobruk earlier this year. Now Australians have manned this fortress with his important deep-water port. For a long siege of the fortress we lack in time, try to take Tobruk by surprise without stopping motion and open the way to Egypt for us!

GOAL: Take all VH's!

NOTE: All axis nations auxiliaries are under your command.
