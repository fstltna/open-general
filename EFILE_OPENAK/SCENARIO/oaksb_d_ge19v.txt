Superb work, Herr General!  Thanks to your rapid advance across the Meuse, the Allies are in complete disarray.  You have demonstrated the superiority of our tactics over what was once called the world's best army.  We must now push rapidly to the shores of the English Channel and complete the defeat of our enemies.
