Your next mission is to invade England. You must seize London and all other objectives in England before our limited shipping and the storms in the English Channel force us to withdraw our invasion forces. High command has given you until September 30th to complete your mission, but we fear that you must succeed sooner or we will see the invasion falter before the British surrender. Operation Sealion is about to begin. Good Luck!
