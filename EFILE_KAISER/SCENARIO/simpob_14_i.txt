Mousetrap: Ryazan

December 12th, 1919

The Military Directory decided that Denikin's elite troops would lead the frontal attack against Moscow, while Wrangel and Diterikhs flanked them. Other units, including mine, would attack other points of the Bolshevik defensive perimeter, in order to weaken our enemies, prevent them from reinforcing the capital, and blocking as many Red escape routes as possible.

Specifically, our new mission would be the taking of Ryazan and Kolomna, southeast of Moscow.  I was determined to succeed, no matter the cost.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.
