Abárzuza

June 25th, 1874

After our offensive failed we had to retire to our strongholds in Navarra. The republican General Concha has directed his troops there, determined to take our capital, Estella, and defeat us definitely. But this time we are prepared. Gather your army, reject the liberals and recover the local villages.

Victory conditions: Take all the VHs.

Notes: - The unit that takes Abárzuza will win a leader.
            - The unit that enters Lácar will win + 100 pex.
            - From now on the new units that you buy will begin with 120 pex.
