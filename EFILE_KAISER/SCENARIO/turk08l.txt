Raid on Misir - Loss 

Our plan to disrupt the Canal traffic and to liberate Misir has failed due to the enemy superiority. British counterattacks drove us back into the desert, and we have had to start a withdrawal across the Sinai to Beersheba. At the moment we don't have the means to repet the counterattack, so we have to focus on other goals.

Historical outcome:
Soon the task became too hard, because troops from all over the British Empire flooded into the Nile Delta, while the Ottoman Empire could send there only a weak corps. The Ottomans retreated to safer positions in Gaza and Beersheba, although they manteined some advanced outposts on the Siani peninsula.
