CO Admiral William K. Harrill

Our intelligence reports that the Japanese want to strengthen their troops on Leyte to launch an counteroffensive against our landed troops. For this reason, several convoys from Manila toward Ormoc Bay are on their way and more will follow. In the coming weeks you will monitor the bay and the port of Ormoc and intercept and destroy the incoming enemy reinforcements.

Take all VH and destroy the Japanese naval units on their way to Ormoc and prevent any landing attempt. If five enemy unit reach the harbor of Ormoc, your mission failed!


TIP

Note that torpedo bombers must over an ocean hex, to attack an adjacent Naval unit. 


THE STORY

TA-3 and TA-4 Convoy
On 8 November and 9 November, the Japanese dispatched two convoys from Manila to Ormoc Bay. The convoys were spaced one day apart so that the destroyers escorting the first convoy could double back and escort the second. However, the convoys were spotted on November 9 and attacked by land-based aircraft of the Fifth Air Force. On 10 November the 38th Bomb Group, based on Morotai, sent 32 B-25 Mitchells escorted by 37 P-47 Thunderbolts to attack TA-4 near Ponson Island. Reaching the convoy just before noon, the B-25s attacked at minimum altitude in pairs, sinking the two largest transports, disabling a third, and sinking two of the patrol craft escorts, at a cost of seven bombers, for which the group was awarded the Distinguished Unit Citation.

On 11 November U.S. 3rd Fleet commander Admiral William F. Halsey ordered an attack by 350 planes of Task Force 38 on the combined convoys.

Four destroyers - Shimakaze, Wakatsuki, Hamanami and Naganami - and three transports were sunk. Rear Admiral Mikio Hayakawa went down with Shimakaze.

TA-5
Convoy TA-5 left Manila on 23 November for Port Cataingan and Port Balancan. Of the six transports, five were sunk by air attack.
