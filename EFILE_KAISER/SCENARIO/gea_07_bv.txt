Congratulations on a brilliant victory and taking all of your objectives. However, we must abandon Kondoa and retreat further south as we are in danger of being surrounded in the town.

Historic aftermath: The German assault began on May 7, with the German forces advancing and Van Deventer withdrawing to the town itself. Further German assaults meet with a determined defense and were stopped cold. The German forces dug into their positions to the south and held for two more months.  They switched to a tactic of raids on supply columns and artillery barrages on Kondoa
