Operation Zitadelle - July 1943 TV

Congratulations Herr General. You have broken through the first Russian defensive lines. This has however taken far more time than expected. 
After receiving the news of the Allied invasion of Sicily, as well as reports of impeding Soviet attacks on the Mius River and at Izyum, Hitler has decided to cancel Operation Zitadelle.

The Zitadelle scenario is influenced by Jorge Gabitto's Kursk campaign.
