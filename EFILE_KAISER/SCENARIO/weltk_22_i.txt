Closing the trap

May 25th, 1919

After the fall of Dieppe and the evacuation of the British forces, taking Rouen was extremely easy. At this stage the French Navy and a great part of the French Army are in open mutiny and the radicalism amongst the working class soldiery is rising. We've opened a second front  in the south, where our troops stationed in Italy are marching towards Marseille. At last we can say that France is doomed.

However, you'll have to make one last effort before we can completely encircle Paris. There are still some strong enemy units west of the city, blocking the way to Chartres and Orléans. Defeat them and those two towns will fall, too. Then Paris will be surrounded and the French government will have no option but to surrender unconditionally. But be careful, our enemies are desperate and that makes them unpredictable.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.
