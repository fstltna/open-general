THE BATTLE OF GAZALA June 1942 BV

The heroic defence of the Bir Hacheim box by the Free French and the initial shock caused by the 100+ new enemy Grant tanks almost cost us the victory. But in the end we succeeded in beating the enemy armor, dislodging the enemy infantry brigades from their isolated boxes and reaching Tobruk. Too bad that the 1st South African Division and the two remaining brigades of the 50th Division broke out and were able to retreat into Egypt. 

Prepare your division to participate in yet another attempt to capture Tobruk.
