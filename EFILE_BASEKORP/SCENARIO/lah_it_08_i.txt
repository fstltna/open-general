We are closing in on two Soviet armies defending Uman.  If the 17th Army and the 6th Army can link up the Soviets will be encircled and we will have achieved a great victory.  We are still advancing along with Von Kleists armoured group.  You should watch out for Soviet counter-attacks, as they try to break out of our encirclement.
