Kiretch Tepe - 15/08/1915
------------------------------------------
General, we have established a bridgehead at Suvla Bay, but the Turks are still in control of the heights. Right now the enemy might not yet be strong enough for a decisive counter-attack, but our situation is quite uncomfortable, and we should act, until Johnny Turk is able to throw us back into the sea. A first assault on the Kiretch Tepe Ridge has failed three days ago. Not a single soldier of the 1/5th Norfolks battalion has returned from this attack. Now GHQ has decided to mount a final major attack along the same ridge.

Your 29th Division will advance along the ridge, with the 162nd Brigade of the 54th Division moving in protective support along the right flank of the attack. Our main objective is Kidney Hill, the centre of the Turkish defence positions at Kiretch Tepe.

Good luck, General!
