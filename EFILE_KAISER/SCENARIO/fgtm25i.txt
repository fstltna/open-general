Dukla Pass, January 26, 1915
Gospodin General-Leitenant, SW Front (Ivanonv) has commanded we go on the offensive in the Carpathian mountains.  Simultaneously with the NW Front's offensive in North Poland, we will launch the offensive campaign of 1915.  Our strategic goals are to crest the Carpathian mountains and to break out into the Hungarian plains.

The Austrians, on the other side, are desperately trying to break through toward Przemysl.  With over 150,000 troops still fighting inside the fortress, the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Armies continue to mount ferocious attacks.  In command of our XII Corps (Lesh), you will face the Austrian III.Korps (von Geldern), which had retreated from Przemysl into the mountains during the fall of 1914.  Lesh's troops are already veterans of Carpathian fighting -- having briefly taken Dukla in November of 1914.  The Austrian Limanowa offensive, however, had forced his corps to leave Dukla and assist the bulk of the 8th Army to the north.

Dukla Pass holds tremendous value to us as a gateway toward a strategic solution to the conflict with Austria-Hungary:  you must make haste in the face of stubborn enemy resistance and our own ammunition supply problems.
