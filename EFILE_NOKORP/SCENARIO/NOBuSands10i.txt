Bad news, the British troops have been reinforced with a second Corps. They now largely outnumber us, and if this wasn't enough, their planes stationed in Malta are gnawing at our supply lines.
Do what you can now, the situation is going downhill fast.

Anyway. The eastern front has stayed along the line Tobruk - Bir El Gubi, as you left it. It's time to push eastwards and reclaim the rest of the Italian Libyan territory, all the way to Sollum. At least we'll be again where this sorry story started...
Beware, the British had time to dig in. We brought in some heavy artillery you will need.



Instructions: Capture all VHs. You get a free heavy artillery unit.
