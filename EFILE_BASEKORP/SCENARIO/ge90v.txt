Herr Feldmarschall, this triumph is a fitting end to our English campaign.  Once again your skill has led to victory, and more importantly, you have prevented the Americans from using their "Atomic Bomb."  With England and Europe in our grasp, we should be able to negotiate a peace that will give us the Lebensraum we need in Eastern Europe, while withdrawing from England and France.
