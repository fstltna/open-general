10. SERCHIO (25 December 1944)

General, after the great advances of this summer and autumn, the Allied armies and the Germans are locked in a stalemate. The so-called Gothic Line is their new line of defense. Plans are being made for a spring offensive. During the winter many troops will get rested and refitted while others hold the line.

The US 92nd Infantry Division is deployed near the western, Tyrrenic coast in the Serchio River valley. Intelligence suggests the Germans, supported by fascist RSI Italian troops, are about to conduct a tactical offensive. So signs of large reinforcements have been spotted so there is doubt whether this attack will be a full-out offensive. 

Your PEF, now reserve of the US 5th Army, is deployed in the 92nd rear. If the Axis troops attack, you must counterattack and recapture lost positions. If an opportunity comes along to capture even better defensive positions, you have orders to exploit them. Good luck, General!
