Our defeat left the Empire mortally wounded. The coalition forces occupied Tientsin and Peking before the end of the summer, and China had to accept humiliating conditions for peace. My family and I had to flee to the Chinese Turkestan, since the British troops wanted to hang me for high treason. We've lived as farmers since then, under the protection of some loyal army veterans.

China's decadence hasn't stopped. Torn apart by foreign countries, local warlords and revolutionaries, the Dragon still sleeps. I thought that I would see the rebirth of a great nation, but now I know that I'll die before that happens. However, I still hope that one day my grandchildren will be able to live the dream of the Awakening Dragon, the dream that caused their British ancestor to sacrifice everything for the nation that they belong to.
