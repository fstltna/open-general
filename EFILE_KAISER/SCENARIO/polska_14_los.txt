You have missed our best chance to crush Budionny's troops. He has managed to retreat to the east with minor losses and his army will still be a challenge for us in the future. We'll still be able to continue with our counteroffensive but I think that you should resign your command. You performed well in the past, but now you seem exhausted and for the good of our nation you must take a rest.
