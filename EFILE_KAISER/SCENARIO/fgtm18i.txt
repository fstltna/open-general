Jednorozec, March 15, 1915

Gospodin General-Leitenant, fighting along the entire North-Western Front has solidified along deep scars in the ground, called trenches.  Our spring offensive, having been launched following the German failure at Przasnysz, has gained little ground in the area.  Your corps has been called in to capture both German lines of trenches in the vicinity of the town of Jednorozec, just NE of Przasnysz.
