Kokoda Trail

July, 1942

Irasshaimase to New Guinea General. Your troops should be deployed as special detachtment to the South part of this island, to take part in our operations at New Guinea. Our intentions are to cut the supply trails of the enemy from their main base in the South; Port Moresby, which eventually could be further goal, if the enemy is damaged enough.

The axis of the operation, and center objective of our plans, is the village of Kokoda, and its airstrip. If you can take Kokoda, the communications between Port Moresby, and the allied troops on the North of the island would be cut. The airstrip would allow our planes to resupply here, bringing close support to your men. Planes from our base at Rabaul in the North of the island, will arrive to help you.

But, things won't be easy general. The enemy troops deployed here are not a big problem, but as soon as we reach Kokoda, we are sure the Australians will send reinforcements to avoid the fall of his main forward base at New Guinea. Another problem is the jungle with the tropical diseases, and the poor supplies you will receive... anyway we count on you to defeat the enemy one time more, here.
