Gospodin Polkovnik, your tactical prowess has frustrated the Japanese commanders yet again.  The whithering machine-gun fire from your defensive positions has stopped the initial attacking waves in a bloody heap, but the Japanese have pulled up massive reinforcements and are about to overwhelm your positions.

You are to retreat into Port Arthur and preprare for the siege.  Your command has been transferred to General Kuropatkin's newly forming Army Group in Siberia.  The aim is to relieve the siege of Port Arthur by a land campaign from the Russian Far East.

Your efforts thus far are being rewarded with a divisional command and the rank of General-Major!
