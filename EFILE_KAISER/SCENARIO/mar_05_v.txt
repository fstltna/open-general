Message from General Berenguer Fusté's HQ:

Finally we have entered in Xauen, the town that the Berbers thought would never be conquered! El Raisuli has fled to Tazarut, on the last mountanious region that he still holds. He can't recieve reinforcements or supplies, so he won't be able to resist there for a long time. His only option is surrender and accept the rule of the Sultan of Morocco and the Spanish Protectorate. Sooner or later he'll realise that.

As for you, General, your next destination will be the town of Melilla. Your former superior, General Fernández Silvestre, is going to launch an offensive for pacifying the Rif mountains, and has personally asked for your presence there. Good luck!
