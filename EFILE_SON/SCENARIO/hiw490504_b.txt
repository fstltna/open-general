Brilliant, Citoyen General! You have liberated our capital in style. Your name will remain a legend among your colleagues for many years to come. The imperials tried to bombard the young city, Pest, but the heroism of the dismounted hussars has saved the eastern bank of the Danube. I hope this war has now come to a glorious end.

NOTE: You have got notable prestige award last time. Spend it carefully. 22-23 core units should be enough to win the campaign. The rest of the campaign consists of defensive scenarios, the prestige awards are limited, and even the cap will decrease.
