The Collapse
(October 24, 1918)

General -- the Italian Army, supported by other Entente divisions, has launched a major offensive and crossed the Piave. This war is lost. There are rumors about Charles IV abdicating any minute and the declaration of an independent Hungary. Probably we are fighting for a country that no longer exists.

However, there is yet one goal to achieve: we must prevent being captured and stuck in internment camps, as an independent Hungary would be attacked by Serbs, Romanians and Czechs. Only the old, the young, the injured and inexperienced reservists are stationed in Hungary.

Most of the soldiers remaining on the Italian front are starving, aimless, without hope very close to deserting like almost all of the Slavic soldiers already did. Your division is one of the very last combat-ready formations. Your job is to cover our retreat before it becomes complete chaos. General, save the life of your comrades and the reputation of the Hungarian hussars.

ORDER: Keep your MSU alive, withdraw 7 units to the Escape Hex and hold at least one VH.

NOTE: Don't try to defend the Piave-line with your core but start the retreat immediately if you don't want to be encircled.
