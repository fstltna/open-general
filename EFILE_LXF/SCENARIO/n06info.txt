CHONGJU (27 October 1950)

Great news, Comrade General.  The warnings given by the Chinese premier Zhou Enlai did not turn the stupid capitalist armies.  Now the people of China will support its Korean comrades in the struggle against capitalism.  Our armies have been allowed to reorganize in Manchuria and for days the Chinese have massed forces just across the Yalu waiting for the right moment to launch a counteroffensive!

Meanwhile we must resist the capitalist advance as long as possible.  This task will be easier with each passing sunrise as the Americans and their South Korean slaves have serious supply problems.   Your force has retreated to Chongju near the Yalu River which is the border with Chinese Manchuria.  You will defend this city and the vicinity against any attacks and if possible advance to pave the way for our Chinese comrades to assemble for a counteroffensive!   We must not let the enemy reach the Yalu River!
