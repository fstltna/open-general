Ukraine

Part 2/3 of the "Ostfront" minicampaign


There are strong concentrations of enemy forces around our objectives and they are moving towards our positions. Seems like the Soviets started another counterattack. Reconnaissance reports around a hundred armoured vehicles including the heavy tanks, most of them in the southern sector around the highway.

Enemy air activity is also very severe! Russians have sent anything possible and our pilots had very difficult times.




Victory conditions: Capture all VHs.

Hint: There are mobile forces moving towards our base. Be careful, precise and cunning.
