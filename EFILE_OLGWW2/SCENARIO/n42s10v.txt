General,

This is a very important victory, though we lost further south, and your position has thus become untennable, we are giving the allies the impression that the road to Germany is still very long. The downside of things is that in the east we had to retreat to the Weichsel and the Prut. 

Meanwhile it has become quite clear that England is no longer a great power. They are bound hand and feet to the Americans, that still insist on an unconditional surrender.
