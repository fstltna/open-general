Succeeding in capturing Przasnysz, the Germans were stopped with severe casualties from advancing further.  Litvinov, forced by a directive from his superior at the North-Western Front (Ruszky), redeployed the I Siberian Corps (Pleshkov) to attack Przasnysz from the south and turned the I Turkestan Corps toward the north.  Ruszky dispatched the II Siberian Corps (Sychevsky) from 12th Army to advance on Przasnysz from the east.  The three corps converged on their objective, defeating the German troops.  The German retreat, however, was not exploited by the Russians:  failing to deploy his cavalry forward, Litvinov missed the opportunity.  In addition, Ruszky failed to subordinate the I Siberian Corps to Litvinov, preventing the two Siberian corps from effective co-ordination.

Overall, the February Przasnysz Operation strengthened the Russian position, while weakening the German.  Strategically, it relieved the pressure on the Russian Warsaw salient and frustrated German plans for a decisive action in the east during the month of February.
