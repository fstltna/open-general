The Hungarian word literally means “National Guard”.

It is a Militia Infantry with weak attack and defense values. It has only two minor special skills: it can use rail transport (RTP) and no station is needed to embark/disembark RTP.

After the success of the revolution in March 1848, the Parliament and the king accepted and announced the “April Laws”, which became the first modern constitution of Hungary. It guaranteed almost a complete independence within a loose personal union with the Austrian Empire, but there were some unsolved questions, like the Hungarian Army responsible only to the Government, as the Hungarians demanded. Until this issue was arranged, the Government wanted some sort of armed forces, which could be used against the Serbian uprising in the southern regions (Bánát).

The National Guard was raised in April 1848. All kind of people volunteered to join: peasants, workers of the manufactures, the university youth, etc. They were enthusiastic but they had very limited military experience. In October 31, 1848, the most Nemzetõrs in the Battle of Schwechat ran away after the first shots of the Austrian cannons. However, the Nemzetõrs figthing in the Bánát gained experience as the war continued, and they became the most valuable troops of the Hungarian Army in the glorious Spring Offensive in April 1849.

In that times the Hungarian cities had significant ethnic German inhabitants, most of them connected to Germany, not Austria. They also joined the Nemzetõrség. According to an annecdote, when Windisch-Grätz occupied Buda, an ethnic Hungarian soldier declared the disband of the local National Guard in front of the captured Nemzetõrs, but they didn’t understand the declaration, because nobody spoke Hungarian amongst them.
