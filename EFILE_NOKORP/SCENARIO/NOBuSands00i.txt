Generalmajor, you are to leave for North Africa immediately.
The British have decided to chase our allies the Italians out of Africa, and we can't allow that. High Command is preparing to send a large force to support the Italians, but it will take some weeks to prepare and move.
In the meantime you are to take your Panzer regiment and do the best you can to limit the damage.

Intelligence has it that the British are about to attack Fort Capuzzo at the Italian frontier with Egypt. It is lightly defended, and our Italian friends' material isn't up to the task, so expect to do most of the work yourself. Good luck, Generalmajor.



Instructions: Repel the British assault. You command both the Italians and your German core units.
