Roterturmpass - September, 1916 - V

My utmost admiration, Oberstleutnant, this has been example of moutain warfare that will probably be taught at military academies in the future. Your daring men took the mountain pass and ferociously defended it against an enemy that was superior in numbers, but lacked the skills and the morale of the Alpenkorps. You not only blocked any reinforcements coming over the Carpathians, but also trapped the retreating, or should  I rather say fleeing, Romanians, flooding back from Hermannstadt after our breakthrough. The enemy has been thoroughly defeated, and Transylvania has been liberated!
