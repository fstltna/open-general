10. CORSICA (12 November 1942)

TO: Admiral
SUBJECT: Operation Kamelie

---The British and Americans have invaded Vichy French North Africa. Because of likely collapse of the French forces, it is even likely that they will join the Allies, the German and Italian armed forces will occupy strategic French positions, including the French mainland, Tunisia and the vital island of Corsica, close to the Italian mainland.

The occupation of Corsica will be performed by parts of your flotilla and your Marine Corps. Some Italian units will support you. It is not certain how the Vichy French forces on Corsica will react but the garrison has some veteran units. Expect the worse. However, no enemy ships should be around which means the guns of your ships can once again be turned inland!---
