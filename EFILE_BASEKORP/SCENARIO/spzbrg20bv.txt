"My beloved,

I wish that you were here with me. It's so long since I have seen you for the last time. I really miss you.

Otto, when you'll talk with Fuhrer, ask him something. Ask him if my daughter really had to die in pain. Ask him if my son had to die on some alien island. Ask him why parson Johann vanished in a KL. Ask him... or not. Maybe don't do anything, just return to me.

Ich liebe dich.

Pauline.

PS: Otto, several times I've asked you for something, but you always forget. The picture you've sent me is awful and the photographer must have been totally inept, because you look like if you have your ear missing. Send me some better photo, please. Viele Küsse..."
