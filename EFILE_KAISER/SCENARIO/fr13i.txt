The First World War - Verdun - The Great French Counter-Attack - October 20th, 1916

Ma chère Fabienne,

I know that I left home too soon, but la France needs me. Our haut-commandement is determined to beat back the Germans at Verdun once and for all. This attack has been prepared very carefully. A lot of guns and ammunition have been moved up to Verdun. Inlcuding two 400mm Creusot-Schneider railway guns. Reconnaisance airplanes have located many German guns. That will give our artillery something to shoot at. Fresh and well-trained troops will move forward behind a creeping barrage. My division will spearhead the attack to regain control of the fortresses of Vaux and Douamont. It will be a glorious day for France when the tricolore flies above those fortresses again.

Je t'embrasse,

Jean-Babtiste.
