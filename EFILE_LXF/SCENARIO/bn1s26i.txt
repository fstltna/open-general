General, you know, the stubborn Americans did not want to agree peace. So now, after months, the preparations are final for the invasion of the USA. The first landing takes place at Portsmouth in New Hampshire, close to Boston. Your air landing troops start from Newfoundland and will form the bridgehead for the following troops. We count on strong resistance and the intervention of the US Navy. Good luck, General!
