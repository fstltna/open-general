In less than an hour Sorendrup and most of his men were dead on the battlefield. Those were the lucky ones. The Ethiopians celebrated the victory murdering and mutilating most of the prisoners. It was impossible not to be moved by the sight of those poor Egyptians castrated, burned, stoned, clubbed, pierced with lances, stripped and violated with the most hideous indignities.

That terrible treatment of the captured enemies was a savage, but widespread tradition in Ethiopia. It was tolerated by Yohannes, and Alula actually encouraged it. As an European, I was horrified by this demonstration of barbarism. If they wished to be regarded as modern soldiers, and not as a bunch of killers, no better than vermin, the Ethiopians would have to improve their morals in addition to their bodies and minds. In the following years I tried to eradicate those despicable practices in the units that I commanded, although I must admit that I only had a partial success. The mistreatment of prisoners became gradually uncommon, but it never disappeared completely.

After the battle, the Egyptians retreated to their bases in the Red Sea coast, leaving much of their equipment behind. That allowed us to acquire hundreds of rifles, as well as a handful of cannons, which would be very useful in the future. However, our enemies had vowed to return with a larger force as soon as they could, and avenge their defeat at Gundet.

John Kirkham arrived too late in Gundet, so he didn't take part in the battle. Some weeks later Yohannes sent him again as an emissary to London, but this time he was captured by the Egyptians. Showing that they were no better that the Ethiopians, the Egyptians tortured him for months, until he finally died, broken and sick.
