Kongratulieren! The Soviets have been kicked out of Persia, and the British Armies will no longer disturb us here. The Middle East is under our command as well as the oil resources from these lands. In spite of the failure at Stalingrad, our presence in Persia will put pressure on  the Soviet southern borders. We hope the Kursk offensive will be a decisive victory for the Werhmacht, helped now by our big oil supplies...

(You have managed the DAK better than Rommel! Congratulations General!)
