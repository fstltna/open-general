Sweden was always particularly friendly to us, the Swedes even gave us information about the British attempts to crack our coding system, but someone - we suspect the Russians and the Americans - has been fueling anti-German sentiment in the armed forces and there has been a rebellion. The Swedish government has screamed for help. I think we can send nobody better than you - relieve Stockholm and rescue the Swedish government!
