All that stands between us and victory in the west is a quick knock-out blow against the disorganized allied armies in France. Your mission is to break the French 'will to resist' by taking Paris and all other objectives by no later than July 30th. However, due to the difficulties involved in preparing for an invasion of England, it is essential that you end this campaign much sooner if at all possible. Otherwise, the opportunity to invade England this summer will be lost. The upcoming battle for France is the most important campaign you have yet to participate in.
