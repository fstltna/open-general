Tula Counterattack
Now it is time to take the initiative. You are facing the 2. Panzerarmee, which will attack every moment your lines south of Tula. Hold Tula and try to realize a counterattack if possible.
Your troops:
You have the command about the 49. and 50. Army. The troops are still inexperienced, but they were reinforced only just. 
We are pleased to tell you, that we have decided to add a new recon unit to your troops.
Enemy troops:
Parts of the 2. Panzerarmee are under the required strength. There are not so much tanks and anti-tanks on the first front line, however the 2. Panzerarmee still have some tank divisions in reserve. Probably the Germans will march them off.
Please notice:
A brilliant victory, a normal victory and a tactical victory will lead to different scenarios. There will be no choice scenario. You should make a save game, if you want to play all scenarios.
A brilliant victory will give you the opportunity to end the war in the early 1942 by encircling the Heeresgruppe Mitte at Krasny Bor.
A normal victory will lead you to the normal progression of the campaign. 
If you achieve only a tactical victory or a loss you have to defend Moskau first, before you can continue with the normal campaign path (Demyansk).
