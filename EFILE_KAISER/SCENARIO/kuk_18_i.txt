Unternehmen Radowitz (I): Verona

Jun 15th, 1918

Here we are, south of Trient. Our aim is to break through the Italian lines while the Entente armies are still fighting in Greece, before they can react effectively. 

Underestimating the Italians after the battle of Karfreit would be a great mistake, though. They've put into practice a strategy of defence in depth, so moving on the mountain terrain may become difficult. If you're not careful, your casualties can be high.

Nevertheless, we think that a combination of mountain units and sturmtruppen should be able to open a gap in the Italian positions near the river Etsch, where the Italian 1st army is staying. Then they could take Verona. At the same time, our infantry will assault the positions of the 6th Italian army, which is deployed south of Asiago. It has been reinforced with some French and British divisions, so an attack there will probably advance quite slowly, but we have to try. If we're lucky, we could occupy Vicenza, too. Then, with both towns in our hands, the invasion of Italy could start. Good luck, General!

Victory conditions:
