Everstiluutnantti,
I have to tell you that the war is over. Our casualties were so high in the end that the government has sued for peace negotiations. You are the main reason that we don't face the Soviets as losers. I shall extend to you Field Marshall Mannerheims deep appreciation for a job well done.
The war is over for now, but we have shown to the world that a tiny nation can accomplish unusual things in the struggle for freedom. Due to our superior tactics and great skills of war; we have exposed the deficiencies of the Red Army. At least no one can say we didn't fight bravely.

Here and now I predict that we will face the Soviets again in the not so distant future.
