Choice

February 8th, 1900

Due to your brilliant victory at Colesberg, now you may decide the course of the campaign. You can go to Paardeberg in order to save Cronjé's army, or you can stay at Colesberg.

If you stay, Cronjé will surrender at Paardeberg and you'll follow a historical path. You'll play battles that actually took place in real life, fighting until the bitter end. No matter how well you perform, you'll eventually lose your core and will have to rebuild it, and you'll have to surrender to the British in 1902. The scenarios will become short, guerrilla-like skirmishes. 
On the other hand, that's what really happened.

If you choose to help Cronjé you'll have a chance to defeat Roberts and change history. You'll play fictional scenarios that could end with a surprising Boer victory. It will be nicer, but just a dream.

Now it's time to make your decision.

Choice conditions:
- If you choose the historical path take the Boer flag.
- If you choose the fictional path choose the British flag.
