Battle for Henderson Field

October, 1942

The situation is not good.  The Americans have launched a counterattack defeating our Eastern positions and also our positions on the hills southwards to Tenaru.  Although the enemy forces are besieged, the initial landings are being supported by many additional navy and air units, plus some reinforcements. Also, they have fortified their positions, and the battle will be bloody...  Your main objective is to capture ''Henderson Field'', the airstrip from which the enemy has been receiving supplies to maintain the beach head. Your command is now attached to the 17th Army.  The Imperial Navy is here to engage the American Navy, let's see what our ships can achieve against the enemy vessels.

Good luck.
