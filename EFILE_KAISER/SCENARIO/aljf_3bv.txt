The decisive Battle at Waghäusel * BV

Lieber Freund,
we've fought very brave, but the Prussians sent more and more troops against us... at last our front collapsed.... 
All our men, who have not been killed or captured, flew to Switzerland and most of us want to emigrate to the USA... there, we can live in liberty....
