Çatalca line

November 17th, 1912

Here we are, only 25 miles away from Tsarigrad. Behind our lines, the Ottomans still resist at Odrin, but they are being beseiged by our Second Army and some Serbian divisions. Thus, only the defences of the Çatalca line prevent us from entering in the old capital of the Bizantine Empire.
Although somewhat outdated, the Çatalca line is still a formidable fortress. Behind its fortifications and trenches, the Ottomans have gathered all their remaining forces in Europe, they have brought their artillery together for centralized operations, and besides they are expecting some reserve divisions from Anatolia. There aren't any obvious weak points in the line, so by no means should you underestimate the enemy.
Our High Command suggest that you should make a general frontal attack with our frontline divisions, but it might be wiser to focus our attacks at some specific points, in order to open breaches in the enemy defences. And don't hesitate to use our own reserve units.

Victory conditions: Take all VHs.

Special note: Even if you lose this scenario, the campaign will go on.
