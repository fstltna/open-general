Here at the port of Gibraltar, the Allied dogs have made their final stand in continental Europe. It is up to you, comrade General, to expel them from their hiding spot.  

The Allies have sent their best troops to hold their fortress, and are heavily dug in. Additionally, the Royal Navy is patrolling the narrow waters around Gibraltar.

Intelligence has intercepted an Allied radio transmission; it is possible the Allies may try to send troops from their North African colonies in desperation, in an effort to reinforce their garrison on Gibraltar.  

The party is relying on a victory from you here comrade; show the Allies why it is futile to resist Soviet supremacy!
