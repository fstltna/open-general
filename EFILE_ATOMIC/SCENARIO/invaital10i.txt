Orders:

The allied advance on mainland Italy is already past the Island of Elba. We don't need a german stronghold in our back, just off the coast! 
You will command a small allied special force in order to capture Elba and fight down the german garrison.

Note:

Most of your units are still engaged on the mainland and you can deploy only few core units.
You should depoly your ships and infantry or other light units like mortars and MGs only.

You can not deploy your planes in this scenario. You can not build or repair facilities/hex.
