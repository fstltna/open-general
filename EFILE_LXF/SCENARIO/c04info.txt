04. PRAGUE (3 November 1938)

Victory lies at our feet, General! Our new plan has worked and we are in the rear of the Czech forces. Even more we have cut off Slovakia, and thus the 3rd Czech Army, from the main part of the Czech Army in Bohemia in the west. We have formed a huge Kessel, though with some gaps here and there, around Prague. 

While 8th Army is storming to Prague from the north west, your men must attack Prague from behind. Not much opposition is expected but be aware of retreating Czechs that try to reach and defend their capital. 

We know that the Czechs have an elite division, formed and trained to defend Prague and its defenses. Be aware, we are not sure if this division is still an elite force, because it could have been used as manpower reserve. Elements of 44th Infantry and 29th Motorized Infantry Divisions will support you.
