Battle of Kirk Kilisse - victory

Excellent! You have rendered the Bulgarian 3rd Army nearly useless. However, the center of our line and our left flank haven't been so successful. We'll have to retreat to the safety of the Çatalca line, but at least we'll make it orderly and with low casualties. The Bulgarians won't dare to chase us for some time.

Historical outcome
Kirk Kilisse was an outstanding victory for Bulgaria. Although initially well planned, the Ottoman counterattack was poorly executed, giving the Bulgarian 3rd Army time for deploying its reserves and launching a frontal attack on the Turkish lines. After some heavy fighting the Ottomans were defeated and fled the battlefield, leaving much of their equipment to the victorious Bulgarians.
