00. BZURA (15 September 1939)

To the commanding officer of Infanterie Regiment 16:

War has broken out. Germany is in war with Great Britain, France and Poland. The Heer has been split in two and a large force is guarding the western borders. The other part is invading Poland. 

You have been commanding IR-16 for several years now and has always been under the command of 22. Infanterie Division which is deployed at the Westwall. For the operation in Poland, however, IR-16 is assigned as reserve unit for Heeresgruppe Sud and after two weeks of sitting idle it is assigned to combat duty.

A large number of Polish troops are encircled in a pocket west of Warschau. These entrapped troops are trying to break out and reinforce their capitol. North of your sector heavy fights along the Bzura River have started. It is essential that the pocket is crushed as soon as possible.

IR-16 will attack from Mystkowica, cross the Bzura River and converge with the regiments on your flank on Rzasno. The Polish are presumed to merely holding the line along the Bzura River to let their comrades further north, escape to Warsaw. Good luck, Oberst!

RULES: 
- Do not upgrade, sell or buy units - nor upgrading transports.
- Replacing lost units by buying new units is allowed. Replacements should be the exact same unit as the lost unit.

NOTE: The rest of 22. Infanterie Division is also on the map but is restricted from moving and fighting.
