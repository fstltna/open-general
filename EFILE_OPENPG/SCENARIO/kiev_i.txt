For weeks our troops have been stopped by Russian forces near Kiev. It is time for you to encircle and destroy their positions. You are hereby ordered to strike south toward Kiev and Lokhvitsa. Army Group South units, temporarily under your command, are to drive north and meet your forces, thus encircling the Russian armies. All of the objectives in your sector must be taken by September 19th in order for us to redeploy your troops in time for an attack on Moscow this year. An earlier completion of this battle can only enhance your prestige, and give you a better chance to obtain the resources you will need to capture Moscow.
