Operation Lila - November 1942 V

You could not prevent the scuttling of a large part of the Vichy French fleet. Mussolini will have to do with less ships than he had hoped for.

Prepare your forces for a move to the Eastern front. The Bolsheviks have started a winter offensive that must be stopped by the complete SS Panzer Corps.

HISTORY
- The French scuttled most (73 ships) of their fleet. Only few would be salvaged and used by the Axis.
- SS Panzer-Grenadier Divisions LSSAH, Das Reich and Totenkopf - forming the SS Panzer Corps - were sent to the Eastern front to stop the Russians advancing after their victory at Stalingrad.
