Our defence strategy didn't work. I guess that, no matter what we had tried, it wouldn't have been enough to delay the Soviets, much less to stop them. We were lucky to save our lives and to avoid capture, but we had to leave tons of equipment and ammunition behind. The victorious Bolsheviks found a great treasure in Ufa. Much more that they had expected.
