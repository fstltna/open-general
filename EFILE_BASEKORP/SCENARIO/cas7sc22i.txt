Welcome back to the Balkans, my friend. Turkey has for a long time been regarded as a country closer to us than to the enemy. They showed their will to cooperate during the Iraq crisis, but now they seem to be shying away from the obvious next step - signing an alliance with us and Tokyo. We'll have to persuade them. Your task is to push through the Turkish border fortifications and occupy Edime, Lueleburgaz and Corlu - that will give us a direct path to Istanbul and force the Turks to ally with us.
