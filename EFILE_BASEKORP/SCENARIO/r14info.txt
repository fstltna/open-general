14. MAIKOP (10 January 1943)

We have had victories these last months, comrade! We have trapped hundreds of thousands fascist near Stalingrad where our forces are still feriously resisting the enemy. And in the Caucasus the Germans are slowly retreating. We started our winter offensive to liberate the Caucasus region all the way up to Novorossiysk and Rostov, some weeks ago. Your forces have been held in reserve but will now be deployed in order to recapture Maikop and hopefully cut off enemy forces. The fascist can only retreat west, to Novorossiysk and the Taman/Kuban peninsula, or north-west to Rostov. With the capture of Maikop we can force the fascist forces to take the longer way, to Rostov, where they should be met by our own forces coming from the Don. 

Your goal is to recapture Maikop and the oilfields, as well as an advance to the Kuban River. The Germans are retreating but do this skillful. And the more west you will arrive, the more tenacious the fascist defenses will become. So be careful. Good luck, comrade!
