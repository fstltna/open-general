07. Normandy - Operation Goodwood - The death ride of the armoured divisions LOSS

Herr Major, that was a poor performance. The British 3rd Infantry Division and the 5th Guards Armoured Brigade made substantial advances in your sector. Luckily on your left, on Bourguébus Ridge, 1SS LSSAH stopped the advance of 7th and 11th Armoured Divisions and the remainder of the Guards Armoured Division.

Your schwere Panzer Abteilung will stay in this sector of the front.

HISTORY
Operation Goodwood was one of the largest tank battles the British ever fought. Monty assembled three Armoured Divisions - in total about 1100 tanks. Preceded by heavy aerial bombardments but without much infantry support these divisions tried to capture Bourguébus Ridge. They did advance seven miles and destroyed close to 100 German tanks. But the failed to capture the ridge and lost over 300 tanks. What they did achieve was pinning German troops that could not disengage to counterattack against the US Operation Cobra.
