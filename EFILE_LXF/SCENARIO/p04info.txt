04. HARAR (16 March 1941)

After the initial success at Mogadishu, the Southern Force has advanced into Ethiopia. The Northern Force has just gained victory after a fierce battle at Keren. Both Forces are heading for the Ethiopian capitol of Addis Adeba. 

On the way to Addis Adeba, a pass between two mountain ranges exists with a vital road in it. In order to keep up supplies and a steady advance this road will have to be taken. The Italians are known to be occupying the settlement of Harer near the road. The enemy has not been fighting intensely lately and it seems the Italians are retreating deeper into Ethiopia - although it seems the Italians are close to surrendering. However there is no doubt that there is a rearguard at Harar. Your PEF, assisted by East African units will advance through Harar and clear the road! Good luck, General!
