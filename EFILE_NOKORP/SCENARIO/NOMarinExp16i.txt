This is an important industrial center, and your task is to destroy the key installations.
While the US resistance does indeed seem stronger than last year, we don't believe you will encounter too much of an opposition. We expect the Americans to have sent all their best troops and equipment to the Pacific, leaving only second-rate troops and obsolete equipment here.


Instructions: Destroy the enemy MSUs. (They are also VHs, making them easier to spot.)
