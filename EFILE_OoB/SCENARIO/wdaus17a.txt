Situation report: The war is now definitely winding down for the enemy. The Americans are island-hopping closer and closer to Japan and MacArthur is firmly entrenched in the Phillipines. Now it is a matter of simply mopping up. Our job will be to clear the Japanese off some of the areas that were left behind in the American advance.

Operational orders: You are to begin a major assault to the south of Tarakan, specifically in the area of Balikpapan, on the eastern coast of Borneo. The enemy has many troops in the area and they are spoiling for a fight. We expect fanatical opposition, as the Japanese have begun using Kamikaze attacks in every theater of operation and their soldiers have become more inclined to suicidal banzai charges than standard assaults. Your first task will be to capture the port of Balikpapan.
Do not attempt to move your assault to the North. Powerful fleet units of the Japanese Navy are in the vicinity of Samarinda and only a minefield stands between them and your forces. It is imperative that you capture the port before the Japanese Fleet can make its way through the minefield!
