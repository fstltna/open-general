"The holy religion of our parents is persecuted, the good are oppressed, immorality is honoured, anarchy is triumphant, the public finances are sacked, the credit is lost, the property is threatened, the industry is lifeless ... If things continue like this, the poor people will be left without bread and Spain without honour. Our parents would not have endured so much, let's be worthy of our parents. For our God, for our country and your King, arise, Spaniards".

Carlos VII, April 21st 1872
