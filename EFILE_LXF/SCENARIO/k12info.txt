12. LEROS (11 November 1943)

TO: Generaladmiral
SUBJECT: Occupation of Leros

---In September Italy has betrayed us and surrendered to the Allies. However the Army was able to occupy Italy and the Italian occupation zones before the Allies could make use of the situation. In the Aegian Sea, however, there are still a number of Greek islands under Italian control. Leros is one of them, and British forces have landed on it. This cannot be tolerated so we will capture Leros!

The Italian garrison has joined the British Expedionary Force. Leros poses a serious fortification and the British Royal Navy is also present. Your Marine Corps is once again the German main force. You will be supported by the Luftwaffe and Fallschirmjaeger.---

NOTE: You will not be able to deploy naval units in this scenario. You can deploy ground units but you will have manually to embark them on the "Port Embarking Hexes" near your supplyhex.
