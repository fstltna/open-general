BRILLANT VICTORY

That was the famous Walwal crisis that was to set as they say, or said the chancelleries of Europe alight.

Walwal was only a frontier incident. It was admittedly a serious incident but there had been other serious frontier incidents.

Admittedly if the gamble had succeeded and Italy had backed down, Ethiopia would have gained an important asset: the definition of all her frontiers. But if the gamble went wrong, as it did go wrong, the risks were very great. In fact the gamble was only justified if the Ethiopians were convinced at the time that Mussolini meant war. If he did, they had nothing to lose and possibly everything to gain by creating a crisis in Europe.

It would be ridiculous to explain a war merely on the grounds of a dictator's psychology. The causes of the Italo-Ethiopian war lay in history; the pretext was a minor frontier incident; but the timing can only be explained by the working of Mussolini's imagination.
