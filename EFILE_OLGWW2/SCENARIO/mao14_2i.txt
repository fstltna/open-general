Pusan Revisited

27-6-1951 Pusan, South Korea

Just like last year, the UN forces are again encircled on the ''Pusan Perimeter''.  Now, with the bulk of the North Korean forces are guarding the rear, we can assault the enemy positions without the fear of an assault on our back like last years landings at Inch'on.

You have one mission; destroy the remnants of the capitalist forces.  Otherwise, they will receive more reinforcements and support from their stronghold at Pusan.  Quick drive them into the sea and Korea will become the unified Korean People's Republic.
