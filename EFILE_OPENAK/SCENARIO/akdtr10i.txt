Ja Wolfgang, I was as surprised as you that they chose Normandy.... Ah, Herr General, come in. Allow me to explain the present situation. We have a chance to drive the Allies back into the sea, here, near Caen. I will not pretend that this will be an easy task, but you have shown yourself to be a most resourceful fellow time and time again, ja? You will need all your skill to wrest a victory here. Our thoughts are with you.

One complicating factor that you must be aware of is that the Allies are attacking us with air units based in the British Isles.  Unfortunately there is nothing we can do to attack these air bases at this time.  Our rockets are not accurate enough, yet.  The Luftwaffe will have to defeat the Allied air forces in French air space to gain air supremacy over the battlefield.
