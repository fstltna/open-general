Battle for the Grebbelinie - May 1940

With the Polish problem solved, we are now looking at the West: The Netherlands, Belgium and France. 
Your command has switched from SS Regiment Deutschland to SS Regiment Der Fuehrer which is attached to the 207th ID. This division will cross the border with the help of two armoured trains, break through the Grebbe Defensive Line and capture the city of Utrecht in the heart of the Netherlands.

PLAYER ORDERS
- Capture all Victory hexes.
- No new units can be purchased before or during during the scenario.
- Units can be upgraded before the scenario.
- Strength lost on core units will not be automatically replaced at HQ at the start of the next scenario, as your troops will be required to continue to operate in the Netherlands.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
- The whole of the 207th ID and the units attached to it will follow your advance into the Netherlands.
- No Luftwaffe units have orders to provide air support to your troops, but fighter units supporting air landings around The Hague and Rotterdam might come to your assistence as they pass through the area.
