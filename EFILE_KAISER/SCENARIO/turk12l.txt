Supporting the allies: Kobadin - loss

You've done your best, but the enemy defences were too strong. Never mind. Now take a well-deserved rest with your troops. We'll send fresh units to the battle as soon as possible. In a few weeks Kobadin will be taken, and after that the port of Köstence and the railway between that city and Bogazköy will fall easily. Romania will be defeated before the end of this year.

Historical outcome
The initial attack against the Rasova- Kobadin-Tuzla line failed. It wasn't until October 25th when the Central Powers could finally overcome the Russo-Romanian resistance and take Köstence (Constanta). However, in general, the Romanian campaign was a success. The menace against Hungary was quickly thwarted, and most of Romania was quickly occupied by Germany and her allies. Bucharest fell on December 6th, and the surviving Romanian units had to flee to Iasi, where they managed to reorganize themselves and continue the fighting. But eventually, with the final defeat and surrender of Russia in 1918, Romania had to ask for peace.
