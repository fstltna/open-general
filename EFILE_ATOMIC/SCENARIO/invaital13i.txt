Orders:

Sir, we are about to launch our spring offensive in the next days. But before you should pick your best men and carry out a commando operation. We need to secure our right flank at the Adriatic Sea. You and your men, alongside British Commandos, are ordered to capture the sandspit which is seperating the Comacchio Lagoon from the Sea. The germans have entrenched on the spit.

Note:

You should deploy light units only (infantry, mortars, light artillery and MGs).
