At Neuve Chapelle - March 12th 1915 - TV

General. You have disappointed Falkenhayn. The British attack was a success and it remains a mystery why the enemy did not exploit this victory .

Historical events:
The battle at Neuve Chapelle served mostly political gains. Conquering the village had no military significance whatsoever. 

Lord Kitchener wanted to wait with a major British military offensive until his new volunteer army was ready - in 1916 or even 1917. By that time the Russians and French would be exhausted, it would be Britain that would gain the victory and could set conditions at the negotiating table, without having to take its allies into account. In the mean time, gains were to be had at Gallipoli (starting April 1915).

The Commander of British forces in France, sir John French however wanted to prove his superiors that the BEF was capable of forcing a decisive breakthrough and that the Gallipoli campaign was a waste of resources. He also wanted to demonstrate the fighting force of the BEF to his French colleagues. The French at that point did not think highly of the BEF that only held 40km of the 750km front line.

Sir Douglas Haigh of the First British Army was able to convince sir John French to let him carry out the attack - and not sir Horace Smith-Dorrien - by promising a real break-through at Neuve Chapelle towards Lille and la Bassee. The commander of [IV] Corps Rawlinson had a more limited attack in mind with the goal of straightening the front line and capturing Neuve Chapelle - nothing more than that. Not the last of the differences of opinion between Haig and his generals. When the attack began, Rawlinson had not made any plans for exploiting a breakthrough. Simply because he was convinced that there would be none.

Preparations for the attack stayed undetected by the Germans. The British superiority in infantry numbers was enormous - 48 battalions of the [IV] and [Indian] Corps against 3 German battalions. The British had 530 guns and howitzers at the 2km front line. 

Historical events:

- March 10 7:00am: Opening bombardment.
- March 10 8:15am: First German trench line occupied
- March 10 8:50am: Second wave troops follow up the attack and occupy next trench line that turns out to be undefended. Because of a scheduled - but useless - British bombardment on that trench line, the troops have to retreat, after which they could re-occupy the trench. Permission to continue attacking was refused.
- March 10 1:00pm: All goals of the first phaze reached. Germans concentrate on a few strong points and bring in reinforcements.
- March 10 3:30pm: Artillery bombardment that starts 2nd phase hits own troops and disorganized attacks fail to reach goals.
- March 12 evening: German reinforcements (6th Bavarian Reserve Division and elements 13th and 14th Infanterie divisions) stabilize front.
- March 13: Two more British attacks fail after a failed artillery barrage.
- March 14 sunrise: German counterattack failed - mainly because of insufficient artillery support.

The Bristish gained about 1km over a 2km front at the expense of 11,652 killed. German casualties were 8,600. Mainly because of Falkenhayn's insistence that all terrain lost had to be regained.
