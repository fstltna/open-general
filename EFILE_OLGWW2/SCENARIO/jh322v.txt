You have dealt the Red Army a severe blow. With our line shortened, we will be able to transfer some troops to Feldmarschall von Paulus at Stalingrad. Good work, Herr General.  Meanwhile the Finns are opening a drive to recover the land they lost to the Bolsheviks in 1940.  Remembering your help in 1939 the Finns have specifically asked for you to lead their drive.  The General Staff has agreed to their request, so you and your men are to transfer North after a short period for rest and refitting.
