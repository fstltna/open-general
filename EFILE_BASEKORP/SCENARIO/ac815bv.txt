Welcome General, a Toast!?!

Your liberation of Basarabia was brilliantly done and Romania has declared a national holiday!

Your punch through the Russian right flank was another fine example of true blitzkrieg.  The Romanian Troops followed your example and finished off the Russians quickly.

Hitler sends his compliments to a job well done, and now that your troops are free of this area, he has ordered you join Army Group Center's drive on Moscow!

Good Luck!
