On April 19, the fourth day of the battle, the 1st Belorussian Front broke through the final line of the Seelow Heights defenses (the point that was the operational goal for day 1) and nothing but broken German formations lay between them and Berlin.
12.000 German soldiers were killed and the gates to Berlin swung open - but only at the cost of 70,000 Soviet soldiers and more than 2,000 tanks lost.

Next scenario: 12 deploy hexes. New units have strength 8.
