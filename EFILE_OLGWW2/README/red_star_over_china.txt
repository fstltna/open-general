*** Red Star Over China Open General Version ***
By Santiago Fuertes - LG 2007 - 2011 - http://gilestiel.nerim.net/lg/

*** BACKGROUND.

It's time of blood and revolution. After the chaotic first years of the 19th century, the chinese people would rise agaisnt their oppressors: the landlors and warlords of China. Sun Yat Sen is died, and his succesor, Chiang Kai Shek, is just looking to increase his own power and destroy the Communist Chinese Party (ChCP), the only true rival for the Kuomingtan (KMT) in China. But, the enemies from abroad are also looking the chinese problems, and they are ready to attack the sacred chinese soil.

The asian situation is not easy today, and the Chairman Mao needs men like you. Are you ready to become a ChCP commander and deal with the KMT, the japanese invasion of China and the capitalist powers?, or maybe your ambition will take you to bigger objectives?...

*Comments about the order of battle of the scenarios

This campaign is designed for use a regiment detail level. The order of battle of each unit uses the next scheme:

Regiment (or Battalion)/Division/Army or Corps

I have tried to get all the correct order of battles by date and place. I think I have done a good work, using a lot of sources (not only Internet, but also a lot of books), but maybe I have also done some mistakes. If you think you can help me making corrections on the order of battles, I would like to receive your comments.
