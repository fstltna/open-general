Comrade General, from the very beginning the invasion has been a stunning success.  Seoul is liberated, and the Southern army is in disarray and close to fading into chaos.  The bridges at Seoul have been blown up while there were still large Southern units north of the Han River.  Comrade, collect your forces and meet me at the next briefing, it will be held in the next few hours.
