Peregonovka

Sep 26th, 1919

The Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine is not to be underestimated. They may lack a formal military formation, but they've showed great initiative and knowledge of the terrain. They appear out of nowhere, wipe out some of our garrisons, destroy or steal our supplies, disappear on the plains, regroup and attack some days later in a completely different location. They don't really want to hold the towns they take, their intention is to cause us as much damage as posssible, and they're good at it.

If I want to suceed I'll have to annihilate them in a single action. It's difficult, but I have a plan. I know that the Makhnovist army is near the villlage of Peregonovka. I'll retire the garrisons and place some of my elite units there. They'll have to resist the anarchists' assault until my other units come to their aid, closing the trap.

Victory conditions: 
- Kill 42 enemy units
- Don't lose your VH.
