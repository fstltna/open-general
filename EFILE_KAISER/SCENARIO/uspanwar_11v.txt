Enhorabuena General!

The Yankees have been seriously defeated and are now licking their wounds. They do not longer pose a threat to the Philippines. However, the situation in Cuba is dramatic and the Government has requested to start peace talks. The fate of the Philippines is now in the hands of our politicians. 

Historical background:

The defeat in the Battle of Manila Bay on 1 May decided the Spanish government to organize a relief expedition. On June 16, Rear Admiral Cámara's Reserve Squadron (composed by Spain's most powerful warships, the battleship Pelayo and the brand-new armored cruiser Carlos V, together with some auxiliary cruisers and torpedo-boats) sailed for the Philippines to redress the situation there. Six more steamers carried 5.000 Spanish Army troops, coal and supplies to support the expedition and reinforce Spanish forces already in the Philippines.

When Camara's Squadron arrived at Port Said on 26 June, the Egyptian and British authorities, influenced by the US consul, delayed the supply of coal to the squadron. By the time his ships were able to transit the Suez Canal on 5 July, more than a week later, the Battle of Santiago de Cuba had already destroyed Spanish Squadron under Vice Admiral Cervera, freeing large U.S Navy forces for action elsewhere. Faced with a threat that the Americans begin operations against Spain herself, Cámara was ordered to return home on July 7. Cámara departed Suez on 11 July 1898 for Spain, where the Squadron was dissolved on July 25.
