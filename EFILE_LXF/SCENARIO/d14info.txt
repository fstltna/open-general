14. OPERATION CROW (19 December 1948)

STRATEGIC SITUATION:
The situation in Indonesia is still not satisfying. And more importantly, our country is under heavy international pressure, especially from the United States, to not let the situation escalate. 

On the otherside, many conscripts have to be shipped back to Holland in January 1949 so if we are to undertake any military action it has to be now! So we will. The main goal of the coming Operation Crow will be to fully occupy Java and capture the leaders of the Indonesian Republic.

TACTICAL ORDERS:
Your division is once again deployed on western Java. The main action will take place in central Java but you will advance to Bantam, the western tip of Java. Furthermore you will have to pacify western Java. The nationalists are still fighting a guerilla war!
