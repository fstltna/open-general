August, 10., 1861 Wilson's Creek


Dear Friend,
the northern border of Missouri should be safe .... but now we have to annihilate the last rebel units to secure our supplylines...

General Sigel proposed to use one of our most successful strategies of the 48 revolution: General Lyon should occupy the enemy troops frontally and General Sigel and we will sneak into its back...


ORDERS:
General Sigel's Men, Forward ! Attack them in their Back !

TAKE ALL VH's

ADVICE FROM YOUR OLDEST SERGEANT:
Attention ! If you loose your last captured VH, you've lost the Battle !
