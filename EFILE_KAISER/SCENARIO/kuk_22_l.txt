This hasn't been your best performance in a battle, has it? Thank God, the Ottomans could send enough reserves and the British decided to retire into the Sinai. So all's well that ends well, I suppose.

Although not in a very brilliant way, your task here has finished. The Turks, and some of our second line divisions, will be able to secure the new front line. They could even occupy the Sinai and threaten the Sueskanal. It will depend on the result of the upcoming German offensive in France. And that's precisely the reason why you must go back to Europe. We count on you for the final attack against the French. Are you ready?
