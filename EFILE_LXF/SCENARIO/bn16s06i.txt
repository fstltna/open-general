
TRAPPED AT SANTIAGO - 6 JAN 1937

Bay of Santiago de Cuba, Cuba

Commander in Chief, Atlantic Fleet informs
Our friends, the Cubans were so kind to let your vessels moored in the bay of Santiago until capacity is available in at time congested Guantanamo.
As if by chance the British obviously heard about your arrival and by now a strong enemy flotilla approach and hopes to surprise you. Start your engines and get ready for action. Show the Brits that they have set a trap for themselves!
