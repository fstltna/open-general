Miranda de Ebro

June 12th, 1874

(Fictional scenario)

It is rumored that a group of liberal polititians and military officers intends to proclaim Alfonso,  Infanta Isabel's son, as King . There is no doubt that the People would more readily accept him that King Amadeo or the republic, so it is imperative to march on Madrid before the enemy can react.
While the rest of our Northern Army crosses the river at Haro, you must neutralize the republican resistance in Miranda de Ebro. It will not be easy. We know that liberals have mobilized much of their cavalry to defend the area, so you will have to exercise caution.

Victory conditions: Take all the VHs.

Notes: - The unit that takes Ircio will win a leader.
            - The unit that takes Miranda de Ebro will win +100 pex.
