Good work, Herr General.  With Stalingrad in our hands we can now choose our next move.  Intelligence indicates that the Western Allies are planning a landing in Northwest Afrika.  The General Staff has decided to send significant reinforcements to the Afrika Corps, so you and your men are to transfer to Afrika after a thorough rest and refitting.  Meanwhile Feldmarschall von Paulus's Sixth Army will take your place in Stalingrad.
