On 25th May, against Hitler's orders, Dietrich ordered an assault across the canal to eliminate the French artillery positions on the Wattenberg heights, which commanded the surrounding flatlands.  During the middle of the attack, General Guderian - to whose Panzer Corps the Leibstandarte was subordinate - appeared at Dietrich's HQ demanding to know why orders were being disobeyed.  Dietrich replied that the enemy on Mont Watten could 'look right down the throat' of anyone on the far bank of the canal.  Suitably appraised of the situation and encouraged by the early success of the advance, Guderian immediately approved the decision taken by Dietrich and ordered the 2nd Panzer Division to move up in support.
