Linjiang Campaign

8-3-1947, Jilin Province, NE China.

Congratulations on your promotion to commander of our reciently created People's Liberation Army!. Your actions were enough to support your upgrade decided in the ChCP council... Mao Zedong it's also pleased with you as PLA's general.

Your first assignment as PLA's commander will be in the Jilin province, our base there is placed at Linjiang. The situation in Manchuria is complex. We need Manchuria for some reasons, first, it's border is close with the USSR and the support we are receiving from the Soviets, and second, Manchuria is the most industrialised area in the whole China, we need the resources from here, and we need to avoid the profits the Kuomingtang can get from here.

General, deploy your forces along the front lines we have reached in the past months. Be careful, the lines are not safe; althought we are near to Jilin, Changchun and Siping, the KMT forces still keep a strong attack axis near to our base at Linjiang. The mission will be a complete success if you can besiege Changchun and Jilin, and stop the KMT's assault on Linjiang, GRU spies reports our enemies will also try to recapture the section of the Beijing-Changchun railroad, which is also now our main supply line, protect it at any costs!

Fu qi!.
