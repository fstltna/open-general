The British sent the 4th Armoured Brigade to encircle your positions, but your were able to escape West. All of this not before giving the New Zealanders a bloody nose and crippling the 4th Indian Division at Alem Hamza. 

Next stop: Aghedabia, where the 90th Leichte Division is preparing strong defensive positions.
