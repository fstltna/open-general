"Look at that Annka, must be 40 soldiers around it.Stalin has to be there"."Sargent Terra, move Your troops over to there, we'll wait for the Tiger to show up then move".The Frau Commanders wanted Him alive but Ilse had told Frau Major Gilda she would rather He died and just get it over with.With Stalin dead the Soviet Forces East of the Don would fall apart as the Soviet Generals would fight for control and try to make some Peace with the Frauland.The Fuhress wasn't going to have it, Eradication East of the Don was already taking place and the SS/BdM had control of the Air and bombed at will, anything and everything.Tiger 206 of the 1st SS arrived.It moved down the street.The attack commenced. First the mobile Sig batteries opened up a barrage.The Soviet troops scattered, running every which way, "to Hell with Stalin" they must of said.Some ran into Sargent Terra's machine-gun support and were mowed down.Some tried to surrender and were shot with their hands in the air, the SS was not taking Prisoners any more.The Tiger moved up to get a clear shot.A anti-tank gun, light version fired from a window inside the building on the main floor.A few richochets off the Tiger.Tiger 206 cut loose firing into the main floor, it rocked the whole area.Three more shots from the 88 and the 3 story building collasped.The SS infantry then worked into the rubble, a few shots to kill those injured and Joseph Stalin was found, crushed to death.It was over, Russia was in the hands of the SS.
