Gorlice-Tarnow, May 2, 1915

Gospodin General-Leitenant, the German 11th (Mackensen), Austrian 2nd (Bohm-Ermolli), and Austrian 4th (Linsingen) Armies - have shattered our front in the viscinity of the towns of Gorlice and Tarnow.  Radko-Dmitriev's 3rd Army is not capable of withstanding the numerical superiority of the attacking force, having depleted his divisions in the winter Carpathian campaign.  The X (Protopopov), III Kavkazky (Irmanov), and XXIV (Trurikov) Corps lie in the immediate path of the advancing enemy.  You must delay the Germano-Austrian advance by recapturing key defensive positions.
