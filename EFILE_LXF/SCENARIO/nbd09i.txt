Commander, our Australian Allies and some of our troops have 
found themselves in a bit of a fix. They have successfully surrounded the 
Japanese stronghold in the Vicinity of Buna and Gona on the North shore of 
New Guinea. They are unable to break through the Japanese defenses and 
intelligence has reported that the Japanese commander is planning to launch a 
counter-attack. You will go in as reinforcement. Surely, with the help of your 
experienced men, the stalemate can be broken.
