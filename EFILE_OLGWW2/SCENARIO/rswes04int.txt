Battle for Tinian

July, 1944

The past year has been a dissaster for Japan, General. Our positions in the Solomons are really damaged by the continuous allied assaults. Our defeat in Guadalcanal has also given the enemies a good base to threaten our communications and launch other operations agaisnt us in Southern Asia.

Now, we are completely sure the next goal of the enemies will be the Marianas. If the americans can capture this target, they will be able to launch air strikes agaisnt Japan from here. I want to be sincere, we haven't any chance of stop a powerful seaborne enemy attack, so kill as many american soldiers as you can, and maybe the US High Command will change its mind on the approach to the main japanese islands...

Stop the Americans as much as possible, and then, evacuate this island.

[Defensive Scenario Info.]: Withdraw at least 7 of your units by driving your units to the red hexe on the South before the americans capture the whole island.
