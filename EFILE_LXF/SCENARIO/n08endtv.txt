What, Comrade General?  I see.  Yes.  Really?   Well, you did the right thing, Comrade General.  Your advance was admirable.  Yes, if the enemy counterattacked your open flanks it is indeed wisest to retreat in order to prevent being destroyed.  Without knowing it you have benefited the communist cause by your actions!  While you occupied many United Nation forces trying to plug the holes in their open lines, the Chinese west of you have been able to advance and liberate Seoul.  The front is now stabilized across the peninsula some 50 miles south of Seoul.  Time to resupply and make ready for the final push.  Now let us eat some good rice, Comrade General!

AFTERMATH

The front stabilized at the end of January 1951 on a line 50 miles south of Seoul across the Korean peninsula.  The communist forces were exhausted and short of supplies after three months of offensive warfare in a hundred mile long advance.  Meanwhile the UN forces regained its morale and strength.  Starting in early January and ending in early February operations Thunderbolt and Roundup made the frontline roll north some 50 miles.  Communist forces retreated without heavy fighting to a main defensive line which was now reached by the United Nation forces.
