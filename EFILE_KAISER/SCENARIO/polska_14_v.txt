This will be remembered as one of the largest cavalry battles in modern history and it has been a great victory for Poland! Although Budionny and part of his army were finally able to breakthrough our lines and retreat to the east, their losses were very high and I don't think they'll be a threat to us anymore.

But we can't stop now! We must continue our counteroffensive and recover all of the territories lost to the Russians in the last months. Your next destination will be the Niemen River.
