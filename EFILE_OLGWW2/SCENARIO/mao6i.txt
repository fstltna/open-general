Central Plains Breakout

22-6-1946, Wuhan, Hubei province.

Nice to see you again... I hope the lessons you have reciently taken in the USSR about the modern warfare will be useful for us now. Well, please sit down, I have some information to bring you about the current situation.

As you know, the Soviet victory agaisnt the Japanese in Manchuria the past year has opened the gate of the regular support of hardware and weapons to us. Now, the ChCP troops are better equipped and trained. The Soviets have given us some Japanese captured equipment from Manchuria, like tanks and artillery and the Japanese prisoners are training our brave men. They had no choice: work in Siberia or work with us!.

However, it's still soon to enjoy our new training and equipment... the bad news?, well the mission of the US general George Marshall to pacificate China and reach an agreement between us and the KMT is a clear failure. The Kuomingtan have taken advantage of the time just to rearm their units, and now they are clearly taking positions around our areas, probably to anihilate us like in the 30's. In case of the outbreak of the war... your mission is to drive your units in Wuhan to the West, to join the central ChCP units in Central China.
