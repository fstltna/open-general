Welcome General, some water?  Its Hungarian you know, now that they and the Romanians are our comerades in arms we can aquire things a little more easily.

We are at the gates of Tobruk.  We must destroy the British here to secure our hold in Tunesia, and set up for future operations in Egypt.

A relief column has been spotted moving to break our ring around Tobruk, and our Navy can only hope to keep the RN busy, we will not see any naval support.

INTEL REPORT:  This will be a tough fight.  The British are entrenched in a well coordinated defense.  On top of that the RAF is quite experienced.  To win this battle we must defeat them in detail.
