The Fourth Battle of Kharkov - August 1943 V
You have inflicted great tank losses on the 5GTA. However, Russian advances to the North and South of us, force us to retreat to the Dnepr. Most of your forces are sent to France for rest and refit. Only a Kampfgruppe will remain on the Eastern front until the spring of 1944.
