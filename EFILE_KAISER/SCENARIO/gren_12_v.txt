Once again my men fought with a remarkable proficiency, but we only managed to slow the German advance, which seemed unstoppable. Every day they got closer to Paris, and I started to believe that they could actually repeat their victory of 1870.

But Providence had not have forsaken us, and Von Kluck had already made a terrible mistake. Believing that there were not any significant enemy forces in the Southwest, ahead of him, on August 31st he had ordered a change of direction, to the Southeast. Maybe he wanted to envelope us. Maybe he believed that it would be a shorter way to Paris. Maybe it was just that his troops were exhausted. 
Anyway, it was a wrong move that cost the Germans the war, because to the Southwest there was a whole French Army waiting for Von Kluck, and his imprudent decision had exposed his right flank to our French allies.
