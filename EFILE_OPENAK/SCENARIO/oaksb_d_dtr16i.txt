Herr General, I know that you and your men have not had time even to catch a breath, but the situation here is critical. Buda-Pest is besieged by the Bolsheviks. Your troops must force their way into the city. It is doubtful that our Hungarian allies will continue to fight if Buda-Pest falls. If you can drive the Reds into the Danube, we may stop the Russian Bear from consuming us.
