09. BONIS COUNTERATTACK (3 July 1945)

The area at the Bonis peninsula has been taken over by 23rd Brigade. Two battalions have now been concentrated to hold the frontline. Patrols are indicating ferious Japanese activity and Headquarters fears that the enemy might be up for a huge break-out or counterattack like they performed against the Americans in March previous year. 

In any case, you have been ordered to hold the frontline at all costs and to continue with agressive patrols to ensure better defensive positions where possible. The war in the Pacific is coming closer to Japan itself. The war might be over sooner than we expect. Good luck, General!
