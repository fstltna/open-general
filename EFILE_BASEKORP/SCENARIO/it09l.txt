TOBRUK - THE EASTERN OFFENSIVE April 1941 - L

Failure! Most of the tanks of the 5th Pz.Rgt. were able to make it back to our lines, but many soldiers of the 8th Mg.Btn. have been captured. 

We will attack Tobruk again once the first units of the 15th Panzer Division have arrived.

Note: Only 6 ground units can be deployed in the next scenario.
