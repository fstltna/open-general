Tabriz, January 17 1915
Gospodin General-Leitenant, following the unexpected rout of the Turkish 3rd Army at Sarykamysh, the Kavkaz Front command has tasked the IV Kavkaz Corps (Organovsky) with restoring the territorial integrity of the left (southern) flank.  In an effort to maintain control of troops traversing rugged terrain, groups (Otriady) have been formed at roughly brigade level.  You will take command of the Azerbaijansky Otriad (Chernozubov) and retake the city of Tabriz, which was hastily abandoned in December of 1914.

The retirement of our troops from the city had caused widespread panic among the Armenian population of the city:  fearing retribution from Turkey's soldiers, they had attempted to flee the border regions of Alashkert, Van, and Tabriz, but with little success.  We now have reports that some Armenians have organized into Armenian Druzhiny-volunteer units willing to support our army.  On the other side, our retreat had given Turkey the ability to recruit the wavering local populations of Bedouin and Kurd tribesmen to their cause:  be aware of Kurd raiders on your flanks.

As you advance into Tabriz, you will make contact with the volunteer Armenian units.  Large stockpiles of supplies had been left behind in December by our army:  upon capture of the city, you will be able to resupply your army and deploy in full.
