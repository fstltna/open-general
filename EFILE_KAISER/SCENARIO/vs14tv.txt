Congratulations. The Belgian army has started to evacuate Antwerp. Their 2nd Division supported by the three British Brigades are covering the retreat.

Our left flank - the 4th Ersatz Division, the 37th Landwehr Brigade and the 1st Bavarian Landwehr Brigade - is moving West and North on Dendermonde and Lokeren to prevent the Belgian Army retreating to Gent where Uhlanen have spotted French and British troops that have come to the aid of the Belgians.
