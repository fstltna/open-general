The Red Army was virtually destroyed after Klin. Tukhachevsky led some surviving regiments to Petrograd, where they defended themselves for a couple of weeks until our army defeated them for good. In the end, all the Bolshevik leaders were killed or taken prisoner, or they had to flee to foreign lands.

We had finally taken our country back. Our losses had been huge, including our Tzar and His family, but Old Mother Russia wasn't lost. We'd do our best to heal her.

Yes, Russia and the Turkestan were safe at last, but what about the other possessions of the empire? Sadly, we had to accept the loss of many territories. In February, Kolchak signed the Treaty of Tiflis, acknowledging the independence of the republics of Georgia and Armenia, which became Russian allies. We quickly sent them arms, ammunition and advisors that they could use in their wars against Turkey and Azerbaijan.

Besides, the League of Nations let us know that they wouldn't tolerate any Russian action against the sovereignty of Finland, Poland or the Baltic republics. We had no choice but to accept those demands.

However, they didn't say anything about Belarus or Ukraine, and we were determined to keep those lands under Russian control.
