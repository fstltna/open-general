AC 102 - The Battle of Vercellae

Catulus army (20,300 men) and Marius army (32,000 men) stood at Vercellae face to face with the Cimbri (160,000 men, women and children with a 15,000 strong  cavalry) . 
As the Cimbri were tired of wandering and fighting, Boiorix made the proposition to serve as mercenaries for the Romans and get therefor permission to settle here.
The Romans refused, and demonstrated Teutobod, King of the Teutons - the sister nation of the Cimbri - as a prisoner. 
Then, both sides prepared for battle.
The Cimbrian horsemen attacked the Romans frontal, but swung to the right to bring the Romans little by little between themselves and their infantry, which stood on the left side. 
Although the Roman generals understood the cunning ruse,they could not hold back their legionaries in  lineup, after someone had claimed the enemies trying to escape. 
Shortly after the beginning of the attack a huge cloud of dust arose from the dry plains, so Marius and his trops first missed the Cimbris and wandered around for a while , until they met by chance on the enemy from behind.
Meanwhile the main Cimbri army  came up against Catulus. The Cimbri, who were more used to the cooler climate of the North had to fight with the heat of the southern countries. The Romans, however, were hardened by their years of training so the heat made them no problems. 
This was crucial to the battle.
The Cimbri lost. The fugitives were driven into camps... 60,000 captives were sold into slavery. 
Some of the surviving captives are reported to have been among the rebelling Gladiators in the Third Servile War...
