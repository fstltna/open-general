Fortress Küstrin
Your troops have arrived the Oder at Küstrin. Take Küstrin, take positions along the river and build a bridgehead over the river at Küstrin. 
Your troops:
You will only have your tank army for this mission.
Enemy troops:
Küstrin is hold by a garrison. Behind the Oder some strong German troops will try to prevent that you can build a bridgehead. But altogether the enemy should be no problem for your troops.
Attention please:
A brilliant victory, a normal victory and a tactical victory will lead you into different paths. 
If you win brilliant, you have to end the war with the battle in Berlin. This scenario will be no-auto-refit, too.
If you win normal the west allied have captured Berlin and you have to fight against them. In this path you have the help of German troops, which you can buy for extra pp.
If you win tactical the west allied have captured Berlin and you have to fight against them. The German armies in the east could flee into the west and will support the west allies.
