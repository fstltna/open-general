
PLAYER CHOICE SCENARIO

After your fighting in our Saar Offensive and redrawal, you are given the choice where you will rest and refit.

You can choose for 2nd Army under General Huntziger which deployed at the western end of the Maginot Line in the vicinity of Sedan. Or you can choose for the 7th Army under General Giraud which is deployed in northern France in the area of Dunkirk. Both assignments will offer action once the war regains its active nature.

THE SOUTHERN PATHS CONTAINS THE NEXT BATTLES: SEDAN, LAON, AMIENS I AND AMIENS II.

THE NORTHERN PATH CONTAINS THE NEXT BATTLES: BREDA, GEMBLOUX, ARRAS, LILLE AND DUNKIRK. 

AFTER EITHER AMIENS II OR DUNKIRK BOTH PATHS WILL JOIN AGAIN. BOTH PATHS ARE EQUAL IN DIFFICULTY AND FUN.
