    "We'll have to do that Frau Nekker"  05/02/42
  Frau General Glorrus Nekker sitting in Her staff car.A Russian Female sniper being searched for after killing Nekker's driver and of course it could have as easily been Nekker.Snipers on the Fronts were making an impact on both sides but the Russians with their advantage in numbers were taking out a lot of SS officers with some Snipers racking up as many as 70 kills.So the protection was stepped Up after a call to the Fuhress and any Sniper caught was tortured for a long time before put to Death.So Nekker as other High-ranking officers would be moved back from the Front lines and protected better.The SS was on the move and the Leningrad Front was heading to meet the Moscow Front to work in coordination.Joseph Stalin had gave up on stopping those coming from Leningrad and would work on slowing them down and destroying the Moscow and Stalingrad Fronts.So His numbers started to be sent to those areas.The Frau's on the Front lines coming from the North could not tell that though they did see the Armor was not as overwhelming as in the past.Again they thanked the 'Tigers for that.
