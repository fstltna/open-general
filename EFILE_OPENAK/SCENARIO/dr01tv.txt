Panzer-Verbaende Ostpreussen Tactical Victory

Herr General. The crisis is over, and the Polish Army has collapsed.   Unfortunately, some of the enemy has retreated into Romania.  No doubt, we will encounter these tough and vengeful troops again.  There are other repercussions as well.  The British and French have now declared war on Germany. 

HISTORY
Panzer Division Kempf fought more battles with the Poles at Rozan, Lomza, Kliczym and Modlin. The division was disbanded after the Polish campaign at a farewell parade near Neidenburg at October 7th 1939.
