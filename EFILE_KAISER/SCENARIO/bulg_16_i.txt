Second battle of Doiran

April 22nd, 1917

After your past victories we have had some months without any big military operation. However, the morale of our soldiers is starting to be alarmingly low. Their bravery and patriotism is out of question, but life in the trenches is always hard, and flux and malaria make it still worse. Right now it's impossible for them to foresee when this war will end.
The situation of the British troops at the Doiran Lake isn't good, either. But they are determined to break the Macedonian front during their spring offensive. Right now, three British divisions are preparing an offensive against us. This time all of our positions must hold, so don't forget it. Prepare your troops and good luck.


Victory conditions: After 13 turns you must hold 4 VHs for a BV, 3 VHs for a V, or 2 VHs for a TV.
