Well done, General! Our enemies' losses have been staggering, and their hopes on a quick occupation of Elsass are gone. However, our casualties have been high, too, and due to the immediate arrival of a large contingent of French reinforcements, it'll be wiser to retreat behind the Rhein while we try to outflank them with a counterattack in Lothringen.
