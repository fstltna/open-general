We have been moved to the Ardennes region for a final offensive.  We are part of 6th SS Panzer Army, commanded by Sepp Dietrich.  We must break through the US XVIII Corps lines in the Ardennes, seize the high ground of Elsenborn Ridge and control of roads in the north, and then move to capture the vital bridges accross the Meuse between Liege and Huy.
