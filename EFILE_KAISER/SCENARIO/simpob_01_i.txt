Uncountable trophies: the Komuch offensive (II)

August 4th, 1918

As soon as we took Simbirsk, Kappel started to plan an offensive to capture Kazan, against the orders of the Komuch, that still wanted an attack on Saratov.

According to Kappel's plan, the People's Army and the Czechs would advance along both shores of the Volga and would attack the Bolsheviks from several directions, trapping them in the town or forcing them to flee. The communists outnumbered us three to one, so the greater mobility of our troops would be decisive. We'd use all the river boats that we had been able to find in order to advance along the Volga faster.

Besides, we knew that among the best Soviet units there were some foreign fighters, especially Serbians, that were discontent with their communist masters and would rebel against them if they had the chance. Not all the non-Russians would do the same. Most of the Latvians, the Tatars and the Hungarians seemed to be loyal to the Bolsheviks, and they were all veteran soldiers. We knew that the battle would be tough, but we were confident after our past victories in Samara and Simbirsk.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.

Special note:
- When you take the VHs at Kazan, new units will join your core.
