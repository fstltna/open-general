Raid on Oslo

GKdoS 4711/0815:

In the course of the preventative operation 'Weseruebung' have your airborne units occupy Oslo and and surrounding localities!  
The central supply landing strip Fornebu must be held at all cost.
For the defense of air strips numerous Flak units will be dropped in.
Simultaneously heavy naval units will make a rapid entry through the Oslo Fjord and support the attack on Norway's capital, which boldly calls itself "neutral".
To prevent the Allies to beat us to it, speed is of highest priority.

-----------------------------

Day order for Norway Defense Forces:

As a neutral nation we shall know how to preserve our independence in this conflict. To this end we also will accept the support of British troops, whose landing, according to London, is imminent. The main thing is that the German fascists do not set foot on our soil - despite repeated demands by Mr. Quisling.
In any case, be prepared for all eventualities!
