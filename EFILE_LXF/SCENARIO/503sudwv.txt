11. Operation Südwind (Gran Bridgehead) VICTORY

You did it General! You wiped out the Bolsheviks form the west bank of Gran. Your victory makes possible another pointless though heroic counterattack north from the Lake Balaton. Unfortunately your troops suffered severe losses, 503. sPzAbt ceased to exist as an independent formation. The surviving Tigers will be attached the Panzerkorps Feldherrnhalle. Your career as a commanding officier ends here and now. 

Thanks for playing the campaign!
