Your next mission is to defeat the Yugoslav and Greek armies and force the British forever from the European mainland. You should capture your objectives by April 30th so that our upcoming invasion of Russia is not delayed. If you are able to complete your mission earlier, we may honor you with the command of our planned airborne assault on Crete.
