09. LEROS (12 November 1943)

To the commanding officer of 22. ID (LL):

Because of the swift German reaction to the British invasion of the Dodecanesos, the British are now left without any airfield on few, small islands. The Royal Navy have suffered various losses while supplying its army. The only real threat in the region is the island fortress of Leros.

Your Kampfgruppe will be the main component of the invasion force. You will be supported by Luftwaffe units and Fallschirmjager. Brandenburger forces will conduct diversionary attacks. The enemy has strong positions on the island and can be supported by aircraft and destroyers daring to go so far from their bases. You must not fail.


RULES: 
- Do not upgrade, sell or buy units - nor upgrading transports.
- Replacing lost units by buying new units is allowed. Replacements should be the exact same unit as the lost unit.
