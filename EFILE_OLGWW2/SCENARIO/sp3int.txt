El Cairo

November 14th, 1942

El Cairo is in front of us, after more than one year of battles in Africa we are starting the final assault on the British stronghold of Egypt. 

The coast of Egypt is closed, Alexandria and Port Said are under our control, however the British have not accepted our offer of surrender. Now we must assault the city to end the British control over North Africa.
