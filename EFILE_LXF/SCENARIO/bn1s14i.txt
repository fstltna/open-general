HQ Army Group H, Netherlands
General Kurt Student

General, the Allies have landed an airborne division at Arnhem. Allied documents have fallen in our hands with details of their planed operations. You must stop the advance of a British tank corps at Eindhoven. Without support the Allied airborne divisions should be cannon fodder. Good luck, General!
