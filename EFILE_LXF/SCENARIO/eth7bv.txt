BRILLANT VICTORY

The fiercest fighting took place in the early afternoon, as both sides moved forward. Often the Italian guns had to fire at point-blank range.

In fact this was the bitterest day's fighting the Italians ever had to face in the North. Everywhere there was ferocious hand-to-hand fighting.

Except for Ras Imru's guard, the Ethiopians had only 20 rounds per man. Maravigna's Corps had fired 10 million cartridges and 50,000 shells as much as the whole Ethiopian northern line possessed at the beginning of the war.

Ras Imru had put forward a plan to organize guerrilla warfare in Ayalew's own mountainous territory of the Simien but the Dejaz would not hear of it.
