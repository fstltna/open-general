Coup de Grace: Smashing the Ebro's Army

Orders from: Burgos, September, 1938

You are aware that after we split the Republic into two territories the Reds launched a powerful strike across the Ebro River in August.  Although they took us by surprise and inflicted some losses; the brave National Army reacted quickly stopping the enemy at the gates of Gandesa.  Your orders are to deploy your troops and ruthlessly crush the Reds in the Ebro pocket.

Buena suerte General!
