Commander, good to see you. You did a good job for us in Italy. Now we turn to some more serious business. As you know, we have been preparing to invade Hitler's "Fortress Europe" for some time now. The moment has now arrived. Our men and equipment are loading aboard their ships at this moment. Our men don't lack in courage, but they do lack in experience. Ike feels that we need a proven combat officer and some highly skilled veteran units to spearhead this assault. Commander, you and your men have been chosen for this role. You must lead us to victory!
