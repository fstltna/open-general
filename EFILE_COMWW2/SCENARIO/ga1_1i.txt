May 24 1942
Good Morning General. HQ has directed me to inform you that some of your forces are being transferred to Malta to participate in the defence of the island. Latest intelligence indicates that the Axis air attacks are, to some extent, covertly being coordinated from the ground. The murderous aerial seige of Malta continues, but so does our will to defend this most strategically important island. Malta must not fall to the Axis forces. 
Drive them from the skies!

VICTORY CONDITIONS: 

Destroy the marked Bf-109F4,  Z.1007 bis, and Transmitter...

NOTE: 

You may deploy 1 ground unit and your aircraft...
