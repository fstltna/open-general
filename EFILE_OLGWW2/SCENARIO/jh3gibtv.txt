Gibraltar is ours, thanks mainly to the skill of Feldmarschall Kesselring in breaking through the defenses on the Spanish side.  Of course, our ally Spain will be given nominal soverignty over Gibraltar, but it will serve us as our base.  Herr General, you did not handle this difficult assignment with the skill you have shown in previous battles.  However, you will be given another chance.  After some rest and recuperation you and your men will probably be called upon to play a role in our 1941 spring campaign.
