The Second Great War
A summary of the conflict from 1946-1954

(The following excerpt has been taken from The Second Great War, a definitive summary of the conflict that engulfed the world from 1946-1954.  We are most grateful that the author has allowed us to take an excerpt from his book.)

The Red Army, after more than seven years of total war, had finally accomplished Josef Stalin's dream of "manifest destiny" in Europe.  From Moscow to Madrid, the entire continent of Europe would soon unite under an iron curtain of oppression.  

The general responsible for the final blow to the Allies, the capture of London, was soon swept in as the Premier of the USSR after Stalin was mysteriously assassinated. Puppet governments were quickly established in the deposed Allied powers, as had been done in a formerly democratic China some time earlier.  

Aside from the United States, which had remained neutral throughout the conflict, the world was essentially under Soviet control for the next four decades.  Luckily for the peoples of Europe, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics would collapse in the 1990's under mysterious circumstances, though it is commonly believed that the end of Soviet rule was the result of internal power politics and regional terrorism draining the nation's resources. It cannot be disputed that had the Soviets failed to conquer London in that last dramatic battle of the Second World War, the world today would be a much different place.
