
PONT-DU-FAHS - 19 APR 1943

After battles around Faid, French forces are moved north to garrison the Eastern Dorsal Range around Fondouk el Aouareb. In mid-February Axis forces attack the area around Kasserine but are finally driven back after hard battles, in your sector there is little fighting, however you are ordered to withdraw from the area around the Fondouk Pass. You are subsequently moved north to prepare for future offensives.

In early April the Axis are in retreat and only hold the area around Tunis. An offensive, Operation Vulcan, is planned for mid-April with the intention of capturing Tunis on a long front. Your Corps' sector is on the southern part of the line, between the British 8th Army and 9 Corps and you face the 5th Panzer Army and the famed Afrika Korps (although not commanded by Rommel since early March). Your orders for Operation Vulcan are to advance on the town of Pont-du-Fahs and defeat Axis forces in the area.

GOAL: Take all VH's!

NOTE: YOU ONLY HAVE LIMITED DEPLOYMENT IN THIS SCENARIO!
