Better to burn out: The Tobol offensive (II)

September 25th, 1919

The day that we were expecting finally arrived. We were told to follow our advance along the railroad, eliminating the Bolshevik resistance until we reached the river Tobol.

Then our orders were to cross the river, take Kurgan and go to the north, completing the encirclement of the 2nd and the 3rd Red Armies. If we suceeded, Lenin's minions would be trapped, and nothing could stop us from liberating all of Siberia.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.

Special note:
- You can buy equipment from the Cossack Hosts in this scenario.
