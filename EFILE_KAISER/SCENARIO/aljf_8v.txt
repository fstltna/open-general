THE WHITE HOUSE; WASHINGTON,

Dear Sir,
we are glad to inform you that the president of the United States is happy about your achievement namely securing Arkansas for the Union. He has ordered 300pp from the treasury to be payed to you for recruiting new troops.
Another 300pp could be attained by capturing enemy blockade runners which will be put at your disposal too.

THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
