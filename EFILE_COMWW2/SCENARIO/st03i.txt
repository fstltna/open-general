Herr General: The 4th Panzer Armee has made amazing progress since rejoining our drive to the Volga river. They are now just 73 miles southwest of Stalingrad! Your performance in the Donets Basin has also helped to throw the Soviets off balance, and now you will follow-up by taking the area between the Don and the Volga rivers, while continuing on to eventually link up with the 4th Panzer Armee which is swinging north east to join in the assault on Stalingrad...
