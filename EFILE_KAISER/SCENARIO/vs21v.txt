Battle of the Somme,  Flers-Courcelette - September 21st 1916 - V

Even though the British threw in many divisions - supported by some new metal monsters - you held most of the third line of defence. Well done General. Fresh troops will take over this sector of the front.


Historical events:
- July 1st: The Somme offensive starts with 750,000 men after a week-long bombardment in the British sector. The British loose 58,000 troops on day one. The French conduct a short surprise bombardment only and do much better: small advancing groups of men reach all day-1 targets without suffering heavy losses.
- July 11th: The British secure the first line of German trenches. German troops are transferred from the Verdun sector, doubling the number of men available.
- July 14th: The attack on the second Germen line of defense starts after a short hurricane-like bombardment. It is relatively successful, but is not followed up due to communication failures, casualties and disorganization. Attacks late July and August did not generate much gains.
- September 15th: The third and final general offensive - that saw tanks deployed in small numbers - lasted until mid November. It achieved considerable tactical gains, but did not achieve a breakthrough. 

The Somme was the debut of the Kitchener Army created by Lord Kitchener's call for recruits at the start of the war. They suffered heavy losses: 420,000. French losses were about 200,000 and German losses about 500,000. Germany, also at war against Russia, started to lose the war of attrition.
