Valley of the River Moldova
(July 19, 1917)

The fighting capability of the Russian Army has deterioriated since the February Revolution. Kerensky, the Russian Minister of War ordered General Brusilov to launch another major offensive in the hope that a new victory would provide a boost to morale. Luckily, after some initial success in the area of Lemberg, this offensive collapsed quickly. The German and Austro-Hungarian High Commands both agree that this is the right time to hit the Russian troops hard and force them out of the war once and for all. Unfortunately, the Romanians still show a strong commitment to the fight and their army doesn't look nearly as desperate as their Russian allies. It's your job to defeat the Romanian and Russian forces, and push them out of South-Bukovina.

ORDER: Keep your MSU alive and take all VHs.
