General Albert Kesselring

Wonderful job, General Major! The sea route to Africa is finally safe! It is a serious defeat for the British Empire. If we can strike the British now in North Africa, their resistance will finally be broken. We need your division now for a special mission in the east. You will fly to the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea to prepare the operation.
