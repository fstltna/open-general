Cambrai

Nov 30th, 1917

Your arrival has been providential, General. This new British offensive has caught us by surprise and now all the front is in danger. Even the Siegfriedstellung could fall if we don't find a way to counterattack.
Not only did our enemies achieve surprise. Their usage of artillery and veteran infantry units, supported by a large number of tanks, has been extremely clever. Our trenches and fortifications have been useless against this new tactics. It's time for you to gather your troops and try to infiltrate behind the British lines. That could be our last chance.

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.
