Welcome General, you are just in time to hear the operations briefing.

"Gentlemen.......as you know we have prepared for the final drive to Moscow these past two weeks after our return march from closing the Kiev encirclements........

The German panzercorps will form the right wing of the assault.  The Axis corps will form the left wing.  We expect the right to be able to penetrate quickly on the far right flank, and then race for the far objectives.

The center and left wing will have a harder going.  But it is eesential that the left and center press the Russians hard to not allow them to disengage and prevent the right panzercorps from conducting its exploitation.

STAFF INTEL:  The Russians are defending in depth and have several large tank brigades to counterattack with.  We must defeat them in detail - AND move quickly in no less than divisional battle-groups.
