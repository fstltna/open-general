And so it was how the Italian invaders were destroyed a second time, twenty years after Adwa. All the enemy survivors retreated to the safety of the Eritrean Highlands.

The British, who until them had made calls to the cessation of hostilities, suddenly warned us that, if we dared to cross the border in order to pursue the Italians, they'd consider it an act of aggression, and would declare war on us, too.

Under no circumstances would we ever have wanted to annoy the mighty British Empire, but the empress understood that it was the only option that we had. It was obvious that Italy didn't want peace. They had just retreated to Eritrea, but they didn't even have asked for a ceasefire, much less for the opening of peace negotiations. If we stopped now, we'd just give them the time that they needed to recover and reinforce themselves, and in a few months they'd invade us again. 

No, our only option was to attack, and conquer the mountain passes before they could react. We knew that the Italian government was making plans to send two or three infantry brigades from Albania to Eritrea. We needed to control the Eritrean Highland before that could happen.
