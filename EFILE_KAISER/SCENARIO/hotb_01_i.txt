Cuba: San Juan Hill/ El Caney

July 1st, 1898

We're just a couple of miles from Santiago, and it seems that Linares hasn't learnt from his mistakes. Yes, he has established strong defensive positions at San Juan and Kettle hills, and at El Caney, too, but he's sent just a few hundred men there.  Most of the Spanish soldiers are still in Santiago, waiting for a Cuban attack that will never come. Their presence there is completely useless, and that's great for our plans. When San Juan and El Caney fall, Santiago will be completely encircled and the Spaniards will be trapped there. Their only option will be surrender.
