December 7 1942

Herr General: The Soviets have disrupted our planned relief of Stalingrad! They have forced their way across the Chir river and have taken Sovkhoz 79, and Sysokin, threatening to roll up our entire line, and thus preventing Hoth's 4th Panzer Armee from moving into position at Kotelnikovo. You must stabilize the situation here in order to allow our relief attempt to begin!
