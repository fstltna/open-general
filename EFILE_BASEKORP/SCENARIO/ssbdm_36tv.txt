"What the Hell size of artillery is that Cassie"? "I don't know but I've never seen a Tiger go up like that.That Tank crew didn't have time to take a piss".The Russians had moved some heavy mobile batteries in the area and they were cutting loose."Listen to that Dam thing.Don't guess they got a Battleship on land do You Zenna"? "The Russians are pretty crazy Cassie but I don't think they are that Crazy.You know in a few minutes though Captain Nytoll is going to be looking for some volunteers to try and sight that Russian gun and as bad as She hates You always mouthing off to Her I would rather not be close to You when She shows up"."Well Zenna You spoke too soon,here comes Bitch Nytoll now"."Zenna,Cassie get Your sorry asses over here.Now listen You two,I need You to go out there and locate that Gun,then I can get some air-support to destroy it otherwise the Air Commanders won't send planes on search missions,not for us anyway".So Zenna and Cassie got to venture through No-Frau's Land and would just have to hope they was Lucky to not be were a Shell was landing.They were not.Later the Russians moved the Gun back but it was spotted by a recon vehicle then 2 FrauWind-Z's were sent and it was destroyed.Zenna and Cassie were two more souls who just didn't exist no more,the large Shell left nothing but fragments of what use to be SS Fraus.
