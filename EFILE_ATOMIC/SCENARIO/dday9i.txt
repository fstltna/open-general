ORDERS: 

General, after the tiering and exhausting fight for the Hürtgen Forest your Army will send back to Belgium for refreshes. Allied forces are about to launch Operation Pheasant, the liberation of Northern Brabant, Netherlands. After all your forces have reached combat readiness again, you are then ordered to join forces with the 1st Polish Armoured Division and liberate the cities of Breda, 's-Hertogenbosch, Tilbur, Bergen Op Zoom, Roosendaal, Dordrecht and their vicinity as part of Operation Pheasant.

The Dutch resistance network reports that the german defences mostly consist of several infantry divisions. Only one heavy self-propelled anti-tank (schwere Panzer-Jagt-Abteilung) formation is reported in the area.

A few hints: 

German jet fighters, type Me 262 have been reported in this area too! Be cautious! We expect heavy Luftwaffe attacks in the next weeks.
