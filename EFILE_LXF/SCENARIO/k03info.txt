03. HOLLAND (11 May 1940)

TO: Fregattenkapitaen
SUBJECT: Invasion of Holland

---Our huge offensive in the West has begun. For months the western Allies have done nothing but waiting for us to strike. The Kriegsmarine is coming closer to controlling the Norwegian waters but now our attention has shifted to the North Sea.

Our operational area for amphibious actions is small because the English Channel limits further operations. The Royal Navy is still a very strong opponent and even the French Fleet is to reckon with. Your Marine Corps will land on the western coast of Holland. The Dutch Royal Navy is no opponent for your flotilla but beware of your distance to Britain: the English will be able to send small ships, submarines and even aircraft against you while you are laying at the Dutch shore assisting the troops.

The Dutch have a small but reliable army. Paratroopers have already landed at the airfield in Holland and are reinforced by troops in gliders. Also Luftwaffe units will assist the operation. Be quick, because the Royal Navy will steam out if the battle continues longer than a few days.---
