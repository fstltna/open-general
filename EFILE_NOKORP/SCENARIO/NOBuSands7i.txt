That's it, we can't resupply you any more: The British aviation has literally decimated the Italians' trucks on those hundreds of kilometers of road from Tripoli to here.

Fortunately you've reached Tobruk: You need to use your last supplies to capture it as fast as possible. If you don't succeed it will be a long retreat, on foot...

Beware, the British know how desperately we need this port, they won't give it up without a fight. Not that they ever give anything up without a fight. Ahm. Anyway. Go get them, Generalleutnant!


Instructions: Capture all VHs.
