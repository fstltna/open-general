Verdun - June, 1916 - BV

Amazing, Oberstleutnant. Fort Vaux is under our control and the French are desperately trying to rebuild their defence lines near Fleury. With more victories like yours, I'm sure that they'll have to surrender before the end of the summer. That is, if Britain and Russia don't lauch any offensives of their own in support of their French allies. That would be lethal for our plans.

But let's not worry about the possibility until it presents itself. Now rest for a few days. We'll call you if we need your services again at the front of Verdun. When this battle is finally over, there will be a new mission waiting for you.
