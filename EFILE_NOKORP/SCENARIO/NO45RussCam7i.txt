At last we have arrived to the outskirts of Moscow. This is the big battle.

We now know why we met with so little resistance so far: The Soviets have concentrated everything around Moscow, and have fortified the city beyond belief.

Despite of the quality and training of your troops, you will have a hard time breaching this fortress. For this reason we have assigned some additional elite troops to your force, and among them our impressive 80 cm railway gun, the Schwerer Gustav, which will allow you to easily smash their fortifications. Don't lose it though! Your career will suffer!

Be careful, the enemy is desperate and outnumbers you 10 to 1. This is a chance to show them that our army is way superior to theirs.
Go get them!



Instructions: Capture the VHs. Don't let the "Schwerer Gustav" get destroyed, it would mean defeat.
