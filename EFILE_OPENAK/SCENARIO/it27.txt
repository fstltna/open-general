FAID PASS January30 1943

Operation Eilbote I brought the pass at Barrage de l'Oued Kebir, the Karachoum Gap and the Kairouan Pass in our hands. German forces - supported by our troops - will now follow up with an attack on the Faid pass. At the same time our troops are still involved in skirmishes with US II Corps forces around Sened and Maknassy.  

Notes: 
- Only 3 core ground units and all core air units can be deployed from the start. More ground forces (Centauro) can be deployed later.

News: 
- Germany extracts its specialist officers from Stalingrad. They get priority over wounded men on flights out.
- Tripoli has fallen to 8th Army after our troops continued their retreat towards the Tunisian border.
- General Giulio Martinat, chief-of-staff of our Alpini Corps in Russia was killed while personally leading a successful attack to break through Russian blocking positions at Nikolajevka, an attack which opened a path for our encircled troops, Germans and Hungarians to escape and regain Axis lines. A victory against all odds, with no artillery and no air support and on foot.
