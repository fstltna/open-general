Cape Helles Landings - 25/04/1915
--------------------------------------------------------
Good evening, General! Welcome to our last meeting before the start of our operation - the greatest amphibious landing ever attempted!

While ANZAC will be landing further north at Ari Burnu, and French troops at Kum Kale, your 29th Division will be the spearhead here at Cape Helles.
Five landing sites have been selected in this area. The troops assigned to these beaches are as follows:
- 1/King's Own Scottish Borderers at "Y" Beach, supported by the Plymouth Battalion of the Royal Naval Division
- 2/Royal Fusiliers, 1/Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers and 1/Border Regiment at "X" beach
- 1/Lancashire Fusiliers and 4/Worcestershire Regiment at "W" beach
- 1/Royal Munster Fusiliers, 1/Royal Dublin Fusiliers and 2/Hampshire Regiment at "V" beach
- 2/South Wales Borderers and a detachment of sailors from HMS Cornwallis at "S" beach

We are expecting Turkish resistance to be light, exept at "V" beach where our troops have the task to overwhelm the garrison of the Sedd-El-Bahr fortress. Once you have secured the beaches, we will land additional troops and artillery. The French 1st Division is on its way and will join your advance up the peninsula. It is essential that you seize your objectives as quickly as possible - before the Turks are able to send reinforcements.

Good luck, General! God save the King!
