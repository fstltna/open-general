FRONTIER RAID June12 1940

Good morning Capitano. Welcome to the Libyan desert. You have been put in command of the Ridotta Capuzo garrison. These local garrison troops are part of the 38th Group Frontier Guards.

We picked up vague rumors of Mussolini having declared war on England and France. That is probably exaggerated, so make your stay in this sea of sand as comfortable as possible.

In case the English do decide to cross the 271km frontier wire - Graziani's wall - between Libya and Egypt, your orders are to hold on to your positions and harass their supply columns. That should force them to retreat back into Egypt. There is no need to rush into Egypt with your garrison forces. Our counterintelligence units report that the English have excellent recon information of your positions.

ORDERS
Capture all Victory hexes.
