The Nazi war machine stand at our gates, Comrade! And your fate is the defense of Dorpat. Hold the city as long as you can, a train with important war goods must pass your position before the city falls.

Note: Buy cheap Militia to block the German advance. 

Order: Protect the train, resist the German attack for 10 rounds and hold as much VHs as possible!
