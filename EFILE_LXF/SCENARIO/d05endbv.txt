BRILLIANT VICTORY

Very well done. You have held open the roads long enough for the Dutch troops at Batavia to retreat and to complete the destructions. However, Java cannot be held. The commander-in-chief of the Allied forces on Java, Luitenant-General Hein ter Poorten, has asked for a truce to the Japanese. The evacuation of as many as possible Allied forces has begun. 

AFTERMATH:
Your forces make it to a port on the southern coast of Java and get evacuated to Australia.  After some months of rest your force is tranported to Merauke on New Guinea. Merauke is the last part of the Dutch East Indies not in Japanese hands.
