Herr General,

It is only through the direct intervention of Marshall Rommel that the fuehrer did not fire you straight away. He seems to have somehow convinced him that attacking the paratroopers and thus allowing the allies to gain a large bridgehead in the south was your only option. In this way we gained a small victory but lost the Peloponese. 

Loehr wil now begin to regroup our forces and start a fighting retreat that will probably only end north of Thermopylae. We could off course try to keep the Corinth Canal,but that would expose us to naval gunfire, and be far to dangerous. It is rumoued that your troops, that are not needed in this strategy, will be transferred to France.
