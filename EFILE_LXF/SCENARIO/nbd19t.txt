Commander, it is only by pure luck that you survived the carnage at Tarawa. The Japanese have now reinforced Tarawa Atoll and the Marines, what are left of them, are headed back to Pearl Harbor.  They were plenty happy to send you back here to the Army.  Get your troops ready, we have another important mission for you.
