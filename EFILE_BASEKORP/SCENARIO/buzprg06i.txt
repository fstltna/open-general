Valley of Death

Part 2/7 of the "Commanding the Corps" minicampaign.

*****

At the end of October 1944 a narrow valley north of Slovak city Svidnik became a place of heavy fights that last for three days. This encounter was a part of Carpatho-Dukla operation; the dale became lately famous as a Valley of Death...

Intelligence and reconnaisance: German defenders turned the valley into a deadly trap. Try to get through the vale, but know that you face four infantry divisions supported by several artillery batteries and more then a dozen of armoured vehicles.

Reinforces: Soviet command sent two infantry regiments of the 70 Guards Rifle Division together with some tanks and mortars to aid to your cause. They'll show up tomorrow. (One turn is six hours, so...)

Hint: Luftwaffe is seriously depleted, but Soviet pilots have different tasks. Your airplanes will rule the skies...
