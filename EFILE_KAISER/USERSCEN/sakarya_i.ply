Battle of Sakarya 

August 23, 1921

The Greek army began its offensive on July 16, 1921, overcame the Turkish defense and took Eski Shehir the 17th. The Turks retreated with heavy losses to a position behind the Sakarya River, just 50 miles from Ankara, the Turkish capital.

The position of the Turkish army was strong, entrenched in hills behind the river. The Greek army should decide between entrench and defend the gains or advance towards Ankara to destroy the Turkish capital, thus extending its lines of communication and supply in hostile territory; after much deliberation they chose to attack.

The battle started the 23th of August, when Greek forces made contact with the Turksih defenses, and on August 26 they attacked all along the front.

You command the Turkish forces and you must stop the Greek offensive; their forces are more organized and trained, but your position is strong.
