DAS REICH v2.1 (for OpenGen AI v2.00)

The DAS REICH campaign puts you in control of the SS units known as SS-Division Verfuegungstruppe, SS-Division Das Reich, SS-Panzergrenadier-Division Das Reich and 2SS Panzer Division Das Reich. The division was one of the classic SS divisions that quickly earned a reputation for courage and bravery. 

The division's troops saw action in Poland, The Netherlands, Belgium, France, The Balkans, Russia, Normandy, The Ardennes, Hungary, Vienna and Prague. Expect a Blitzkrieg type of campaign with battalion size units.

A big thank you to Pzmaniac. His test results vastly inproved this version of the campaign.
