Situation report: Japanese forces have advanced from the north and now, by complete surprise, managed to cross onto the island bastion of Singapore. Now the defenses are threatened with complete collapse. Our only hope is to hold off the enemy until a solution to this situation can be discovered. The Royal Navy has promised to send a Battleship and a Battlecruiser to aid in the defense but it is not sure if any reinforcements can be brought in in time to save Singapore.

Operational orders: You will assist the Commonwealth forces in defending what remains of fortress Singapore. There is not much hope for your survival, but the entire free world prays for your salvation.

(Designer note: Sorry, you can't win this one either, but you will get another chance to prove your mettle by fighting to the bitter end.)


[HD note: Victory conditions changed to make use of OpenGeneral's "Typed VH" victory conditions; a loss though is still highly probable.]
