We have entered Kijów without any serious trouble. Very well done!
But, confidentially, I must tell you that the situation is far worse than we expected. Although Symon Petliura thought that there would be a Ukrainian patriotic uprising against the Russians, most of the population is indifferent at best. We won't have any strong support from the locals.

And even worse than this, our intelligence reports warn us of a huge Red counteroffensive that will start in the next few weeks or possibly in a few days! We are very far from our bases and the Soviet reinforcements will be composed mainly of veteran troops so we could be in serious trouble.
