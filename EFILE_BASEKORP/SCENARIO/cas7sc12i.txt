A week ago, Yugoslavia was close to signing the Dreimaechtepakt - and become one of our allies, and yesterday they actually signed the agreement. However, rumour has it that there has been a coup d'etat by the military, who are against this agreement. Therefore we must use the current confusion to invade the country. We cannot have an army one million strong in our rear! Move swiftly the enemy forces grow stronger by the day!
