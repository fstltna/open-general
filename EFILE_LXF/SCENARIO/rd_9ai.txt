Comrade General, the time has finally come.  Over a year has passed since the Allies fled Europe from the city of Dunkirk, and now our carefully made plans are going into action.  

Your decorated forces have been specially chosen by comrade Stalin himself to land on the British mainland and secure the beaches at Dover. While the British troops outnumber us almost two-to-one, the majority of them are inexperienced recruits.  The Free French and German troops we expect you to encounter are more experienced but far fewer in number.  

Submarines have been sent to neutralize the British ships in the area, an assigment of which I am sure they shall have no trouble with. 

Task Force Bear is landing to the west of your position, in order to secure one of the airfields located along the shore. 

There is a rumor that an experienced British force is being sent to reinforce the area within several days.  It would be in your best interest to secure the coast of Dover as quickly as possible.  Good luck, comrade General.
