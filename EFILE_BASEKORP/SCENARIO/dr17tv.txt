Rzhev-Vyazma Operation - Februari 1942 TV

After the Russian 39rd Army, 29th Army and the 11th Cavalry Corps, now also some troops of the 33rd Army are encircled. Altough we expected more from you in this battle, you have stopped the Russian Winter offensive. Congratulations. 
A Kamfgruppe of your division will stay on the Eastern front until June 1st, but you are ordered to move to France to prepare the reorganization of Das Reich into a Panzer-Grenadier division.
