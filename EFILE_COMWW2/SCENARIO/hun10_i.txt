Romanians followed their well-known historical tradition and changed sides. The situation is critical, the Hungarian and German armies deployed in Northern Transylvania can be easily encircled. OKW made a plan to retake Southern Transylvania. The 4th German Army will attack in Bánát in the direction of Temesvár (Timisoara). Your order is to secure Maros valley. Take the key city Arad and move as far as you can.

HQ has approved the expansion of your forces to include an armored detachment.

NOTE: You have 30 DHs. Hold 6 VHs for BV/DV, 5 for V and 4 for TV/MV.
