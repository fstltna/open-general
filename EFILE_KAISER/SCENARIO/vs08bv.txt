First Ypres - La Bassee - October 1914 BV

The French Army has been pushed asside, but it looks like the whole BEF - including a new 4th Corps - has been bussed in from the Aisne and is plugging the holes in the front.

Your division and the other divisions of HKK I and II will be relieved by the 13th and 14th ID of the 6th Armee. Move your troops North to support HKK IV near Messines - just South of Ypres.
