Marshall!  Thankyou for your peaceful surrender.

Northern Italy is already being occupied by Nazi troops, you must cooperate with my intelligence officer to help my Allied forces advance as far north as possible before making contact with the German Army.

We have accepted peace through formal surrender of Italy, and we are now focused on keeping the Germans from turning Italy into a war zone.  If the Germans get a good foothold, we could fight among your mountains for years!

If you want to save Italy from the destruction that Germany is soon to suffer, you must cooperate with us!

Now, where are the supply and transportation systems still functioning so the Allied forces can move rapidly north.........
