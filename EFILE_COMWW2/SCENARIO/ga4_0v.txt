Good work comrade Lieutenant-General. Most of the Japanese forces have been wiped out, the remainder being either caught behind our lines of advance or pushed back into Manchukuo. Now the Japanese have asked for an armistice, and they agree to abide by the existing border! Congratulations, you have been awarded the title of "Hero of the Soviet Union", promoted to General of the Army, and have been given command of the Kiev Special Military District!
