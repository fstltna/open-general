THE BENGHAZI HANDICAP April6 1941

The Western Desert Force is on the run. It was clear soon to the Australians that it was impossible to hold Benghazi. 

Rommel is moving 8MG Btn to Derna to try and cut off the retreating Brits and Australians. They will be joined by half of the Brescia division that is moving East along the coastal road. The remainder of our forces must strengthen the troops surrounding the 3rd Motorized Indian Brigade at Mechili.
