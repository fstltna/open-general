Message from General Fernández Silvestre's HQ:

Your advance was slower than we expected, but at least you could force El Raisuli to retreat. Maybe his defeat will finally convince him that he'd better see Spain as an ally not an enemy. At least, I hope that. El Raisuli's cooperation would make our tasks in Morocco much easier.

I think you should take a rest, General. A leave would do you good and I'm sure that we won't have much enemy activity for some time.
