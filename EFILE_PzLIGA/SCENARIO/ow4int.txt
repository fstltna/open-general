Kristiansand

Your troops have traveled from Oslo to the important city of Kristiansand, where they will help the dissembark of gruppe 4, commanded by the Captain Friedrich Rieve. Kriegsmarine important ships will aid your drive on Kristiansand. There are some norvegian ships in the area too, we think they won't be a serious problem. Your troops will take some points in the mountains, in order to avoid the arrive of allied reinforments to the norvegians.
