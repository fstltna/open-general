[The Supreme druid approaches towards you:] 

A great victory!
.... Decimus Brutus is dead, and their standards lie in the dust .....
.... but Pompeius Magnus was able to escape ....

You should think that this defeat would have broken Rome's neck ... but there is one thing we have to appreciate about these crazy Romans: They are incredibly tough ...

... already our spies report, that they have elected two new consuls and already conscript new legions ...
Besides, they have ordered back their most experienced legions from all parts of their empire...
