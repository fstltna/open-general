We have saved the trapped divisions!  We have also stabilised the Army Group South's frontline.  Once again the LSSAH have proven themselves to be the most elite troops of the Waffen SS.

(Historical note:  After the failure to save the trapped divisions the Leibstandarte itself was encircled at Kamenets-Podolski.  The casualties were horrendous.  Only 1,250 men remained.  The remnants were able to fight their way out west back to German lines.  The divisions would soon be in Belgium to await the Allied landings in France.)
