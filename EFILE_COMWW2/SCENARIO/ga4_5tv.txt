Well done comrade Zhukov.  Although the Germans still hold the Sinyavino heights, under your leadership and guidance, the fronts have met, and thus a land corridor has been opened into Leningrad! The city is still partially under siege, but emergency supply trucks are entering Leningrad as we speak, carrying much needed food and supplies. Once this second " Road of Life" is finished being constructed within the liberated corridor, Leningrad should be able to be supplied with all necessities until the Siege can be completely lifted. Congratulations, you have been promoted to Marshal of the Soviet Union!
