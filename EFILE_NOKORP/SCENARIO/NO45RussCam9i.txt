All right, the first snow has arrived, and it will only get worse from now on. The Russians know that.

High Command has decided to push eastwards till we hit something important and break the Russians' will to fight. Your troops will lead the spearhead.
It will have to be done quickly, for there are many thousands of kilometers in front of us and winter is at our door, not to mention our supply lines can't keep up anymore: We use supplies more quickly than we can bring them from Germany, which means we will need to get this done before our supply stock runs out. Believe me, you do not want to have to live off this land, with ammunition and fuel in short supply!


Your mission is to take this important industrial city. Our Intelligence tells us some important armament factories are there, as well as a strategic fuel depot. Your mission is to destroy the factories and the fuel depot. Yes, we're short on fuel, but the Soviets use Diesel and our tanks can't use that.
Beware, that city has a strong garrison. Also 2 complete tank divisions have been spotted in the vicinity. It will be a hard fight, getting even harder if the soviet tanks arrive before you've finished taking the city. Hurry up!

To make things easier, High Command allocated you one of those new America Bombers made by Horten. They look funny, but I've been told they are extremely efficient and can even stand their own as fighters.



Instructions: Capture VHs, destroy all MSUs. You get some new core units.
Turn Prestige will soon start getting low, so don't forget to "live off the land", ie. capture as many nation hexes you can...
