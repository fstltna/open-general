However, Cambrai has proved that a surprise artillery-infantry attack supported by new methods and weapons can destroy even the strongest of our lines of defense.

The good news are that, on one hand, an armistice with the Bolshevik Russians is imminent, and on the other hand, the United States are still a neutral country. Our decision to reject the unrestricted submarine warfare in order to starve out Britain has been a very hard one, but the resuts have been good.
