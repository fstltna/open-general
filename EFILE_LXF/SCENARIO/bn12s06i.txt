
BATAAN - 4 APR 1942

Bataan Peninsula, Philippines
CO General Masaharu Homma

The Army has trouble to break through the Filipino-American defenses on Bataan. Despite massive artillery concentration, the forces are not capable of perform the deciding strike to end the Philippine campaign. With your support the thing should now come back to move. A part of your force attacks and take the offshore island of Corregidor. The rest of your men should support the Army on Bataan when breaking through the fortified positions.

Keep your ships from range or sight of the strong coastal artillery on Corregidor and deploy your aircraft carrier to the east of Bataan, so your air force can immediately intervene in the fight.

GOAL: Take all VHs!


BACKGROUND

The Battle of Bataan represented the most intense phase of Imperial Japan's invasion of the Philippines during World War II. The capture of the Philippine Islands was crucial to Japan's effort to control the Southwest Pacific, seize the resource-rich Dutch East Indies, and protect its Southeast Asia flank. It was the largest surrender in American and Filipino military history, and was the largest United States surrender since the Civil War's Battle of Harper's Ferry.
