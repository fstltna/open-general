Sino-French War - Lang Son - February, 1885 - V

A masterful performance. The Chinese are fleeing Tonkin, running for their lives, and leaving their best equipment behind. They might recover their courage once they cross the border, but it doesn't really matter. One way or another, Tonkin will become a French protectorate, just like Annam, and it'll join our other territories in Indochina. 

HISTORICAL EVENTS:
1885-FEB-13. French forces take Lang Son, after a march of 10 days and several engagements against Chinese forces.
1885-FEB-23. The French defeat the Qing army at Dong Dang, forcing it to retreat towards the Chinese border.
1885-FEB-25. The French take the Zhennan Pass, but most of the army goes back to Lang Son, leaving just a small force on the mountain passes.
1885-MAR-24. The Qing army defeats the French troops that were defending the Zhennan Pass (battle of Bang Bo).
1885-MAR-28. Fearing a Chinese counterattack, the French evacuate Lang Son.
1885-MAR-30. When the news of the French retreats reached Paris, there were riots in the streets. The laicist-colonialist government of Jules Ferry fell, and his successor promptly ordered to sign a peace treaty with China.
1885-APR-04. Hostilities are ended.
1885-JUN-09. France and China sign the Treaty of Tientsin. China recognises the French protectorate over Annam and Tonkin, but at least doesn't have to pay any war reparations. From the Chinese point of view the war had been fought to a stalemate, and that had an outstanding effect on the rebirth of China's national pride.
