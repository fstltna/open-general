Introduccion a Kosovo offensive - Pristina

November 20th, 1915

The Serbian Army has been defeated at all fronts, and now its remnants have retreated to Kosovo, where they hope to resist until help comes. But their fate will be surrender or destruction. Right now, we can attack them from all sides but the west: You will lead our First Army from the Morava Valley in the northeast. Some units of the German 11th Army will advance from the north and, after liberating Macedonia, some units of our Second Army will attack from the South. Very soon, Serbia will be doomed.
The enemy knows that, so they won't be sitting down odly waiting for our troops. We think that they will try to delay your march, while their best troops try a final counterattack in the south, in the hope of opening a corridor in Macedonia that allows them to receive help from the French and British troops that have disembarked in Greece. But if you advance quickly enough, all of their efforts will be useless. Good luck!

Victory conditions: Take all VHs.
