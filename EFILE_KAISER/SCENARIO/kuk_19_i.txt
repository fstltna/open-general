Unternehmen Radowitz (II): Florenz

Jul 14th, 1918

Now that Verona and Vicenza are firmly under our control, we must start the second phase of our invasion of Italy. In the east the Germans are going to take the valley of the Po, isolating Venedig from the rest of the country, and trapping most of the Italian army between the rivers Piave and Po. 

At the same time, you'll cross the Apennin and take Florenz. We think that the fighting will be tough. The region is being defended by the Italian 7th Army, a bunch of veterans who know that they're the last obstacles that you'll have to face before conquering central Italy. When Florenz falls, we'll control the main roads and railroads that lead to Rom, and Italy will be doomed. Our enemies know that, and they'll do everything they can in order to stop you. Be careful, General, and good luck!

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.

Special note: 
- You can buy Bulgarian equipment in this scenario.
