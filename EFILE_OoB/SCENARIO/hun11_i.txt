October 10, 1944

A Soviet Mechanized Group under the command of Issa Pliyev defeated the untested Hungarian 3rd Army in September. Now they are advancing toward Debrecen and Nyíregyháza and try to cut off completely the 8th German and 2nd Hungarian Armies. Bolsheviks don't expect any serious counterattack and left their flanks relatively lightly defended. General Fretter-Pico ordered the German 1st and 13th Panzer Division to encircle advancing Red troops. Go and help them, General!
