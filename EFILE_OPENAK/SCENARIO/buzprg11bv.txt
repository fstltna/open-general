Ostrava was liberated in the evening of 30th April 1945, when tanks crossed the bridge across Ostravice. This bridge was undermined, but a young man Emil (Milos) Sykora with his friend nicknamed "Olsak" warned the tankists of the explosives . Subsequently they cut the wires, but Sykora was mortally wounded by German machinegun fire from the opposite river bank. Olsak, wounded in a grenade explosion on the 1st May, died few days later in city's hospital.

There are also other versions of how the river crossing happened, it is said that it were the Germans themselves, who saved the bridge in exchange for a fair treatment. What really happened? Who knows? Bridge over Ostravice bears Sykora's name today and it is hard to argue about his and Olsak's bravery...

At the beginning of May 1945 a revolutionary wave ran through the Czech lands, similar to the one that ran through other European countries that were approached by the Allied armies. Yet the situation in Protectorate was a bit different due to the pre-war situation. There were very little weapons amongst the people, instead there were some one million German soldiers spread through the land. But once the fire was ignited, it couldn't be quenched easily. During the first days of May a nationwide uprising started. There's a one last mission before you. Liberate the Czech capital and finish your road from Buzuluk to Prague.
