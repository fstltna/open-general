10. NOVOROSSIYSK 1 (20 September 1942)

The fascist has started his summer offensive. We expected the fascists to strike against Moskva, our capitol, but they have attacked in the south. Within weeks they had reached the Don River and Stalingrad on the Volga River. Even more south, Rostov has once again switched hands, the oilfields of Maikop have fallen, and German and Rumanian forces poured into the steppes south of Rostov, leading to the Causasus mountains with the valuable oil. A week ago the enemy has taken the Black Sea port of Novorossiyk and if we fail to stop the enemy at the coastal road, other ports will soon be under enemy control as well. 

Your forces must stop the enemy advance down south on the coastal road. Although the recapture of Novorriysk is beyond our limits, you are ordered to contain the German attack and retake several positions in the hills. Good luck, comrade.
