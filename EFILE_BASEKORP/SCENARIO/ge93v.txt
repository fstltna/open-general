Herr General, Kishinev is secure. German and Romanian troops are occupying the Ukraine.  This victory is worthy of great praise.  The Bolshevik's have sued for peace!  The independence of Bylorussian and the Ukraine under German protection will stabilize our Eastern borders.  Now it only remains to force the Western Allies to the peace table.
