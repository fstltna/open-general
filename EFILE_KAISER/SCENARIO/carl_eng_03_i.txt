Siege of Bilbao

April 27th, 1874

This year is not being a good one for us. In January, General Pavia dissolved the Parliament in Madrid, and the new provisional republican government has put the chaos within part of the liberal army to an end. We began the siege of Bilbao in February, and after more than two months we have not achieved any of our goals. The city still resists, our generals Rada and Ollo have died, and we have barely rejected the liberal attempts to lift the siege in the Somorrostro area.
The enemy, that outnumbers us, has just released their third offensive to relieve Bilbao. Unfortunately our High Command, convinced that the main assault would occur in Valmaseda further south, neglected the defenses in the rest of the line. Right now the front is broken and the liberals are about to lift the siege of the city. Your troops are the only reserves that we have. Prepare a counterattack and reject the liberal offensive. If possible, also arrange an assault to make Bilbao fall.

Victory: Take all the VHs.

Notes: With a BV or a V, in the following scenarios you will fight for a fictitional Carlist victory. With a TV or defeat, you will follow the historical scenarios.

- The unit that enters Somorrostro will win +100 pex.
