Herr General,

We are taking measures to make the American public sick of this war. We started a big offensive towards Liege and get in the back of the American 1st and 9th armies near Aachen.

Now that the Americans are off-balance, you are to attack in Alsace, conquer Strassbourg and generally inflict heavy casualties on the Americans. The 17th SS has already moved from Metz and is also at your disposal.
