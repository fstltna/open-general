02. TARAKAN (12 January 1942)

STRATEGIC REPORT:
Our home country is lost and on December 7th Japanese forces have attacked the American base of Pearl Harbor. Australia, England, the Netherlands and the US have declared war upon Japan. The Allies are losing on all fronts. Hong Kong has fallen and Singapore and the Philipines are under attack too. The Japanese have begun invading our Dutch East Indies as well. Tarakan is one of their initial targets. Tarakan is important because of the oil found there. Your force is the only Dutch force present. The oilfields are being blown up to prevent use from the Japanese in the near future. You must hold the Japanese down long enough to accomplish the destructions. You will then get evacuated.

TACTICAL ORDERS:
The Japanese have landed their Sakaguchi Detachment along with special forces at the east coast of Tarakan where we did not expected them. Japanese forces might land in the more suitable coast in the west too. You will face an experienced and determined enemy. Counterattack immediately to slow the Japanese conquest down so that all destructions can be completed. Good luck.
