December, 13., 1862 Fredericksburg


Dear Friend, this night we reached the city of Fredericksburg. The confederates had destroyed all bridges across Rappahannock River. Our sappers were busy building ponton bridges instead. We have been ordered to cross the river and attack the confederate positions on the heights west of Fredericksburg and the railway. 
This mission seems to be insane!

ORDERS:
Congratulations Sir, we received a message from President Lincoln and the Army Headquaters and you will be promoted to Major General! Due to the reorganisation of the Army of the Potamac, you will command our new formed corps. Four regiments of colored soldiers will be attached to your core units.
....Cross the river and take the heights...!

ADVICE FROM YOUR OLDEST SERGEANT:
A direct attack seems to be suicide but maybe we should remember Franz Sigel's favorite tactic and send the Cavalry far away to one of the flanks!

HISTORICAL NOTE:
The colored infantry regiments which join your core did not take part at the historic Battle of Fredericksburg or were established later but have been implemented at this point of the campaign for a better core development.
