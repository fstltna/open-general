12. LEROS (11 November 1943)

TO: Generaladmiral
SUBJECT: Occupation of Leros

---In September Italy has betrayed us and surrendered to the Allies. However the Army was able to occupy Italy and the Italian occupation zones before the Allies could make use of the situation. In the Aegian Sea, however, there are still a number of Greek islands in Italian control. Leros is one of them, and British forces have landed on it. This cannot be tolerated and we will capture Leros!

The Italian garrison has joined the British Expedionary Force. Leros poses a serious fortification and the British Royal Navy is also present. Your flotilla is once again the German main force. You will be supported by the Luftwaffe and Fallschirmjaeger.---
