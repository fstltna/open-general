Very well done!  You have have a date in Berlin.  The Fuehrer himself wishes to congratulate you.  Despite the fact the Americans have managed to force their way inland at St. Laurent and St. Martin de Varreville, you have bought our forces some valuable time to prepare for what will become a long and hard campaign.  We will make sure the Allies pay in blood for every inch of ground they move forward.

If we can show them that the price is too high, perhaps we may yet salvage something from this disaster.  Please do not repeat those words to anyone...
