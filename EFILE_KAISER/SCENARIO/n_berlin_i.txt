there is little support announced for both sides ..

Historical :
In reality, everything went bloodless. After the revolt in Kiel, Wilhelmshaven and other towns the USPD planned in Berlin mass demonstrations and a general strike for the 9th November 1918 . This was heard by the competing SPD under leadership of its chairman, Friedrich Ebert.

In order to remain master of the situation, 

To anticipate the USPD, Ebert forced Chancellor Max von Baden to announce the abdication of Wilhelm II. 
The Kaiser was this time at Spa, where the allied armistice terms had been previously negotiated. He then fled to his Dutch exile where he signed the abdication on 28.11.1919.
