Just three days after the Prussian assault on Missunde the Danish Commander in Chief, General de Meza, withdrew all his forces from the Danevirke to the trenches at Düppel. Since the weather was terribly cold, the Schlei and the wetlands had frozen solid, and de Meza feared that, under those conditions, his army could be outflanked.

Although almost all of the Danish army succeeded in completing the evacuation, the Danes had lo leave many artillery pieces behind, and lost their best defence positions without any serious fighting. Seeing the evacuation as a failure, de Meza was relieved of his command.
