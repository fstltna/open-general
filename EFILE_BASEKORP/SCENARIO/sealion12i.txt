Orkney

Orders:

While most of the british forces and fleet have been evacuated to Canada some units still are operating from Scapa Flow and cover the main force's withdrawl. You have to take Scapa Flow and the Orkney Islands. We will turn the islands into our new home base for the Kriegsmarine North Atlantic service.

Note: 

It is possible to deploy planes at the axis flagged hex. This hex simulates a flight path / approach corridor of planes taking off from airports in Scotland.
