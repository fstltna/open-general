Changkufeng Incident

July, 1938

Good morning commander.  Have you enjoyed the past months here in Korea?  Well I'm going to explain your new orders from Tokyo... yes, the vacation is over.  You and your men will go to the Russo-Korean border... yes you have guessed it, the plans are to make a little ''attack'' on the strategic ''Zaozernaya'' and ''Bogomolnaya'' hills located on the East side of the border, not far from the Khasan lake.  These hills are claimed by Tokyo, and of course they should be ours!  The borders are only protected by some poorly equipped border guards, but surely the Soviet Far East command will react quickly by sending troops to halt our assault.  If we can resist the soviet counterattack, the hills and other strategic positions will remain under the Rising Sun flag.

Good luck!
