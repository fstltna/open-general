Orders:

Yesterday, on the 8th September 1943, the Armistice of Cassibile was made public and Italy surrendered. The Armistice was already signed on 3rd September between the Kingdom of Italy and the Allies in Cassibile on Sicily. German forces started to disamrm the itlaien and occupy all of Italy.

Sir, this is the situiation at the moment and the allied command had already planned to carry out simultaneous operations Near Salerno and Taranto. The British 1st Airborne Division will head for Taranto while a large combined force is going to make landfall near Salerno. We hop to cut off German forces in southern Italy. 

The British X.Corps will occupy the northern landing ground near Salerno and you, Sir, will take command about the forces that will head for the southern landing ground between Paestrum and the airfield near Battipaglia.

Note:

The landings will carried out without previous aerial bombardment in order to achieve surprise. This time your forces will start without an airport. You have to build or capture one. Two airborne regiments are held back as reserve and might arrive later if needed.

Hint:

Units with [Z] special ability can build airfields in 2 turns and with the "fast builder" attachment in just 1 turn. Building an airport costs 20pp.
