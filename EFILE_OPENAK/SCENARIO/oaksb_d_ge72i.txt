Herr Feldmarschall, due to your unprecedented advance, we will soon see the triumphant finish of our Southern campaign.  Feldmarschall von Manstein's Army Group North is within 100 kilometers of Knoxville, and .....  excuse me, Herr Feldmarschall .....           Herr Feldmarschall, I have just received information of the most critical importance. Less than 20 kilometers north of us, here, is a large facility. Intelligence reports indicate that the Americans are building a weapon of terrifying explosive power there. It is imperative that we act decisively and destroy this facility.

Note:  New units and prototypes start this scenario with 150 experience points.
