We expected more of you, General. A bunch of mountain shepherds has ridiculed you. Your performance was very disappointing. 

Anyway, we'll use our reserves and we'll eventually overcome the Montenegrins. Their army is small, and they won't receive any reinforcements. They can't resist much longer.

Soon we'll occupy most of Albania. However, no matter how much we hurry, many Serbian soldiers will have enough time to embark on the coast, and they'll leave for Corfu or Greece. It doesn't matter. This has been our finest victory since the war started. Serbia has been destroyed, we control most of the Balkans, and the Bulgarians are strong enough to do most of the future fighting in this area. Now we can focus on the Eastern front, and on the war against Italy. Redeem yourself there.
