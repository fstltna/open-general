Herr General, the British on Crete have been a hindrance to our operations in the eastern Mediteranian.  The General staff has decided to eliminate this annoyance.  Since your troops are already in Greece, and our 1942 Russian campaign will wait for good spring weather, you have been chosen to lead this operation.
