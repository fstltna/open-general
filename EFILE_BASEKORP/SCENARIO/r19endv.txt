VICTORY

The Kuban steppes and the Taman peninsula are liberated. Not one fascist still stands in its soil. Well done, comrade. Elsewhere our forces are having victories as well. In the Ukraine our offensive is steaming towards the Dnjepr River. And the winter has still to begin! However your forces will be drawn back, and receive some badly needed rest and refitting. But the enemy is far from defeated so you will face them again.
