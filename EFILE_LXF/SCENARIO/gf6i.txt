The Channel Dash - February 12th, 1942

The 5 capital ships now docked at Brest are vulnarable to British air attacks. The plan is to move the ships to Norway, where they are safer and can be used to deter an Allied invasion and harass Allied convoys to the Soviet Union. 

The battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau have been added to your command. Bring the five capital ships through the Channel.
