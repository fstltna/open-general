   "Til Moscow is Ours"  1/22/42
  The Fuhress made the statement to Lennigrad Commander SS Frau General Elfi Hostenferrgloss.Elfi knew She was in Stalins bullseye,He was determined to have Leningrad back in Soviet hands.Meetings in the War Cabinet would most likely include Lennigrad being mentioned,troops to be reinforced in the area and the immense supplies allocated for them.Ground in the area was gained very slow moving to Moscow compared to the Center and South Fronts and don't think the Frau Commanders in charge did not stress that point to the Fuhress.Of course the War Cabinet realized 'Elfi's Front sooner or later had to 'Break one way or the other.Recruits heading to the Conflicts now hearing the word Lennigrad just hoped that wasn't their assigned destination.These Reports started to get back to Berlin.So Lennigrad would have to start to get the biggest majority of the Fraulands new equipment to counter the morale problems that were rising.New Panzers formed SS Panzer Gruppe 'Elfi and an attack on the 51st Shock Army 47 kilometers east of Lennigrad would be made at a unmapped town know as Gorznoki before the Soviets moved first.On the flank of the 51st was 'Helmonchek's 10th Guards.Hopefully the Air Korps could keep them stifled to not intercede trapping PZ Gp 'Elfi.
