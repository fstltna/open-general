BRILLIANT VICTORY

Excellent, comrade. There were serious fights happening in the streets of Bucharest until you arrived and restored law and order. Proletarian law and order! The fascists are almost as good as driven out of Rumania and now the Rumanian Army is fighting alongside us against the Germans and Hungarians.
