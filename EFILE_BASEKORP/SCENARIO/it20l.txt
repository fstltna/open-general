FIRST EL ALAMEIN July 1942 L

It was clear from the start that breaking through the line at El Alamein was going to be near imposible. Our absolute last reserves and the first troops of the 164Le division arriving at the front where required to counter the arrival of the 9th Australian Division and its attacks out of the El Alamein box. If it wasn't for the 164Le, we'd be back in the Cyrenaica by now. 

Prepare for a new attack as soon as your troops are rested. We need to break through the enemy lines before big reinforcements reach 8th Army early September.
