Message from General Gómez Jordana's HQ:

Well, you have certainly achieved a victory, but many Anyera rebels had enough time to hide. The rebellion still goes on, and it's a matter of time that the Anyera start to trouble us once more. Anyway, your victory will make easier for us to plan more ambitious operations in the future.
