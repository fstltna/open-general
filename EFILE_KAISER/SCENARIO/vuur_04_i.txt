Colesberg

January 9th, 1900

After your past battles against Lord Methuen it's surprising that General Cronjé has sent you to a secondary front like this. I guess that he doesn't want to share the glory of conquering Kimberley with anyone else, but I hope that he knows what he's doing. General Roberts is marching north with two British divisions, and he's determined to relieve Kimberley and destroy our commandoes.

Besides, glory may have followed you to Colesberg. This is a small town, but with a great strategic importance. It's located on the main road from Kaapstad to Johannesburg, so now that the Rooineks have decided to invade our land, all their main supply lines will cross this area. If you manage to disrupt them, sending reinforcements to Roberts will be very difficult for our enemies.

The Kakies know this, so Roberts has sent General French to this area, with one cavalry division and at least one infantry brigade. For the moment French has settled for small raids and skirmishes. It's pretty clear that he just wanted to divert as many Boer soldiers from Kimberley as he could. However in the last days he has extended his lines to the east and north, trying to outflank us before his final assault.

If you manage to win a decisive victory over French, maybe you could clear Colesberg of enemies, cut their supply lines, and go back in time for helping Cronjé...if you want to. You've fought well in the past, so why should it be different now?

Victory conditions:
- Take all the VHs.
- Your MSU core unit must survive.
