Our glorious leader Kim Il-sung sends his highest congratulations, Comrade General!  You have stopped the capitalist advance short of the Yalu River.  The imperialist armies are short on supplies and soon a Chinese counteroffensive will destroy them while we rebuild our army to fight another day!

Follow me, Comrade General; I will inform you of your next mission.  Yes, that is right. Your men will get rest and new equipment, but we have a new assignment for you while your force is refitting!
