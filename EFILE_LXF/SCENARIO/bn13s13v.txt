VICTORY

Excellent, mon General. The Germans has the most severe difficulties with the cracking the weakest sector of the Maginot Line. Some positions the enemy could not even take! However at a number of places the Germans have broken through and threaten to encircle the troops on other places. You have orders to fall back in order to hold cohesion in the frontline.
