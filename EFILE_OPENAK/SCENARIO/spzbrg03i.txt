Line on Bug

Part 4/4 of the "Blitzkrieg" minicampaign.


"Hauptmann! Hauptmann Bistroff! Turn off the engine! Gott in Himmel! Turn off the bloody engine! I can't shout, my throat hurts like thousand needles!

Listen, the brigade rode right into the enemy defense! The line is strengthened by machine guns and they have an artillery and tank support. Cavarly can't get through, in fact they were maybe routed as we speak.

I don't know if the Soviets are already in the area, but I can tell you for sure that it will be us, not them, who will welcome the others. Do you understand? I need your tankists to breach the Polish line immediatelly! After all, it is their one last defensive line and it shouldn't... Shut up Ebersbach! So, this is their last... What?! Soviet airplanes? Have you heard it, Bistroff? Move on! Start moving that tin shack of yours!"


Victory conditions: Capture all VHs.

Hint: Our airplanes are about to join the battle. Soviet auxiliaries will come from the east, too, but not sooner than in few hours.

Warning: Next minicampaign takes place in Scandinavia and thus the upgrade choices will be limited a bit.
