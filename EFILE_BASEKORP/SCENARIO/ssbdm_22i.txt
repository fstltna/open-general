  Frau Major Magla came into the Command building, "General Cupps,Russian armor is pouring through the ranks,100's of tanks and not those small ones but those KV's we've been having trouble with"."You didn't believe that garbage from Berlin did You?The 'Russian Bear' running back to Moscow for some of Stalins Tit.I wish the Reich Propaganda Ministry under Frau Teufel would stay out of the War.I see Fraus running around with too many smiles on their faces.The Soviets are not going to Fold cause We captured the land on the Frontiers and their Grand city of Leningrad.I Myself believe the Fuhress has bit off more than We All can chew and We will be lucky to win this War and keep Russian boots out of Berlin.Last weeks downpour stifling all movement of the Heavy stuff should wake everyone up but I see those redeployment Orders from Berlin are still pouring in".Moments later the Air-raid sirens went off and the officers moved to the basement.The building rocked from the bombs."Magla when We go back up You get over to the airfield and chew out Commander Schellem,that Silly Bitch boasting how We got control of the Skies as far as the Eye can see.Runner come here.Go tell Frau 'Lungerhausen to move the 9th SS to the East of grid 31 and prepare for Heavies".
