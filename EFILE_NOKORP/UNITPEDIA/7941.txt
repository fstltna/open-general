Siege Howitzer, small house-sized. 
It was developed before WWII, 8 were built. It saw service in the Battle of France and spent the rest of the war on the Eastern Front.
It operated mounted on a firing platform and disassembled into six loads for transport. Each load was towed by a Sd.Kfz. 9 half-track, while a seventh half-track towed the gantry crane required to assemble the weapon.

It fired a half-ton concrete-piercing shell at 20 km.
