00. ALMERIA (31 May 1937)

TO: Korvettenkapitaen
SUBJECT: Retaliation at Almeria

---In the midst of the Spanish Civil War our proud Kriegsmarine has delivered a number of vessels to protect the Spanish coasts from war material brought in to either sides. Days ago the KM "Deutschland" was bombed in the harbour of Palma by Republican aircraft. This cannot be forgotten. We will strike back and bring severe damage to the Republican port of Almeria. 

You have been given command over a new flotilla with the KM "Admiral Scheer" as flagship. The Fuhrer has given orders for the build up of a Kriegsmarine Korps. These Marines will be elite units specially trained in amphibious warfare. They will be escorted by two torpedoboats. 

Your mission is to attack the port of Almeria and destroy the coastal guns in the fortress and do as much damage as possible. The Marines will land and complete the destructions in the city.---

NOTE: Losses of core ships can very difficulty be replaced. So be careful with them. Ships can be bough and upgraded during the campaign.
