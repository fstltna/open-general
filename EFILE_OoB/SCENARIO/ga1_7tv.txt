Historical Note: On August 14, the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division set out again to take Falaise. It's ruins finally fell on August 17. Meanwhile, the 4th Canadian and the 1st Polish Armoured Divisions hurried to block the German line of retreat just east of the town. As American and Free French forces sped from the south toward Argentan and Chambois, the 4th Canadian Armoured occupied Trun from the north. While the division prepared a line of defence along the Falaise-Trun-Chambois highway to bar the Germans from breaking out of the pocket, most of the 1st Polish Armoured took up position further east to head off the imminent enemy attempt to break in and extricate their comrades. The rest of it drove on to Chambois and there joined forces with American troops. The Falaise Gap was as good as closed at last..
