Keren - Sep 9th, 1917

"The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way, but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness"
Prov. 11, 5

The Conference of Kasala was a trap from the very beginning. Italy didn't want to negotiate anything, and just repeated a series of absurd demands: the complete demilitarization of Ethiopian Tigray, and the cessation of all our plans for modernizing our army and establishing permanent military agreements with other countries.

If we accepted that, for fear of the British reaction, we would become a puppet of the Italians. It was obvious that's what they were expecting from the start, and the supposed British impartial mediators just acted as reluctant Italian agents. Now we know that Italy had threatened Britain with negotiating a separate peace with Austria and Germany, and that was something that the Entente couldn't afford. We were doomed even before the start of the peace talks at Kasala.

That wasn't the first time that the Europeans had tried to deceive us. They had done the same to Yohannes IV with the Treaty of Adwa, and to Menelik II with the Treaty of Wuchale. This third time, we were ready to hit them first. The very same day that the Conference of Kasala ended, I launched a surprise attack against the Italian defences at the pass of Keren.

Victory conditions: 
Take all the VHs.
