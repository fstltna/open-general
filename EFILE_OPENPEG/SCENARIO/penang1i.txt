Penang, Malayasia
The port of George Town (Penang), situated on the western coast of the Malay Peninsula, is critical as a supply line for our shipping which to avoid the dangerous passage across the South China Sea. The retreating People's Liberation Army is, however, laying in wait along the only roads through the rough terrain. You will need to guard against exposing your command to ambush. An attachment of Australian troops are assigned to assist your advance. You must quickly recapture George Town and secure our flank east of the Rai River before the Chinese can relieve their faltering army.
