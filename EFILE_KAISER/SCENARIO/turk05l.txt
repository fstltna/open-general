Çatalca line - Loss

You couldn't stop the Bulgarian offensive. Now, even Istambul is in danger. Fortunately, you are among the many Ottoman casualties, so you won't live to see the fall of your empire.

Historical outcome
This was the only major Ottoman victory of the First Balkan War. Concentrating their artillery fire, the Turks could easily repel the Bulgarian frontal attacks, and they finally had to give up their offensive. Peace negotiations started soon and, although in March 1913 the war resumed for a few weeks, there were only small military actions until the Treaty of London ended the war on 30th May 1913. 
However, peace conditions were very hard on the Ottoman Empire: They lost all their remaining territories in Europe, except the tiny strip of land located east of the line between Enos and Midia, which included Istambul. Tensions beween the allies started almost inmediately, since Bulgaria asked for more formerly Ottoman lands than Serbia and Greece were willingl to cede, and on 29th June 1913 the Second Balkan War started when Bulgaria attacked her former allies.
