Gospodin General-Leitenant, you have failed to hold the German advance effectively at Novogeorgievsk.  As you abandoned the fortress in haste - and without regard to your comrades still in the trenches - your retreat resembled the fate of the Austrian armies in the fall of 1914 at Przemysl.  With the situation reaching critical levels, your unsatisfactory command must be retained in the service of the Tsar.  Do not fail Russia again!
