Commander, we have met with heavy German opposition in the area around Avranches. We know that at least one crack SS panzer division is in the vicinity. You are the only Armored force we can spare to send in at this time. General Patton has agreed to send help as soon as possible but cannot get anything more than a scouting force in for at least a few days. Avranches must be captured and the Germans driven out as quickly as possible.
