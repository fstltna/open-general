The First World War - The Marne Again - July, 15th, 1918

Ma chère Fabienne,
During their "Operation Marneschutz-Reims" the Germans overran our frontline at the Aisne and they are standing now at the Marne, just like they did in 1914.

But this time, again, we have built a defense line at the Marne. My men and I have arrived just in time.
By the way, I've met a interesting young american officer. I think that his name was Patton. He has real interesting ideas about tank warfare.

Je t'aime,

Jean-Babtiste.


ORDERS:
Général Bertaux-Levillain, hold the Marne and wait for our reinforcements. Then lead our advance back to the Aisne.

OBJECTIVES: Take all VH's

REMARKS: In this scenario, the option "Skip first player's turn" is activated. Reinforcements for your counter-attack will arrive on turns  2, 3 and 4.
